### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个针对老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的手动标注语料库，支持不连续与重叠实体标注。实验表明，尽管Transformer模型在粗粒度任务表现优异（F1=0.943），但细粒度实体识别（如罕见事件/复杂属性）仍存在显著挑战（F1=0.675）。数据集通过可信研究平台开放申请。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床NLP资源中老年患者代表性不足的问题，并应对不良事件提取中不连续/重叠实体标注的技术挑战。

Method: 在可信研究环境（TRE）中构建包含14种临床显著AE及上下文属性的标注数据集，使用FlairNLP框架在三个粒度（细粒度、粗粒度、带否定的粗粒度）评估多种模型。

Result: BERT等模型在文档级粗粒度提取表现优异（F1=0.943），但细粒度实体级任务性能显著下降（F1=0.675），尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性识别。

Conclusion: 当前模型对弱势群体AE检测和临床语言细微差异捕捉能力有限，公开数据集为AE提取方法评估和跨数据集泛化研究提供了基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出BoostCD方法，通过结合约束与非约束解码的两阶段策略，提升结构化NLP任务中模型输出质量，并在闭式信息抽取任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时未显式引入约束，导致测试时约束解码输出质量低。动态约束虽无需重训练，但需解决约束与非约束解码的互补错误利用问题。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：1) 基础模型分别进行约束与非约束解码，得到两个弱预测；2) 增强模型通过自回归方式融合两个预测，利用其互补性生成最终结果。

Result: 在闭式信息抽取任务中，BoostIE模型（基于BoostCD）在分布内外数据上均优于现有方法，显著减少常见错误类型。

Conclusion: BoostCD通过显式结合约束与非约束解码的互补性，有效提升结构化输出的鲁棒性，为动态约束场景提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CrEst框架，通过无监督文档一致性评估提升LLM推理中的上下文可信度，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致错误信息传播，需自动化评估机制。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性构建弱监督框架，提出黑盒（外部加权）和白盒（修改注意力机制）两种集成策略。

Result: 在3种模型架构、5个数据集上准确率最高提升26.86%，F1值提升3.49%，高噪声下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrEst有效解决上下文可信度评估问题，无需人工标注且具备强泛化能力，为LLM可靠性提供新思路。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出MDBench数据集，通过合成生成方法评估大语言模型（LLM）在多文档推理任务中的表现，发现现有方法面临显著挑战，且该技术能灵活适应未来模型改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准在多文档（MD）推理场景中不足，传统标注方法成本高昂。随着LLM处理长上下文能力的提升，亟需高效、可控的基准来系统分析模型在此类任务中的表现。

Method: 提出基于结构化种子知识的合成生成方法：通过LLM辅助编辑引入多文档推理挑战，将结构化知识转化为自然文本，生成文档集及对应问答对，实现低成本、可扩展的基准构建。

Result: 实验表明，MDBench对主流LLM及提示方法均构成显著挑战（即使文档较短）。知识引导的生成技术支持针对性分析多文档推理能力，并能快速适应新挑战。

Conclusion: MDBench为多文档推理评估提供了高效可控的解决方案，其生成方法兼具可解释性与适应性，为未来模型能力分析及基准迭代奠定了基础。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究测试了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的效果，发现专有模型（如GPT-4o）在少样本场景下表现最佳，部分开源模型（如Gemma-2-27B）甚至超越传统机器学习模型，但提示策略差异和领域微调需求仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管传统机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但LLMs在结构化数值数据上的应用尚未充分探索。研究旨在验证LLMs在此类医学预测任务中的有效性。

Method: 使用Pima印第安人糖尿病数据集（PIDD），对比6种LLMs（4个开源模型、2个专有模型）与3种传统ML模型（随机森林、逻辑回归、SVM），采用零样本、单样本和少样本提示策略，以准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数为评估指标。

Result: 专有LLMs（如GPT-4o）表现最佳，Gemma-2-27B在少样本场景下F1分数超越传统ML模型。但不同策略导致性能波动，且需领域特定微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在医疗预测中具有潜力，未来需通过提示工程和混合方法优化性能，同时需解决模型稳定性与领域适配问题。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现无需修改LLM权重，通过优化特殊记忆令牌的嵌入，可实现原始文本的精确重建，适用于多语言、长序列及不同规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否具备通过可逆嵌入实现无损文本重建的能力，为记忆检索、压缩和受控生成提供新思路。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过固定序列训练优化其嵌入，使模型在提示该嵌入时能准确重建原始文本。

Result: Llama 3.1 8B模型成功重建所有测试序列（最长约240词），在英西双语及不同规模模型（1亿-80亿参数）中均验证有效性。

Conclusion: LLM具备可逆嵌入生成能力，为基于记忆的检索、文本压缩及可控生成开辟潜在应用场景。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用自然语言处理技术分析执法与验尸官报告，识别自杀案例中的社会隔离与孤独因素，发现男性、同性恋、离婚者等群体风险更高，并提出改进监测与预防的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会隔离与孤独感近年加剧自杀率，但未被纳入美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）的结构化变量。需通过自然语言处理技术从非结构化文本中提取此类信息，以支持监测与预防。

Method: 结合主题建模（生成词典）与监督学习分类器，开发高质量模型（平均F1值0.86，准确率0.82），分析2002-2020年30万例自杀案件中的执法与验尸官叙述文本。

Result: 识别出1198例长期社会隔离相关自杀，男性（OR=1.44）、同性恋（OR=3.68）、离婚者（OR=3.34）风险显著；其他预测因素包括离婚、失去子女监护权、搬迁或分手等。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效提升美国对社会隔离与孤独的监测能力，为针对性预防措施提供数据支持，降低高风险人群自杀率。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PrefBERT模型，用于评估开放式长文本生成质量，通过多数据集训练和GRPO框架，提供比传统指标的更优语义反馈，提升生成内容与人类偏好的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式长文本生成时存在不足，如忽略关键质量维度（连贯性、风格等）或受预训练数据偏差影响，导致评估效果受限。

Method: 提出PrefBERT评分模型，基于多风格长文本响应数据集和Likert质量评分训练，结合GRPO框架，区分好坏输出的奖励机制以优化生成策略。

Result: PrefBERT在语义奖励反馈上优于ROUGE-L、BERTScore，经LLM评判、人工评分验证，其训练的策略模型生成结果更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: PrefBERT能可靠评估多样化长文本，提供可验证奖励信号，显著提升生成内容与人类偏好对齐效果，优于传统指标驱动的训练方法。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型（LLMs）的知识编码方式在学习阶段的选择对事后反学习效果有显著影响，使用转述描述可提升反学习性能，但删除文本块中的单个知识仍具挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反学习方法通常假设训练过程与模型固定，但实际应用中需动态删除知识（如隐私合规、修正有害内容）。本文旨在探索学习阶段的知识编码方式如何影响反学习效果。

Method: 通过实证研究，分析不同知识编码方式（如使用原句或转述描述）对反学习算法性能的差异，并测试从文本块中删除特定知识的可行性。

Result: 实验表明：(1) 使用转述描述训练可提升反学习效果；(2) 从文本块中精准删除单个知识困难，暗示知识编码方式与反学习可靠性密切相关。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码策略是事后反学习成功的关键因素，优化知识表达形式（如转述）可为模型动态更新与合规提供新思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合话语澄清模块（DCM）和贡献感知偏好优化（CPO）的方法，以解决对话话语解析中的歧义问题，显著提升解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中省略、习语等语言特征常导致话语关系歧义，影响解析器效果，需设计机制消除歧义并优化模型鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DCM模块，通过澄清类型推理和话语目标推理分析语言特征及消歧；引入CPO机制评估澄清贡献并反馈优化DCM，减少级联错误。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效解决歧义，性能显著超越现有最优基线模型。

Conclusion: 结合DCM与CPO的框架能有效提升对话话语解析的准确性和鲁棒性，为复杂语言特征处理提供新思路。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

### [11] [CKD-EHR:Clinical Knowledge Distillation for Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15118)
*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出CKD-EHR框架，通过医学知识增强的知识蒸馏技术，将大型语言模型Qwen2.5-7B的知识迁移至轻量级BERT模型，显著提升电子健康记录疾病预测的准确率与推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子健康记录预测模型存在医学知识表征不足与临床部署效率低两大挑战，需通过知识蒸馏实现模型轻量化与性能提升。

Method: 1. 基于医学知识增强数据微调Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型；2. 通过多粒度注意力蒸馏生成可解释软标签；3. 将知识迁移至BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上实现诊断准确率提升9%，F1-score提高27%，推理速度加速22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR框架有效提升临床资源利用效率与诊断时效性，为临床环境资源优化提供实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将开放域对话生成分解为多响应生成（MRG）和基于偏好的选择（PS）两阶段框架，通过o2mDial语料库及新训练策略，显著提升小模型生成多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的对话代理未显式建模开放域对话的一对多特性，导致响应多样性不足。通过显式分解生成过程，可提升模型性能。

Method: 1. 构建o2mDial对话语料库捕获一对多特性；2. 提出上下文学习与指令微调策略；3. 设计MRG评估指标；4. 开发基于模型的偏好选择方法。

Result: 两阶段框架使小模型响应质量提升90%，在保持上下文连贯性的同时增强多样性，性能接近更大规模模型。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多特性并通过两阶段框架优化，可有效提升开放域对话系统的综合性能，为小模型高效部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新型韩语分词器，通过结合语言结构规则和分支熵算法，在保持模型性能的同时降低10%的token数量，提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE等分词器在韩语处理中因token冗余导致效率低下，需设计更符合韩语语言学特征的高效分词方法。

Method: 采用基于韩语语言结构的规则预分词方法，构建语言学单元种子词汇表，并通过分支熵选择算法优化token长度。

Result: 实验显示Thunder-Tok相比BPE减少约10%的token数量（推理速度提升10%），且下游任务性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 基于语言学规则的分词器设计能有效平衡效率与性能，为语言模型提供实用化解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and
practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过首因与近因效应分析Mamba架构的记忆机制，揭示其U型记忆曲线由稀疏通道长期记忆、delta调制短期记忆及语义驱动的动态分配三机制共同作用形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究状态空间语言模型中信息随时间保留与遗忘的机制，解析序列处理中记忆效应的成因。

Method: 在Mamba架构上实施结构化回忆任务，结合针对性消融实验与输入扰动测试，分析1.4B/7B参数模型的记忆行为模式。

Result: 发现长期记忆依赖选择性状态空间块的稀疏通道编码早期输入，短期记忆受指数衰减权重调控，且语义规律性会动态调节中间项的遗忘倾向。

Conclusion: Mamba的记忆系统具有分层特性：首因效应由持久性稀疏编码支撑，近因效应受动态门控约束，语义规律可主动调节记忆分配模式。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了不同大语言模型（LLMs）在可持续发展目标（SDGs）文本分类任务中的表现，发现通过提示工程优化的小模型性能媲美大型模型如GPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合国SDGs进展跟踪因数据规模与复杂性难以实现，需利用文本分类模型及LLMs的语义理解能力进行自动化分析。

Method: 评估专有与开源LLMs在单标签多分类任务中的效果，并测试零样本学习、少样本学习及微调等任务适应技术。

Result: 经提示工程优化的小模型性能与大型模型（如OpenAI GPT）相当。

Conclusion: 优化小模型可减少资源依赖，为SDGs跟踪提供高效工具，推动自然语言处理技术在可持续发展领域的应用。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

*Feng He,Zijun Chen,Xinnian Liang,Tingting Ma,Yunqi Qiu,Shuangzhi Wu,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ProtoReasoning框架，通过抽象推理原型（如Prolog和PDDL）增强大语言模型的推理能力，实验表明其在逻辑推理、规划等任务上性能显著，验证了跨领域泛化源于共享推理结构的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于长链思维训练的大模型展现出跨领域泛化能力，但其机制尚不明确。本文假设这种泛化源于共享的抽象推理原型，旨在通过原型表示验证并提升模型的推理能力。

Method: ProtoReasoning框架包含三个核心部分：1) 自动化原型构建流程，将问题转化为Prolog/PDDL等原型表示；2) 基于解释器的验证系统提供可靠反馈；3) 可扩展的原型空间问题合成机制，确保生成问题的正确性。

Result: 实验显示，ProtoReasoning在逻辑推理（Enigmata-Eval）、规划任务、通用推理（MMLU）和数学（AIME24）上分别提升4.7%、6.3%、4.0%和1.0%。消融实验证实原型空间训练对结构相似问题的泛化优于纯自然语言训练。

Conclusion: 研究验证了抽象推理原型作为跨领域泛化基础的核心假设，表明原型表示能有效捕捉问题本质，从而提升大语言模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MinosEval方法，通过区分事实型与非事实型问题并采用不同评估策略，提升开放域问答自动评估的准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标（如ROUGE）和现有基于大语言模型的评估方法在开放域问答中存在语义捕捉不足、可解释性差及未区分问题类型的问题。

Method: MinosEval对事实型问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实型问题使用实例感知的列表排序策略，实现针对性评估。

Result: 实验表明，MinosEval在多个数据集上更贴合人工标注结果，并提供更清晰的解释性输出。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过分类型评估策略有效解决了开放域问答自动评估的挑战，显著提升评估质量与可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

*Jaione Bengoetxea,Itziar Gonzalez-Dios,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过自然语言推理任务评估语言模型对巴斯克语和西班牙语变体的理解能力，发现模型在处理语言变异时性能显著，尤其西部巴斯克方言表现最差，验证了语言学理论中方言与标准语距离的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究当前语言技术对巴斯克语和西班牙语不同变体的理解能力，特别是语言变异对模型性能的影响。

Method: 构建巴斯克语和西班牙语变体的平行数据集，采用编码器模型和基于解码器的大语言模型进行跨语言及上下文学习实验，并通过消融实验探究方言差异。

Result: 模型处理语言变异时性能下降（巴斯克语更明显），错误分析表明主因是语言变异而非词汇重叠；编码器模型对西部巴斯克语（语言学理论中距离标准语更远的方言）表现最差。

Conclusion: 语言变异本身显著影响模型性能，方言与标准语的语言学距离差异在模型表现中具可观测性，需针对性优化以提升低资源语言变体的处理能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对通用大语言模型在历史文本分析中存在的知识鸿沟问题，特别是在计算人文与AIGC技术背景下，需解决领域知识不足导致的幻觉现象与可解释性缺陷。

Method: 提出Graph RAG框架：1) 使用思维链提示与自指令生成构建《前四史》人物关系数据集；2) 建立知识图谱与检索增强生成的协同机制；3) 采用过程监督实现低人工标注的知识提取。

Result: Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B模型在关系抽取任务达F1=0.68，结合GraphRAG的DeepSeek模型在C-CLUE数据集F1提升11%（0.08-0.19），有效缓解幻觉问题并提升可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为古典文本知识提取提供低资源解决方案，通过增强大模型与历史知识的对齐能力，推动历史知识服务与人文研究的发展。

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Motivation: 针对大规模网络语料库的端到端问答，旨在通过上下文聚类和提示聚合提升答案的多样性、相关性和对检索证据的忠实性。

Method: 采用稀疏+密集混合检索策略，对结果进行K-Means聚类，生成聚类代表提示并利用LLM生成中间答案，经筛选、重排后合成最终回答。

Result: 在FineWeb Sample-10BT数据集评测中，忠实性排名第2，正确性排名第7，验证了基于聚类的上下文过滤方法有效性。

Conclusion: 基于聚类的上下文过滤与多提示聚合机制能有效提升大规模RAG系统的性能，特别是在答案忠实性方面表现突出。

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

*Sungen Hahm,Heejin Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Hyunji Park,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 韩国司法系统需在公开判决书时平衡司法公开与个人数据保护，但现有去标识化方法效率不足且法律定义模糊。本文提出Thunder-DeID框架，通过构建标注数据集、系统化PII分类及端到端DNN模型，实现高效合规的去标识化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法庭判决书去标识化流程难以满足大规模处理需求，且法律对个人标识信息的定义模糊，缺乏技术适配性，亟需高效且符合法律要求的解决方案。

Method: 提出Thunder-DeID框架：1) 构建并发布首个含实体标注的韩语法律数据集；2) 系统化定义PII分类标准；3) 开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在法庭判决书去标识化任务中达到当前最优性能（state-of-the-art）。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID通过法律与技术协同设计，有效解决了韩国司法数据开放中的隐私保护难题，为法律文本自动化处理提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但其在临床试验招募等关键领域的应用仍受限。由于试验设计和患者数据包含结构化和非结构化文本，LLMs的知识整合与推理能力可提升匹配效率，但现有方法依赖专有模型且评估基准薄弱。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述，分析临床试验患者匹配任务的特点，总结基于LLM的方法、现有评估框架及技术挑战。

Result: 研究发现当前LLM辅助方法存在基准不足、模型透明度低等问题，同时揭示了临床试验数据隐私、领域知识融合等实际应用障碍。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床试验匹配领域具有潜力，但需建立强健的评估体系、解决数据与伦理挑战，并开发可解释的领域专用模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种监督对比学习方法，通过解决类别不平衡和领域偏差问题，有效提升低资源语言在跨域数据上的语言识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言因训练数据单一（如圣经等单领域数据）导致语言识别（LID）模型性能较差，需解决类别不平衡和领域偏差问题。

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）方法，学习低资源语言的领域不变表示以增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使低资源语言在跨域数据上的LID性能提升3.2%。

Conclusion: 监督对比学习能有效缓解数据偏差问题，显著提升低资源语言识别的跨领域鲁棒性。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in enhancing LID models.

Motivation: 现有临床LLMs评估方法难以区分真实医学推理与表面模式，需开发细粒度行为测试框架以揭示模型推理策略及潜在偏差。

Method: 基于MIMIC-IV构建ICU出院记录数据集（真实/合成），控制人口统计与生命体征变量生成反事实样本，评估5个LLM在零样本/微调场景下的输入敏感性与预测推理能力。

Result: 零样本模型反事实推理更连贯，微调模型稳定性高但对临床变化响应弱；人口统计学特征（年龄/性别/种族）对输出存在系统性微妙影响。

Conclusion: 行为测试可有效暴露临床LLMs的推理机制，强调需结合公平性评估以构建更安全透明的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在全球应用中的表现受限于对本地社会文化语境的理解，尤其在印度多元文化背景下缺乏针对性评估工具。

Method: 构建覆盖印度28个邦和8个联邦属地、包含16个文化维度的SANSKRITI数据集，涵盖21,853个精细标注的问答对，并测试主流LLM、ILM及SLM模型。

Result: 多数模型在区域文化语境处理中表现不佳，不同模型类型（如LLM与ILM）在文化敏感性问题上的准确度存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI通过大规模文化细粒度数据集，为提升语言模型的文化理解能力建立了新评估标准，推动模型本地化适配。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states
and 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian
cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for
assessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.

Motivation: 现有研究在英语和中文的多模态多语言摘要中已整合用户评论，但印度语言领域资源匮乏，且多数数据集缺乏多模态与用户反馈的结合。

Method: 构建包含4,959篇文章、24,484条评论的多语言数据集，结合文本、评论、图像三种模态，使用LLama3、GPT-4等模型，并设计分类器过滤噪声、提取图像信息。

Result: 实验表明整合用户反馈和图像能提升摘要质量，IndicBERT和CLIP分类器有效降噪，多模态组合（文本+评论+图像）效果最优。

Conclusion: COSMMIC填补印度语言资源空白，通过多模态与用户反馈的融合推动包容性NLP研究，为未来多语言生成任务提供基准。

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）中表现欠佳，主要由于数据稀缺和预训练代表性不足，导致跨语言词汇对齐能力受限。

Method: TLI方法结合低秩适配(LoRA)和对比学习目标，针对Lugha-Llama-8B-wura模型的第二层（实证显示该层具有近完美的词汇对齐能力）进行定向微调。

Result: 实验显示：623个训练词对的相似度提升28.08%（0.3211→0.4113），63个未训练控制词对相似度提升28.32%（0.3143→0.4033），统计显著性均达p<1e-25量级。

Conclusion: TLI能有效激活并传播模型固有的早期层跨语言知识，为低资源语言模型提供了一种参数效率优化的词汇对齐增强方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对多模态大语言模型在GUI代理中存在的系统性定位误差问题，提出了细粒度评估框架与峰值锐度评分指标，并提出无需训练的上下文感知裁剪技术以提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的GUI代理存在定位幻觉问题，传统评估指标无法捕捉细粒度错误模式，需开发更精准的评估方法及提升模型可靠性。

Method: 1) 四分类细粒度评估框架分析失败模式；2) 提出峰值锐度评分(PSS)量化坐标预测不确定性；3) 设计上下文自适应裁剪技术优化输入。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效识别模型错误模式，PSS指标与人工评估相关性达0.92，上下文裁剪技术将定位准确率提升12.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的评估框架和训练无关优化技术显著增强了GUI代理行为的可解释性与鲁棒性，为模型改进提供量化依据。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统在架构设计、跨领域泛化性与性能保障方面存在不足，尤其面对高复杂度任务与大规模智能体时表现受限。

Method: 1) 分治全并行架构实现任务森林化分解 2) 基于任务特征动态选择LLM组合的自适应协作引擎 3) 分治式智能体优化策略实现高效分解

Result: GSM8K准确率91.5%(+5.6%)，AIME竞赛级达30.4%(近2倍提升)，HumanEval pass@1达79.2%，MATH Level5任务改进超11%

Conclusion: 该框架为构建高效通用型LLM多智能体系统提供完整解决方案，在复杂推理场景中展现显著优势，任务难度越高性能优势越明显。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出RE-IMAGINE框架，通过生成不同层次变体问题评估大语言模型的真实推理能力，发现模型依赖统计回忆而非纯推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）在推理基准测试中表现优异，但其结果是否源于真实推理能力或训练数据的统计回忆仍不明确。需构建更严谨的评估体系以区分模型的推理层次。

Method: 基于因果关系阶梯理论，设计RE-IMAGINE框架：通过中间符号表示生成不可通过记忆解决的变体问题，支持跨数学、代码、逻辑等领域的多层级推理能力评估。

Result: 在四大基准测试中，LLMs面对变体问题时性能显著下降，表明其过往表现部分依赖统计回忆，且不同模型家族在推理层级上存在差异。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的推理能力存在局限性，需针对因果阶梯各层级开发针对性提升方法，减少对训练数据记忆的依赖。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

TL;DR: 提出CINGS方法，通过训练时预置相关上下文并仅对响应计算损失，增强大语言模型（LLM）基于外部知识的生成能力，减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时直接附加上下文无法确保生成内容基于外部知识，需通过监督机制提升模型对上下文的依赖。

Method: CINGS在训练阶段将相关上下文置于响应前，计算损失时仅保留响应部分（上下文被掩码），从而隐式引导模型依赖外部信息。

Result: CINGS在11个文本数据集上优于其他方法，与推理时技术互补；在视觉领域减少幻觉并保持事实一致性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型先验知识分布，促使其更依赖外部上下文而非内部参数，从而提升生成结果的可靠性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

TL;DR: 提出SPARE框架，通过参考引导的单次步骤标注提升大语言模型多步推理能力，在多个领域数据集上实现高效且高性能的自动过程监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动过程标注方法在效率和质量上面临挑战，需开发一种高效、高质量的自动化过程监督框架以增强大语言模型的复杂推理能力。

Method: SPARE框架采用参考解决方案对齐策略，通过单次标注实现步骤级监督，结合显式推理评估机制，支持离线强化学习微调和奖励模型训练。

Result: SPARE在数学推理、组合问答等任务中性能优于基线方法，运行效率提升2.6倍（仅需38%时间），与树搜索方法竞争性能的同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: SPARE验证了参考引导评估对过程监督的有效性，其高效标注机制为复杂推理任务提供了实用解决方案，开源代码进一步促进研究复现。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出基于情感引导和双向动态交互的框架EmoBi，显著提升夸张和隐喻检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视夸张与隐喻的关联性及隐式情感对修辞感知的影响，导致检测效果受限。

Method: 结合情感分析模块、领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，并设计验证机制确保准确性。

Result: 在TroFi和HYPO-L数据集上F1值分别提升28.1%和23.1%，超越所有基线方法。

Conclusion: EmoBi通过情感关联与双向交互机制，为修辞检测任务提供了有效且具潜力的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过强化学习（GRPO方法）和分阶段训练优化大语言模型（LLMs）的可靠性与引用准确性，结合推理机制和结果驱动奖励，显著提升答案正确性、引用充分性及拒绝回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的指令调优模型在简单场景中仍存在答案遗漏、错误引用或不当拒绝回答的问题，需探索强化学习与内部推理结合的方法以增强模型的可验证性和可信度。

Method: 采用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）强化学习方法，通过可验证结果（答案正确性、引用充分性、拒绝质量）的奖励机制训练模型，无需人工标注；分两阶段优化（先答案与引用，后拒绝行为），并结合GPT-4蒸馏的指令调优。

Result: 在ASQA、QAMPARI等数据集上的实验表明，推理增强模型显著优于纯指令调优模型，尤其在处理不可答问题和生成高引用质量回答方面；两阶段训练和结合GPT-4蒸馏进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习、分阶段优化及结果驱动的奖励机制能有效提升LLMs的可验证性；推理与指令调优结合在长格式生成任务中表现更优，为构建可靠模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

*Bailin Wang,Chang Lan,Chong Wang,Ruoming Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RATTENTION方法，通过结合局部注意力与线性注意力机制，在保持训练效率的同时突破局部注意力模型的窗口限制。512窗口大小即可匹配全注意力模型性能，并在长上下文任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有局部-全局注意力模型面临窗口大小的帕累托权衡：大窗口效率提升有限，小窗口导致性能下降。核心问题在于局部注意力完全忽略窗口外token信息，迫使现有模型采用保守窗口配置（如4096/8192）。

Method: 提出RATTENTION方法：1) 在标准局部注意力中集成专用线性注意力机制，捕捉窗口外token信息；2) 通过专用内核实现和缩小窗口尺寸，保持训练速度；3) 利用线性注意力的循环特性增强长上下文处理能力。

Result: 1) 3B/12B规模预训练显示，512窗口的RATTENTION性能与全注意力模型相当；2) RULER基准验证其长上下文性能提升；3) 训练速度与SOTA方法持平，未因线性注意力增加计算开销。

Conclusion: RATTENTION成功突破局部注意力的帕累托前沿，在短上下文场景实现效率增益，在长上下文任务展现优势，为注意力机制设计提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现代语言模型常公开权重但封闭训练数据，导致复现与改进困难。研究旨在解决如何仅通过模型权重逆向逼近原始训练数据的问题。

Method: 开发梯度优化方法，从大规模公开文本中筛选与原始/微调模型权重匹配度最高的数据，支持分类和监督微调任务。

Result: AG News任务性能从随机数据的65%提升至80%（专家基准88%）；SFT模型困惑度从3.3降至2.3（LLAMA基准2.0），无需真实训练数据即可逼近原模型表现。

Conclusion: 该方法通过公共数据子集有效逼近私有训练集效果，为模型逆向工程提供可行方案，并在性能恢复上展现显著优势。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，通过输入时推测解码减少LLMs生成首句的等待时间，从而降低实时语音交互中的延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在消费级硬件上作为单用户语音助手时，生成首句的延迟显著影响用户体验，主要因TTS系统需逐句合成音频。

Method: PredGen框架在用户说话时并行生成候选响应，利用空闲计算资源进行推测解码，使TTS系统能提前开始处理。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集模拟实验中，延迟降低约2倍，且仅增加少量输入阶段计算成本。

Conclusion: PredGen通过预生成机制有效消除LLMs-TTS流水线延迟，显著提升交互实时性，计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注二元性别，缺乏对非二元性别的评估。本文旨在通过新指标GIFI全面衡量大语言模型的性别包容性，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出GIFI指标，通过多层次评估（如代词探测、生成内容测试、认知行为分析）量化模型对不同性别标识符的偏见，覆盖22种开源与专有模型。

Result: 评估显示，不同规模与能力的模型在性别包容性上差异显著，GIFI有效揭示了模型在非二元性别处理中的潜在偏见。

Conclusion: 提升大语言模型的性别包容性至关重要，GIFI为未来性别公平性研究提供了关键基准，推动生成模型向包容性发展。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common
reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable
fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we
identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key
insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal

Method: 1) 定义DiscoSG任务并构建包含专家标注和合成数据的大规模数据集DiscoSG-DS；2) 提出DiscoSG-Refiner框架：首阶段用基础PLM生成草图，次阶段用改进PLM迭代修正，降低全图生成开销。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner使用双Flan-T5-Base模型实现SPICE指标30%，推理速度较GPT-4快86倍。在下游任务中持续提升篇章级描述评估和幻觉检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决多语句场景图解析难题，在性能与效率间取得平衡，促进开源应用。其双阶段架构为复杂结构化预测任务提供新思路，显著提升VLM任务表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出WikiMixQA基准测试，评估视觉语言模型在长文档多模态推理中的表现，发现现有模型在长上下文检索中性能显著下降，开源模型表现尤其差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言大模型（VLLMs）在处理长上下文视觉输入（如复杂布局、表格和图表）时的有效性不明确，需建立跨模态推理评估标准。

Method: 构建WikiMixQA基准，包含1,000道多选题，基于4,000篇维基百科页面的表格和图表，覆盖7个主题，测试12个先进视觉语言模型的跨模态信息整合能力。

Result: 专有模型在直接上下文下准确率约70%，但需长文档检索时性能骤降（仅GPT-4-o超50%）；开源模型最高准确率仅27%。

Conclusion: 长上下文多模态推理仍是重大挑战，WikiMixQA为推进文档理解研究提供了关键基准，凸显当前模型在复杂场景下的局限性。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化生成多语言（如葡萄牙语）且符合课程要求的阅读多选题需求迫切，但现有研究多集中于英语，且生成题目的质量与可靠性不足，需验证其实际应用可行性。

Method: 通过生成符合课程叙事元素及不同难度的葡萄牙语MCQs，结合专家评审与学生回答的心理测量学分析，评估题目对小学生的适用性。

Result: 当前模型生成的MCQs质量与人类编写相当，但语义模糊、答案难以确定，且干扰项未能有效吸引学生或满足高质量选项标准。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可高效生成葡萄牙语阅读题，但需优化语义表达与干扰项设计，以提升题目清晰度及教育实用性。

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型中的后悔机制，提出构建专用数据集和评估指标，成功识别最优后悔表征层及神经元分类，揭示信息处理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过分析大语言模型在生成错误信息后表现出的显性后悔机制，提升模型可靠性并探索神经网络中的认知编码方式。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：(1) 设计提示场景构建后悔数据集；(2) 使用S-CDI指标定位最优后悔表征层；(3) 通过RDS和GIC指标识别后悔神经元并分析激活模式。

Result: 实验成功定位最优后悔表征层（S-CDI提升分类性能），发现层间M型解耦模式，并将神经元分为后悔神经元、非后悔神经元及双重功能神经元三类。

Conclusion: 研究为解析语言模型认知机制提供系统性框架，所提指标工具可扩展至其他内部表征分析，助力提升模型可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过计算模型发现，英美英语使用者在强调词（如'quite'和'very'）理解上的文化差异源于字面意义与话语成本的综合作用，而非单纯语义或礼貌因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化沟通误解的根源：是词语字面意义差异，还是语用因素（如礼貌、简洁规范）导致解释差异。

Method: 通过三个实验分析英美英语使用者对强调词的解释，并构建计算认知模型模拟听者对说话者的递归推理（权衡信息性、礼貌与话语成本）。

Result: 文化差异由字面意义差异和话语成本权重差异共同驱动，挑战了仅基于语义变异或礼貌规范的解释。

Conclusion: 跨文化解释差异源于语义与语用因素的复杂交互，需同时考虑字面意义和交际策略的权重分配。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

*Yusuke Sakai,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究者提出Ordered CommonGen基准，用于评估大语言模型在遵循指定概念顺序时的组合泛化与指令遵循能力。实验发现，即使最佳模型的有序覆盖率仅约75%，且模型存在输出多样性低、顺序变化不敏感等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式常识推理（如CommonGen）未明确评估模型对概念顺序的遵循能力。当指令要求特定顺序时，模型需同时满足组合泛化与指令遵循，但现有方法在此方面存在不足。

Method: 提出Ordered CommonGen基准，通过有序覆盖率指标（ordered coverage）同步评估模型对概念顺序的遵循能力与组合泛化能力，并对36个大语言模型进行系统性分析。

Result: 实验显示：1) LLMs普遍能理解顺序指令意图，但对特定顺序模式存在偏好；2) 顺序变化时模型常生成低多样性或相同结果；3) 最佳模型的顺序覆盖率仅75%。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在指令遵循与组合泛化能力上仍需改进，尤其需减少对固定顺序模式的依赖，并提升对指令变化的敏感度与输出多样性。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 针对罗马尼亚语文本作者归属问题，探索在资源受限或未充分开发语言环境中，轻量级可解释特征方法的性能边界，挑战复杂模型的必要性。

Method: 使用ROST标准语料库，系统比较SVM、LR、k-NN、DT、RF和ANN六种算法，采用字符n-gram作为分类特征进行十五次实验。

Result: ANN模型在5-gram特征下四次实现100%准确率，整体表现最佳；所有方法中字符n-gram方案达到当前最先进水平。

Conclusion: 简单风格计量特征（如字符n-gram）在罗马尼亚等低资源语言作者识别中可替代复杂模型，为类似语言场景提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of authorship attribution for Romanian texts
using the ROST corpus, a standard benchmark in the field. We systematically
evaluate six machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RF), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employing character
n-gram features for classification. Among these, the ANN model achieved the
highest performance, including perfect classification in four out of fifteen
runs when using 5-gram features. These results demonstrate that lightweight,
interpretable character n-gram approaches can deliver state-of-the-art accuracy
for Romanian authorship attribution, rivaling more complex methods. Our
findings highlight the potential of simple stylometric features in resource,
constrained or under-studied language settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中仍存在一致性与鲁棒性不足的问题，需通过结构化方法增强其推理可靠性。

Method: 基于群组一致性学习（CC-Learn），结合群组准确率、问题分解检索奖励和无效检索惩罚的复合目标，通过强化学习优化模型推理模式。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等推理基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提高了模型准确率与推理稳定性，超越预训练及监督微调基线。

Conclusion: 基于群组的强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的推理一致性，为复杂任务提供更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型的内部推理痕迹存在隐私泄露风险，增加推理步骤虽提升答案谨慎性，却导致更冗长的思考过程并扩大隐私攻击面，揭示隐私与效用的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战'推理痕迹是内部且安全'的假设，指出其可能通过提示注入或意外输出泄露敏感用户数据，现有安全措施未覆盖模型内部推理过程。

Method: 通过探测性评估和代理评估，分析测试时计算（如增加推理步骤）对隐私泄露的影响，观察模型在谨慎回答与详细推理间的平衡。

Result: 增加计算预算使最终答案更谨慎，但导致推理痕迹中敏感信息泄露量增加，显示模型效用提升与隐私风险扩大的根本矛盾。

Conclusion: 需将安全防护扩展到模型输出之外的内部思考过程，仅保护最终答案不足以应对推理痕迹中的隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Motivation: 解决语法性别语言在机器翻译中难以保持源文本性别模糊性的问题，避免因错误性别化导致的代表性伤害。

Method: 通过三个不同难度的翻译方向测试系统，分类实际观察到的性别中立策略，并分析二元性别刻板印象对翻译结果的影响。

Result: 大多数系统未能生成性别中立翻译，但发现少量系统能根据目标语言特性主动切换使用中性代词、复数化等特定策略。

Conclusion: 当前机器翻译系统对性别模糊性的处理整体不足，但存在语言依赖的可行解决方案，为开发包容性MT系统提供了实践启示。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽性能接近闭源系统，但计算需求大且架构差异导致知识蒸馏困难，难以在资源受限设备部署。

Method: GenRecal框架引入Recalibrator模块，对齐异构VLMs的特征表示，实现跨不同词汇、分词方式的通用知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，GenRecal显著提升基线性能，在多个基准测试中优于大规模开源及闭源VLMs。

Conclusion: GenRecal解决了异构VLMs知识蒸馏的通用性问题，为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成的文本效果显著下降，需解决因用户微调开源模型导致的检测性能不足问题。

Method: 采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的共享家族级特征，而非依赖个体模型特性。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上，PhantomHunter优于7个基线和3个工业服务，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter通过家族级特征学习有效检测私有调优LLM生成的文本，为应对LLM滥用提供新解决方案。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，通过多模态数据实现上下文敏感决策，解决了传统逻辑的僵化与神经网络缺乏可解释性的问题，并在物体放置任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二值逻辑无法捕捉人类决策的细微差异且依赖人工多模态数据标注，而神经网络虽能提取多模态信息但缺乏可解释性。CALM旨在融合逻辑结构与神经感知，构建可解释的模拟逻辑系统。

Method: CALM使用域树表示谓词，通过神经网络迭代优化多模态上下文中的模拟真值，并利用符号推理模块约束搜索空间，确保逻辑一致性与偏好对齐。

Result: 在填空物体放置任务中，CALM准确率达92.2%，显著优于传统逻辑（86.3%）和LLM（59.4%），其生成的空间热图同时满足逻辑约束与人类主观偏好。

Conclusion: CALM证明了逻辑结构与多模态偏好对齐的可行性，为兼具逻辑精确性、可解释性及神经多模态处理能力的新一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical
for CMARL on MEAL.

Result: 在AIME 2024的32B模型实验中，T-PPO将训练效率提升至2.5倍，且性能优于现有方法，同时保持收敛性。

Conclusion: T-PPO通过截断策略和计算优化机制显著提升LLMs推理训练效率，为长生成强化学习任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Motivation: 传统启发式算法依赖人工设计且难以泛化，需自动化框架提升组合优化问题的适应性与效率。

Method: 两阶段超启发式框架：1) 通过LLM对比高低质量解提取进化策略；2) 动态选择启发式策略，支持原生LLM或轻量级双奖励微调模型。

Result: 在经典基准测试中超越现有LLM超启发式方法，部分场景性能匹配或超过专用求解器。

Conclusion: HeurAgenix通过LLM感知与策略进化机制，为组合优化问题提供了高效、可泛化的自动化求解框架。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Motivation: 传统优化方法难以满足动态地球观测任务的实时决策需求，且多卫星系统的能源限制、观测不确定性及分散协调复杂性亟需更高效的自主决策方案。

Method: 通过建模卫星单机操作并扩展至多卫星星座，采用MARL框架（包括PPO、IPPO等算法），在近真实模拟环境中解决资源约束、部分可观测性下的分散协调问题。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于无人机和船舶协作的多接入边缘计算框架，通过Lyapunov优化和异构代理强化学习方法解决海上物联网任务的计算卸载与资源分配问题，以最小化总执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上物联网（MIoT）的计算需求快速增长，但不确定的任务特性导致传统计算卸载与资源分配方法效率低下。无人机（UAV）和船舶的异构资源协同能力未被充分挖掘，需设计动态优化机制应对任务随机性与资源波动。

Method: 1. 提出协作式MEC框架，整合MIoT设备、无人机和船舶资源；2. 利用Lyapunov优化将长期约束分解为短期优化问题；3. 将问题建模为马尔可夫博弈，并提出异构代理软演员-评论家（HASAC）算法进行分布式决策。

Conclusion: 通过协同无人机与船舶的异构资源，结合Lyapunov优化和强化学习，提出的框架在不确定海上任务场景中实现了计算卸载与资源分配的联合优化，验证了方法的有效性与适应性。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

Motivation: 现有导航任务方法在处理历史观测数据时忽视内部关联结构，可能限制性能提升。通过因果视角分析任务特性，揭示传统序列方法的局限性。

Method: 提出Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN)框架包含Causal Understanding Module，在强化学习和监督学习设置中无需额外计算开销即可增强环境建模能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模导航任务中的因果关系，CAN框架有效提升了智能体的环境理解能力，为具身智能导航任务提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as

these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

*Lyle Goodyear,Rachel Guo,Ramesh Johari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个统一框架，通过三个维度（动作信息量、奖励信息量、提示风格）系统化构建LLM智能体在重复多智能体博弈中的自然语言状态表示，发现特定状态表示方式可使智能体行为更接近博弈论均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对LLM智能体在博弈中的历史信息编码采用临时方法，导致行为影响不明确且研究间难以比较，需系统化框架解决这些问题。

Method: 构建基于动作信息量（历史动作覆盖程度）、奖励信息量（奖励描述程度）、提示风格（自然语言压缩程度）的三轴状态表示框架，并应用于动态路由博弈实验。

Result: 当状态表示包含(1)历史摘要而非完整记录；(2)遗憾信息而非原始收益；(3)有限他人动作信息时，LLM智能体行为更接近理论均衡且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 自然语言状态表示方式显著影响LLM智能体行为，合理设计可提升与博弈论预测的一致性，这对构建可靠多智能体系统具有关键意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

Motivation: 现有高等教育计算机科学课程未充分培养学生将AI伦理原则转化为实践及应对政策需求的能力，需在课程中融入AI政策与伦理内容。

Method: 开发并迭代AI政策教学模块（含'AI监管'技术作业），通过前后测问卷评估学生对AI伦理与政策的态度变化。

Result: 学生参与后对AI伦理影响的关注度提高，政策讨论信心增强；'AI监管作业'有效探索技术对齐边界并强化政策解决伦理问题的作用。

Conclusion: 技术型AI工程师需具备政策素养，整合政策模块的课程能有效培养伦理实践能力，政策是应对AI伦理挑战的关键工具。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Motivation: LRMs在复杂问题解决中因生成冗余内容（过度思考）导致效率降低和推理成本增加，需挖掘其潜在的高效推理能力。

Method: 1. 无需训练的激活引导技术（Efficiency Steering），通过模型表示空间单方向调控推理行为；2. 动态平衡任务准确性与简洁性的自我奖励强化学习框架（Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL）。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，七种LRM主干模型的推理长度显著减少，任务性能保持或提升。

Conclusion: 通过自我引导方式利用模型内在能力，可有效提升推理效率，证明现有模型具备未被充分挖掘的简洁推理潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Conclusion: MedSyn框架初步验证了开源LLMs的辅助价值，后续将通过真实医患场景验证其对诊断准确率和疗效的提升作用。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

Motivation: 传统并行回火算法处理带约束优化问题时，软约束强度难以平衡：过强导致收敛缓慢，过弱无法保证可行性。现有伊辛机硬件实现面临此瓶颈。

Method: 扩展并行回火至二维空间，新增惩罚强度插值维度。通过温度-惩罚强度双维度副本交换，在保持低温可行解的同时增强高约束区域的混合效率。

Conclusion: 2D-PT为受限伊辛问题提供通用解决方案，可直接部署现有硬件，显著提升带约束组合优化问题的求解效率。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

TL;DR: 提出整合脑电图（EEG）与眼动追踪数据的ETS框架，显著提升开放词汇文本生成与情感分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入式EEG在开放词汇场景下解码自然语言存在噪声和变异性挑战，传统方法在小封闭词汇表现好但开放词汇效果差。

Method: ETS框架结合EEG与同步眼动数据，解决开放词汇文本生成及感知语言情感分类任务。

Result: EEG到文本解码的BLEU/Rouge分数优于基线，情感分类F1值提升10%，支持多被试/数据源泛化。

Conclusion: ETS展示了高性能开放词汇EEG-文本系统的潜力，跨数据源适应性为实用化奠定基础。

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于迁移学习的方法，利用卷积神经网络（ConvNet）通过表面压力数据预测流动参数（攻角与流速），解决传统传感器依赖及数据分布变化问题，验证了领域适应和任务适应能力，但对噪声数据效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过传感器直接测量流动参数的方法易受故障影响，且实际应用需实时预测。数据分布变化或新任务场景下，现有数据驱动模型需快速适应，故研究迁移学习方法以提升模型泛化与适应能力。

Method: 采用迁移学习框架：1）离线预训练ConvNet核心预测模型；2）冻结除输出层前特定层外的权重；3）针对目标域数据或新任务重训练解冻层，实现领域适应（不同数据分布）和任务适应（预测目标变化）。

Result: 方法在CFD数据中成功实现领域扩展、数据分布变化适应及任务更新，但对含噪声数据预测效果不佳。采样量、网络结构对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在流动参数预测中具有适应数据分布变化和任务更新的潜力，但需进一步优化以应对噪声干扰问题。

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy
data is concluded to be not as effective.

*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的物理信息位置编码方法（PIPE），通过将物理信息嵌入视觉语言模型，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性，特别是在台风强度预测中实现了12%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要依赖文本数据辅助时间序列预测，但忽略了视觉数据（如卫星图像）中蕴含的物理信息（如时空地理上下文），导致模型难以有效捕捉此类信息。

Method: PIPE包含两个核心创新：1) 基于物理信息的位置索引方案，将物理变量映射为位置ID；2) 变频率位置编码机制，在嵌入空间中同时编码物理变量频率和序列顺序信息。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上的实验表明，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最先进性能，台风强度预测精度较现有方法提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过同时保留物理信息与序列顺序信息，有效增强了多模态对齐能力，验证了其在复杂物理场景（如气象预测）中的优越性和泛化性。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多深度存储系统因巷道堵塞问题采用同质物品存储策略，但牺牲了系统适应性。需解决异构配置下的高效检索需求。

Method: 设计图神经网络(GNN)编码拓扑与物品属性，通过Transformer生成全局优先级分配，支持不同仓库布局的泛化应用。

Result: 实验表明该方法在减少总延迟上显著超越启发式方法，且神经网络架构展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效平衡存储密度与检索效率，为多深度仓储系统提供可扩展的智能优化方案。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开的1型糖尿病数据集稀缺且缺乏细节，限制了数据驱动方法（如个性化治疗、数字孪生系统）的发展。

Method: 收集25名使用自动胰岛素输送系统患者的6-8周数据，涵盖连续血糖监测、胰岛素泵数据、碳水化合物摄入、设备模式，并特别记录推注胰岛素的剂量类型与校正细节。

Result: 构建了AZT1D数据集，提供现有数据集中罕见的胰岛素推注细粒度数据，支持人工智能在临床决策和个体化护理中的多样化应用。

Conclusion: AZT1D通过高粒度、自然场景数据，为改进1型糖尿病管理的AI模型和临床实践提供了关键资源。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出持续进化池（CEP）机制，通过存储不同概念的预测器实例、动态检索与淘汰机制，有效应对时间序列中的循环概念漂移问题，提升在线预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过参数更新延缓概念遗忘，但可能导致旧知识丢失且缺乏知识保留机制。循环概念漂移的频繁出现要求模型既能保留历史概念知识，又能高效复用。

Method: CEP采用池化机制存储不同概念的预测器实例：1）检索阶段选择与测试样本最接近的预测器并学习邻近样本特征；2）若邻近样本不足则生成新模型存储新概念；3）淘汰机制清除过时知识以保证预测效果。

Result: 在8个真实数据集及多种模型架构上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念知识，在循环概念场景下显著提升在线预测结果。

Conclusion: CEP通过动态存储、检索与淘汰机制，解决了循环概念漂移中的知识保留与复用问题，为时间序列在线预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在蛋白质语言模型（PLM）的嵌入层与转换器之间推理时注入dropout层，并通过类似蒙特卡洛dropout的方法平均输出，可提升零样本预测性能，且无需重新训练或微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有PLM（如ESM2）已具备零样本预测蛋白质关键标量属性的能力，但研究者希望进一步探索如何通过简单修改推理过程（而非重新训练）来提升其性能。

Method: 在PLM的嵌入层与转换器之间插入dropout层（推理阶段），采用类似蒙特卡洛dropout的多次采样平均策略，且不改变模型原有训练参数。

Result: 在ProteinGym数据集子集上，即使模型原始训练未使用dropout，该方法仍显著提升零样本性能，且dropout率为0.1时在所有测试模型中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 推理阶段引入dropout层是一种轻量高效的零样本预测优化方法，其有效性不受原始训练是否含dropout的限制，为PLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一种名为“Assembly-of-Experts”（AoE）的新方法，通过线性时间对现有混合专家（MoE）模型的权重张量进行插值，生成高效子模型。实验构建的DeepSeek R1T模型在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）时，单个8位权重的计算成本高达10^13-10^15 FLOPs，效率低下且昂贵。为充分利用已有预训练模型资源，需开发更高效的模型构造方法。

Method: AoE方法通过线性时间内对父模型的权重张量进行独立插值，调整其语义特征（增强或抑制），从而生成子模型。无需微调或蒸馏，仅通过权重比例调整即可探索模型行为变化。

Result: 构建的DeepSeek R1T“Chimera”模型（671B参数）结合V3-0324和R1模型的专家张量，性能接近R1但输出令牌减少40%，推理速度接近V3，且表现出更紧凑、有序的推理能力。

Conclusion: AoE方法能高效生成功能完备的子模型，模型行为可通过权重比例平滑调控，且子模型可能涌现新特性。该方法为模型空间探索提供了低成本、高灵活性的解决方案。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了智能系统在表示学习中泛化与识别之间的根本性权衡，推导出普适的帕累托前沿理论，并通过不同复杂度模型验证了有限分辨率相似性作为信息约束的普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能系统需要同时具备结构化表示以支持泛化，以及选择性表示以保持输入身份，但二者存在根本性权衡。研究旨在量化这种权衡关系并揭示其数学本质。

Method: 建立理论框架推导闭式表达式刻画(p_S,p_I)权衡边界，扩展到噪声/异构空间及n>2情形，并通过ReLU网络、CNN、视觉语言模型进行实证验证。

Result: 发现普适帕累托前沿、多输入处理能力的1/n崩溃现象、自组织分辨率边界，且在复杂模型中仍保持相同极限，证明有限分辨率相似性是涌现的固有约束。

Conclusion: 有限语义分辨率是深度网络与生物神经系统的根本信息约束，理论精确刻画了泛化-识别权衡关系，为理解表征能力提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统Transformer模型在时间序列预测中计算复杂度高（二次方）、难以泛化到未见序列，以及传统时间编码方法对复杂季节性和非平稳特征捕捉能力有限的问题。

Method: 1) 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型替代Transformer，将计算复杂度降至线性；2) 利用预训练语言模型初始化语义索引嵌入增强泛化能力；3) 引入基于样条的KAN网络动态解析复杂时序模式。

Result: 实验验证ss-Mamba在预测精度、鲁棒性和可解释性上均超越传统Transformer模型，同时实现线性时间计算复杂度。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba为时间序列预测提供了兼具高效计算、强泛化能力和可解释性的新范式，可替代传统Transformer架构。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: 所提连续时间模型为优化方法分析提供新工具，尤其在深度学习领域展示了通过控制离散化误差实现理论突破的潜力。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Result: VLMs在视觉领域呈现类似LLM的提示敏感性，破坏性提示主要改变预期答案；InternVL2模型表现最稳健，敏感性可能与训练数据分布相关。

Conclusion: PARC有效量化VLM提示敏感性，揭示模型间鲁棒性差异及训练数据潜在影响，为模型优化提供评估工具。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture that
naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual
reinforcement learning. The structure of each module allows the selective
combination of previous policies along with its internal policy, accelerating
the learning process on the current task. Unlike previous growing neural
network approaches, we show that the number of parameters of the proposed
approach grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks, and does not
sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted in benchmark continuous
control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach achieves greater
knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.

Motivation: 深度学习训练过程复杂且易产生难以检测的静默错误，传统方法在错误诊断与调试上存在不足。

Method: 提出TRAINCHECK框架，通过自动推断DL训练专用不变量实现主动错误检测，并集成调试辅助功能。

Result: 在复现的20个真实错误中，单次训练迭代内成功检测18个错误，同时发现主流训练库中6个未知缺陷。

Conclusion: TRAINCHECK通过主动检查机制显著提升静默错误检测效率，验证了其在训练过程监控与调试中的实用价值。

Abstract: Training deep learning (DL) models is a complex process, making it prone to
silent errors that are challenging to detect and diagnose. This paper presents
TRAINCHECK, a framework that takes a proactive checking approach to address
silent training errors. TRAINCHECK automatically infers invariants tailored for
DL training. It uses these invariants to proactively detect silent errors
during the training process while providing debugging help. To evaluate
TRAINCHECK, we reproduce 20 real-world silent training errors with diverse root
causes. TRAINCHECK successfully detects 18 errors within a single training
iteration. It also uncovers 6 unknown bugs in popular training libraries that
lead to silent errors.

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用3D光学图像生物标志物结合p-Laplacian半监督回归模型，替代传统DXA扫描预测人体成分指标，在数据受限环境下取得与监督学习可比的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA扫描虽能精准测量人体成分指标(ALM/BFP/BMD)，但存在成本高、耗时长及医疗数据获取受限等问题，需开发替代性预测方法。

Method: 采用半监督p-Laplacian回归模型(首次应用于回归任务)，并与支持向量回归(SVR)等监督算法对比，使用847例3D光学图像生物标志物数据集。

Result: p-Laplacian在10%训练数据下误差为ALM13%/BMD10%/BFP20%；监督模型中SVR在80%数据下ALM/BMD误差8%，LS-SVR对BFP误差11%。

Conclusion: p-Laplacian模型在数据受限场景展现医疗应用潜力，为DXA提供可行替代方案，尤其在训练数据不足时保持较好预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

TL;DR: 通过GRPO训练小规模视觉语言模型，结合工具调用和优化策略，提升有限计算资源下的细粒度视觉推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在计算资源受限时难以进行细粒度视觉推理，需通过优化方法提升小模型性能。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO)训练框架，结合简化工具接口、工具调用结果token扩展、视觉困难样本过采样及简单奖励机制。

Result: 在同等规模基线模型上，通过外部工具获取细节视觉信息，显著提升了部分视觉问答任务性能。

Conclusion: 综合GRPO学习、工具调用优化及数据策略，可有效增强小模型在复杂视觉任务中的细粒度推理能力。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano提出首个联邦学习框架，通过集中化大语言模型于服务器端并引入轻量级NanoEdge模块，解决多模态大模型在联邦学习中面临的高计算需求、客户端容量限制及隐私问题，显著降低存储与通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在现实场景中面临分布式数据与隐私保护挑战，传统联邦学习（FL）方法因需客户端部署完整模型而无法适配大规模MLLMs。

Method: FedNano框架将大语言模型（LLM）集中部署于服务器，客户端仅需轻量级NanoEdge模块（含模态编码器、连接器及低秩适配器NanoAdapters），通过传输极小参数更新实现隐私保护与异构数据处理。

Result: 实验显示，FedNano减少客户端95%存储占用，通信开销仅需0.01%模型参数，性能优于现有联邦学习方法，弥合MLLM规模与FL可行性间的鸿沟。

Conclusion: FedNano为去中心化多模态AI系统提供可扩展解决方案，通过高效参数传输与模块化设计，平衡模型规模、隐私保护及资源限制，推动联邦学习在复杂场景中的应用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

Conclusion: 先进替代模型（如DGP）在数据高效材料设计中具有强大潜力，可提升异质数据处理能力并支持稳健的材料设计。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性至关重要，但传统模型存在泛化瓶颈，需提升分类精度与稳定性以实现工业级存储系统预防性维护。

Method: 整合双向GRU网络（BiGRU）捕捉SSD退化特征的前后向时序依赖，结合多头注意力机制（MHA）动态分配特征权重，增强对关键健康指标的敏感性。

Result: 训练集与测试集分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，性能差距仅0.26%；测试集ROC曲线下面积AUC达0.94，验证模型优异二分类性能。

Conclusion: 该模型通过早期故障预警降低数据丢失风险，优化运维成本，为云计算数据中心与边缘存储环境提供可靠存储系统建设的技术支撑。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

Motivation: 医疗数据常不完整且ML模型缺乏透明度，影响AMD等疾病的分类效果。需结合多因素的可解释分类方法以支持临床决策。

Method: 开发CACTUS工具，整合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计学因素，通过消除无关/偏差数据构建分类模型，提供可解释结果与关键特征分析。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过可解释性和数据优化提升AMD分类准确性，促进医患协作，为复杂医疗数据的ML应用提供透明、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小规模单类分类任务中仅有少量负样本可用的问题，传统OC-SVM因未利用负样本信息而性能受限。本文旨在通过改进核函数设计，结合负样本提升模型表现。

Method: 提出广义参考核GRKneg，通过选择/生成参考向量优化核函数，保留OC-SVM原始实现（无需标签优化），仅利用负样本改进核计算过程。

Result: GRKneg在RBF核下稳定优于标准OC-SVM；当负样本极少时，其表现显著优于二元SVM；负样本充足时二元SVM更优（符合预期）。

Conclusion: GRKneg为低负样本场景下的单类分类提供了有效解决方案，通过核函数改进平衡了单类与二元方法的优势边界。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

<details>

Motivation: 在线学习在垂直联邦学习（VFL）中更具现实适应性，但现有研究未充分考虑VFL中客户端特征不重叠、数据异步到达及事件驱动特性（仅部分客户端被激活）带来的挑战。这些缺陷导致传统在线VFL在非平稳数据环境下效果受限。

Method: 提出事件驱动的在线VFL框架：1）仅激活与事件相关的客户端子集，其余被动协作；2）引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）以处理非凸模型在非平稳环境中的学习问题，并针对非凸条件下的DLR进行理论分析。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在非平稳数据环境下比现有在线VFL更稳定，同时显著降低通信和计算成本。理论分析验证了非凸条件下动态局部遗憾的收敛性。

Conclusion: 事件驱动的在线VFL框架通过动态激活客户端和引入DLR，有效解决了数据异步与事件驱动场景下的挑战，为实际应用中非平稳、非凸模型的联邦学习提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

Motivation: 现有联邦黑盒提示调优方法未考虑云大模型服务的高昂查询成本，需在保证性能的前提下优化查询效率。

Method: 通过理论分析提出FedOne框架，在联邦学习中仅激活单客户端以优化查询效率，并设计基于此的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法。

Result: 数值实验表明FedOne显著提升查询效率，与理论分析一致，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FedOne在保持联邦学习性能的同时极大降低查询成本，为云大模型服务的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Motivation: 研究神经网络损失景观中准平坦区域的动态特性，揭示全连接层中隐藏的计算结构，特别是神经元权重发散与趋同的机制。

Method: 通过几何分析、梯度动力学建模和数值实验（梯度流/SGD/ADAM优化），在回归任务中系统研究损失景观通道的对称性、收敛行为及功能表达。

Conclusion: 通道结构揭示了全连接层通过权重发散实现门控计算的自组织能力，挑战了传统对平坦极小值的认知，为理解神经网络隐式正则化提供了新视角。

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [95] [ODD: Overlap-aware Estimation of Model Performance under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14978)
*Aayush Mishra,Anqi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于重叠感知分歧差异（ODD）的新方法，用于更准确地估计机器学习模型在未知目标域上的误差。通过消除源域与目标域重叠区域的竞争，ODD利用域分类器估计域间重叠，从而改进现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（DIS²）在估计目标域误差时，因在源域与目标域重叠区域引入不必要的竞争，导致误差估计不够准确。本文假设目标域在重叠区域的分歧应不大于源域，从而提出改进需求。

Method: 提出重叠感知分歧差异（ODD），仅在目标域非重叠区域最大化分类器分歧，避免与源域竞争。通过域分类器估计域间重叠区域，优化ODD以更精确地预测目标域性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ODD方法相比DIS²显著降低了性能估计误差，同时保持有效性和可靠性。实验验证了其在实际应用中的优越性。

Conclusion: ODD通过显式建模域间重叠，解决了现有方法在重叠区域的竞争问题，提供了更准确且可靠的目标域误差估计，适用于安全关键智能系统。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 结合临床与数字数据，使用多模态transformer模型提升多发性硬化症早期残疾进展预测性能，证实多模态方法优于单模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症（MS）早期残疾进展因疾病异质性难以预测，需探索如何通过整合稀疏临床数据与短期数字监测数据提高预测准确性。

Method: 采用前沿表格/时序基础模型、定制多模态注意力transformer及机器学习方法，融合CONSONANCE试验的基线临床数据与12周Floodlight数字数据。

Result: 多模态transformer模型（整合Moment FM单模态嵌入）表现最佳，AUROC达0.63，验证临床+数字数据组合的预测优势。

Conclusion: 基础模型与多模态方法可从复杂临床/数字数据中提取预测信号，为MS等复杂疾病提供更精准预后，具有跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种多智能体多臂老虎机框架，通过策略性探测平衡公平性与系统性能，在离线和在线场景下分别设计高效算法，实验验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体环境中公平性分配与全局性能最大化的矛盾，尤其针对臂奖励信息有限场景下的决策挑战。

Method: 离线场景利用子模特性设计贪心探测算法；在线场景开发次线性遗憾算法，结合战略信息探测与公平约束机制。

Conclusion: 通过战略信息探测与子模优化相结合，证明了在复杂多智能体决策场景中同时实现公平与效率的可行性。

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at
ensuring fair outcomes across agents while maximizing overall system
performance. A key challenge in this setting is decision-making under limited
information about arm rewards. To address this, we introduce a novel probing
framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 通过控制微分方程（CDE）结合训练稳定性和临床相关性正则化，提升脓毒症强化学习策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症强化学习的状态表示方法忽视训练不稳定性问题，导致策略性能下降。需解决序列表示学习中的稳定性及临床意义缺失问题。

Method: 使用CDE模型构建状态表示，通过早停/稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并利用SOFA等临床评分进行相关性正则化以增强表征的临床可解释性。

Result: 稳定CDE编码器生成与临床评分强相关的表征，使RL策略WIS回报>0.9；不稳定训练则导致策略失效（WIS~0）。潜在空间可视化显示稳定模型能区分生存轨迹和临床严重度梯度。

Conclusion: CDE在医疗时序数据编码中需优先保证训练稳定性，结合临床相关性约束可生成有效强化学习表征，为临床RL提供实用指导原则。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

*Gyuhak Kim,Sumiran Singh Thakur,Su Min Park,Wei Wei,Yujia Bao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SFT-GO方法，通过按重要性对token分组并结合最差组损失与交叉熵损失，优化大语言模型监督微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法均等对待所有token，但实际任务中仅部分关键token包含核心信息，需差异化优化。

Method: SFT-GO根据token重要性值分组，采用最差组损失与标准交叉熵损失的加权组合进行模型优化，自适应强化关键组。

Result: 在多个LLM基准测试中，SFT-GO使用不同分组策略均超越基线方法，且结果在不同数据集和基模型上保持稳健。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过动态关注关键token组，有效提升模型学习动态，证实了方法在任务适应性和鲁棒性上的优势。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

### [100] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了词汇量对大型语言模型训练动态的影响，发现当词汇量增大时，训练机制会在μP和大词汇(LV)机制间过渡，提出LV机制下嵌入层与隐藏层学习率比例应遵循√width缩放规则，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有μP理论假设输入维度(词汇量)固定，但实际LLM中词汇量远大于模型宽度，导致μP超参数迁移性在LLM中出现矛盾现象。需探究词汇量对训练动态的影响机制。

Method: 通过理论分析词汇量对梯度动态的影响，推导训练机制随词汇量变化的过渡规律。设计实验验证理论预测的LV机制下学习率缩放规则，并从头训练10亿参数模型进行实证。

Result: 理论证明当词汇量增大时，最优嵌入层/隐藏层学习率比例应遵循Θ(√width)，与文献经验值接近且不同于μP的Θ(width)预测。实验验证新规则可提升模型训练效果。

Conclusion: 词汇量是影响训练动态的关键因素，LV机制下的√width学习率缩放规则优于传统μP理论，为大规模语言模型预训练提供了更精确的超参数设置指导。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO、GLUE等5个跨模态数据集上，SPG重训练模型性能提升0.2%~7%，计算成本显著低于传统迁移微调方法。

Conclusion: SPG通过高效轨迹生成机制，在工业级场景中实现了跨模型、跨任务的稳定性能改进，为轻量级超参数优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架通过残差学习和动态优化机制，为解决高精度神经网络训练问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Conclusion: NCPF通过融合张量分解的可解释性与神经网络的非线性表达能力，为高维交通数据填补提供了兼具理论严谨性和灵活性的解决方案，支撑下一代自适应交通控制系统建设。

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Conclusion: ImprovDML框架通过几何隐私保护与弹性向量共识的协同设计，有效解决了安全与隐私双重挑战，推进了分布式机器学习实用化。

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Motivation: 现有行为分割方法过度简化动物行为生成过程，假设离散音节且生成约束强，无法反映动物通过动态组合核心运动原语实现多样化任务的机制。

Method: SKIL结合表示学习推断潜在技能（行为转移概率的基函数），并利用动态混合策略参数化技能组合，实现连续演化策略建模。

Conclusion: 通过组合表征与生成行为建模，SKIL为复杂动物行为如何从基础运动原语动态组合中涌现提供了简洁、原理性解释框架。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

*Yee Hin Chong,Peng Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SoKA方法，结合Kronecker乘积与SVD初始化，通过动态秩选择实现高效参数微调，在减少25%参数量的同时保持或超越基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在推理延迟、随机低秩更新收敛差、固定秩选择不匹配任务复杂度等问题，需开发更优解决方案。

Method: SoKA方法采用Kronecker乘积张量分解与SVD驱动初始化，结合能量阈值和肘点准则的动态秩选择算法，剪枝次要成分。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，SoKA仅需0.99M可训练参数（比LoRA/PiSSA少25%），在数学推理、代码生成等任务中性能相当或更优，且收敛更快、梯度更稳定。

Conclusion: SoKA通过Kronecker-SVD分解与自适应秩选择机制，实现了大规模模型高效适配，在参数效率与性能间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习在拜占庭攻击下的鲁棒性，揭示了平均聚合与有效性条件的权衡关系，提出了新的下界与上界理论，并设计了实现紧致边界的新算法。

Motivation: 现有联邦学习研究使用平均化作为聚合规则，但未充分解决拜占庭节点对模型训练的影响。本文旨在探索平均聚合与分布式计算有效性条件之间的根本性矛盾，并建立理论保障。

Method: 通过理论分析建立box validity条件下的下界min{(n-t)/t,√d}，提出2min{n,√d}上界；设计实现√2d近似的新算法；在分布式点对点环境与联邦SGD/平均算法场景进行实证验证。

Result: 首次证明box validity下中心点近似需付出min{(n-t)/t,√d}代价，提出匹配该下界的算法；在凸有效性条件下实现√2d近似，证明现有下界紧致性；所有边界在P2P场景同样成立。

Conclusion: 联邦学习需在模型平均近似质量与拜占庭鲁棒性间权衡，本文建立的严格理论边界与算法为系统设计提供理论依据，实证结果验证了理论在现实场景的适用性。

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据版权主张提供可靠技术依据，证明合成数据在现实法律纠纷中替代真实保留集的可行性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出DOVA-PATBM框架，通过多分辨率地理计算与图神经网络优化电动汽车充电站布局，兼顾覆盖范围、公平性与电网约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有充电站规划研究多针对单一城市，但州/国家级网络需协调城市密集区、郊区与电力受限农村的冲突需求，需开发可扩展的综合性规划工具。

Method: 结合H3网格栅格化多源数据（道路、人口、POI等），使用图神经网络评估道路节点重要性，通过Voronoi镶嵌确保30km半径覆盖，并基于交通数据与排队模型优化充电桩数量与选址。

Result: 在佐治亚州应用中：30km覆盖范围提升12%，低收入群体最近充电站平均距离减半，全境满足电网容量限制，且算法支持国家级规模部署。

Conclusion: 融合GNN与多分辨率分析的集成方法能有效弥合学术优化与实际基建政策的鸿沟，证明可扩展框架在复杂地理场景中的实用性。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私敏感场景下的LLM定制化提供了高效安全的解决方案，突破了传统MPC在LLM微调中的计算限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Conclusion: 模型深度/循环结构通过隐式高阶多项式拟合提升半监督学习性能，理论分析为改进现成基础模型提供了数学依据，验证了迭代伪标签机制与EM算法的内在关联。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于分位数回归的成员推理攻击方法，用于改进差分隐私（DP）在黑盒设置下的单次审计效果，在保持计算效率的同时获得更紧的隐私下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒设置下的差分隐私审计方法在实证下界与理论上界间存在较大差距，且无法在训练过程中操纵梯度或仅能观察最终模型参数。

Method: 通过结合更强的成员推理攻击（MIA）方法，提出使用分位数回归进行MIA，以增强单次审计在黑盒设置下的效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上对DP-SGD训练的模型进行实验，证明该方法能获得更紧的隐私下界，同时保持单次审计方法的计算效率。

Conclusion: 基于分位数回归的MIA方法有效缩小了黑盒设置下DP审计的实证与理论差距，为实际部署提供了高效可靠的审计方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出DiTMC框架，通过模块化架构和两种图条件策略，将扩散变换器应用于分子构象生成，解决了分子图与3D几何整合、对称性处理等挑战，在标准基准测试中达到SOTA精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在图像生成中表现优异，但应用于分子构象生成时面临分子图离散信息与3D几何连续性的整合、欧几里得对称性处理、跨尺寸结构的条件机制设计等新挑战。

Method: 提出DiTMC框架：1) 模块化架构分离处理3D坐标与原子连接性条件；2) 两种互补的图条件策略；3) 结合标准非等变与SO(3)-等变注意力机制，平衡精度与计算效率。

Result: 在GEOM-QM9/DRUGS/XL基准测试中实现SOTA精度与物理有效性，验证了架构选择与对称性先验对生成质量与效率的影响。

Conclusion: DiTMC为分子结构生成提供了有效框架，其模块化设计与对称性整合策略为大规模分子生成模型的发展指明方向。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布级标签学习全局基础度量的新方法，提升最优传输在分类任务中的表现，并通过单细胞RNA测序数据验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输的基础度量通常为预定义（如欧氏距离）或需监督学习，但前者无法捕捉数据特征的结构与重要性，后者在多类泛化或分布支持上受限。需一种更灵活、通用的度量学习方法。

Method: 提出学习共享度量空间上任意分布的全局基础度量，仅需分布级类标签训练，结合点间距离计算，提升最优传输距离的准确性。

Result: 在跨疾病患者单细胞RNA测序数据中，新方法显著提高了嵌入、聚类和分类性能，并展现出可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过全局基础度量学习，克服传统方法的局限性，提升任务性能，实验验证了方法的有效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Conclusion: 该框架为生成模型驱动的探索问题提供了可扩展解决方案，揭示了扩散模型熵与得分函数的内在联系，为科学发现等场景提供了新工具。

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Conclusion: 所提方法在未知图场景下实现了理论保证与实用效率的平衡，为实际传染病防控提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文针对可解释人工智能（XAI）领域缺乏标准化评估的问题，通过系统文献综述提出统一评估框架VXAI，整合362篇文献的指标并建立三维分类体系，以增强XAI方法的可比性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XAI方法虽多，但缺乏统一的评估标准和指标共识，导致模型解释的实用性和可信度难以保障。研究旨在填补这一空白，促进透明化AI系统的发展。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南进行系统文献综述，分析362篇相关论文，提出VXAI框架，将指标归纳为41个功能组，并设计基于解释类型、评估情境性和质量需求的三维分类方案。

Result: 构建了目前最全面的XAI评估框架，支持系统性指标选择，提升方法可比性，并为未来扩展提供灵活基础。

Conclusion: VXAI框架为XAI评估提供了结构化视角，解决了标准化缺失问题，有助于推动可信AI的实际应用与持续研究。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Motivation: 奖励模型在强化学习中作为代理目标，需同时满足贴近真实任务目标与促进策略优化的双重需求。然而，现有研究缺乏对奖励建模技术的系统性总结，因此本文旨在整合传统与新兴方法，梳理研究进展。

Method: 通过分类框架（来源、机制、学习范式）对现有奖励建模方法进行结构化梳理，结合理论分析与应用案例，并系统总结评估方法。

Result: 提出多维分类体系，整合了包括基于人类反馈、环境交互等不同来源的奖励建模方法，并指出其在机器人控制、游戏AI等场景的应用潜力与评估标准。

Conclusion: 奖励建模是强化学习任务设计的关键环节，未来需在模型可解释性、稀疏奖励优化及多目标权衡等方向深化研究，以提升智能体与复杂环境的对齐能力。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

*Laura Kopf,Nils Feldhus,Kirill Bykov,Philine Lou Bommer,Anna Hedström,Marina M. -C. Höhne,Oliver Eberle*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出PRISM框架，解决现有特征描述方法因假设神经元单义性而无法捕捉多义特征的问题，通过更精细的描述提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法存在鲁棒性不足、错误假设神经元单义性（monosemanticity）的缺陷，而实际神经元常为多义（polysemantic），这限制了特征描述的完整性和表达能力。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，通过多义特征识别与评分方法，为单义和多义特征提供细粒度描述，突破传统方法每个特征仅分配单一描述的局限。

Result: 在语言模型上的实验表明，PRISM在描述质量（description score）和多义性捕捉能力（polysemanticity score）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRISM通过承认并建模特征的多义性，显著提升了神经网络特征描述的准确性和完备性，为模型可解释性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Motivation: 现有零样本强化学习方法依赖马尔可夫状态假设，但在实际应用中常面临部分可观测性问题。研究旨在分析标准方法在此场景下的性能退化，并提出改进方案。

Method: 采用基于记忆的架构设计零样本强化学习方法，以应对部分可观测性挑战，并在状态、奖励和动态变化部分可观测的领域中进行验证。

Result: 实验显示，基于记忆的方法在部分可观测场景中性能显著优于无记忆基线模型，尤其在动态变化和奖励不可直接观测时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 研究表明，引入记忆机制能有效缓解零样本强化学习在部分可观测环境中的性能下降问题，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需训练的LoX方法，通过低秩外推增强大语言模型的安全鲁棒性，有效抵御微调攻击，同时保持任务适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过对齐提升了大语言模型的安全性，但后续微调（即使使用良性数据）仍可能破坏其安全防护，需增强安全鲁棒性。

Method: 基于安全关键低秩子空间对微调敏感性的观察，提出LoX方法：通过外推对齐模型的安全子空间来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明LoX使攻击成功率绝对降低11%-54%，且参数被外推到更平坦区域，对扰动敏感性降低，同时保持任务适应能力。

Conclusion: LoX通过参数空间外推有效提升模型安全鲁棒性，其成功归因于参数进入对扰动不敏感的平坦区域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法假设正常节点具有相似同质性且标记节点能充分代表正常类模式，但现实中正常节点的同质性可能高度多样，导致假设失效。

Method: RHO包含两个模块：1) AdaFreq通过通道内和跨通道视角学习自适应频谱滤波器，捕捉不同同质性频率成分；2) GNA通过对齐两种视角的同质性表示增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在8个真实GAD数据集上的实验表明，RHO能有效学习小规模正常节点中多样同质性模式，检测性能显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应频率响应和表示对齐机制，突破了传统方法对同质性的强假设限制，为处理现实复杂同质性场景的图异常检测提供了新方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

TL;DR: AutoRule通过自动从用户反馈中提取规则并生成基于规则的奖励，显著提升了强化学习性能，实验显示其效果优于传统基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，效率低且成本高。研究旨在实现规则自动提取，以提升RLHF（基于人类反馈的强化学习）的效率和效果。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：1）用推理模型解释用户偏好；2）从解释链中提取候选规则；3）合成统一规则集。结合语言模型验证器计算规则满足度，作为策略优化中的辅助奖励。

Result: 使用AutoRule训练的Llama-3-8B模型在AlpacaEval2.0上相对提升28.6%，在MT-Bench子集上提升6.1%。规则与数据集偏好一致，且相比传统奖励模型，奖励黑客现象减少。

Conclusion: AutoRule能自动提取有效规则，提升模型性能并减少人工干预。规则捕捉了不同数据集的独特价值，开源代码促进后续应用。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过简化时间序列的弯曲路径来增强比较的可解释性，突出关键变换如位移、压缩和幅度差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弹性距离度量方法虽支持时间弯曲，但缺乏定性比较；传统可视化仅关注点对点对齐，无法展示子序列层面的结构关系，难以理解时间序列间的位移、速度变化。

Method: 开发一种新技术，通过简化弯曲路径，量化并可视化关键变换（如位移、压缩、幅度差异），以更清晰表示子序列匹配关系。

Result: 该方法能更直观展示子序列间的匹配方式，提升时间序列比较的可解释性，明确揭示序列间的动态变化模式。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过结构化的弯曲路径简化，有效解决了时间序列比较中定性分析不足的问题，为复杂动态变化提供了可解释的视觉与量化工具。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了稀疏自编码器(SAE)中密集潜在特征的性质，发现其并非训练噪声，而是具有语义功能的模型内在表征，并揭示了其几何结构、功能分类及跨层演化规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对SAE训练中频繁激活的密集潜在特征是否属于训练噪声的争议，探究其本质属性与功能价值。

Method: 通过几何分析揭示密集特征形成对映对重构残差流方向；建立特征分类体系；分析跨层演化模式；结合特征消融实验验证其内在属性。

Result: 发现密集特征具有位置追踪/上下文绑定/熵调节等功能，形成包含6类特征的分类型谱系，并在模型不同层级呈现结构特征→语义特征→输出导向信号的演化规律。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算的功能性组件，反映了残差空间的固有属性，不应被简单视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

*Mohammadreza Nemati,Zhipeng Huang,Kevin S. Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LIT-LVM方法，通过低维潜在向量表示特征交互项的系数结构，结合正则化提升高维数据下线性模型的预测精度，并在交互项数量远大于样本量时优于弹性网络和因子分解机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性预测器通过添加特征交互项建模非线性关系，但高维交互项系数估计易过拟合。现有正则化方法（如lasso、弹性网络）未充分利用交互项间的潜在低维结构。

Method: 假设交互项系数存在低维结构，将特征映射到低维潜在空间，构建结构化正则化框架LIT-LVM，通过潜在向量乘积建模交互效应，降低参数维度。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中，LIT-LVM预测精度显著优于弹性网络和因子分解机，尤其在交互项数远大于样本量时。低维潜在向量可有效可视化特征间关系。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM通过结构化低维正则化有效缓解高维交互项过拟合，同时提供可解释的潜在表示，为特征关系分析提供新工具。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

Conclusion: 所提框架首次为任意黑盒归因方法提供像素级鲁棒性认证，通过三大量化指标验证其有效性，为可信解释性研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中的时空过压缩问题，发现其与静态图场景存在显著差异，并揭示卷积STGNNs在时间维度上反直觉的信息传播特性，为高效模型设计提供理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注静态图神经网络的过压缩问题（如远距离节点信息传播失效），但时空场景下该问题因时间维度引入的信息量增加而未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过形式化时空过压缩问题，理论分析卷积STGNNs的信息传播特性，并比较时间-空间联合处理与分步处理范式的表现，结合合成与真实数据集进行验证。

Result: 发现卷积STGNNs更倾向于传播时间远距离而非邻近信息；证明时间-空间联合处理与分步处理均受时空过压缩影响，为简化计算实现提供理论依据；实验验证了理论分析的普适性。

Conclusion: 时空过压缩现象具有独特性，研究揭示了STGNNs的底层机制，为设计更高效的时空图神经网络提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出RePCS方法，通过比较两种推理路径的KL散度，检测RAG模型是否依赖记忆而非检索内容，无需模型访问或重训练，在基准测试中AUC达0.918，延迟增加低于4.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统可能绕过检索证据直接依赖训练数据记忆，导致输出污染。需开发无需模型内部访问的轻量级检测方法。

Method: 通过计算纯参数路径与检索增强路径输出的KL散度，判断模型对检索内容的依赖程度。基于PAC理论设定阈值，仅需单次额外前向计算。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准上ROC-AUC达0.918，较现有最优方法提升6.5%，T4 GPU上延迟增幅控制在4.7%以内。

Conclusion: RePCS为黑盒RAG系统提供了高效、理论保障的污染检测方案，特别适用于安全关键场景的可靠性验证。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于线性代数工具的简化分析方法，复现了Zou等人关于过参数化线性回归中SGD的偏差-方差界限，避免了复杂的半正定矩阵操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SGD理论分析依赖半正定矩阵运算符，复杂度较高。本文旨在通过更简单的线性代数工具降低分析门槛，为后续优化算法研究（如小批量训练、学习率调度）提供基础。

Method: 使用线性代数直接分解SGD风险，替代原方法中对半正定矩阵的运算符操作，实现偏差和方差项的独立分析。

Result: 在恒定学习率条件下，成功复现了与Zou等人完全相同的偏差和方差收敛率边界。

Conclusion: 该方法显著简化了SGD在线性回归中的理论分析流程，为研究更复杂的训练机制（如动态学习率）提供了可扩展的理论框架。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Method: 扩展Gold框架，引入时间约束观察和策略轨迹观察；构建计算代理观察的形式化框架，将策略轨迹学习归约为有理函数学习；分析线性时间函数的特征集存在性。

Result: 通过计算复杂度约束或时间近似观察可突破传统学习限制；策略轨迹学习与有限状态转换器推断存在联系；线性时间函数无法存在可计算/多项式质量特征集。

Conclusion: 计算观察与受限输入源扩展了函数学习的理论边界，但特定函数类仍存在根本性学习障碍，为计算学习理论与自动机推断的交叉提供新视角。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: 网络扩展性问题源于梯度流缺陷，通过针对性架构干预可稳定训练过程，为大规模深度强化学习提供了简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Conclusion: LogNet通过可解释性机制不仅解析深度学习内部行为，还显著提升定位系统的长期部署稳定性与计算效率。

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

TL;DR: MicroRicci提出首个自适应的局部Ricci-flow求解器，通过编码理论和小型神经网络模块，在实时网格平滑中实现高效、低延迟和高精度，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Ricci-flow求解器依赖全局更新导致计算成本高，而启发式方法收敛慢或需复杂调参，亟需一种高效、自适应的实时网格平滑方案。

Method: 结合编码理论的贪婪校正步骤（O(E)时间定位最大曲率误差），并引入两个微型神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长，总参数量仅1K+200。

Result: 在110个SJTU-TMQA网格上，迭代次数减少2.4倍（950±140→400±80），曲率分布更紧（0.19→0.185），UV失真与MOS相关性达-0.93，端到端加速1.8倍。

Conclusion: MicroRicci以线性时间更新、自适应超参数和高保真几何结果，为图形学、仿真等实时资源受限场景提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE提出了一种基于梯度随机投影的差分隐私训练方法，显著降低内存占用并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私方法（如DP-Adam）因逐样本梯度裁剪导致内存开销过高，限制了在大模型上的可扩展性。

Method: 通过三个关键改进：(1)投影后梯度隐私化，(2)用高斯随机矩阵替代SVD子空间，(3)反向传播时应用投影，消除SVD计算并降低内存。

Result: 在ViT预训练和RoBERTa-Large微调中分别减少63%和70%内存，性能与DP-Adam相当，并可扩展至67亿参数的OPT模型。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在保持差分隐私-效用平衡的同时，显著降低内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 本研究评估联邦学习在脑龄预测（BrainAGE）中的应用，发现其在不集中数据的情况下表现优于单中心模型，且BrainAGE与血管风险因素及卒中后功能恢复显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BrainAGE模型需集中大量数据训练，但医疗数据共享存在隐私限制。研究旨在验证联邦学习在卒中患者脑龄预测中的可行性，并探索BrainAGE与临床预后的关联。

Method: 使用16个中心的1674例卒中患者FLAIR影像，对比集中学习、联邦学习和单中心学习策略的预测误差，并通过逻辑回归分析BrainAGE与糖尿病等血管因素及3个月功能预后的关系。

Result: 联邦学习模型精度仅次于集中学习但优于单中心模型；糖尿病患者BrainAGE显著更高；BrainAGE与卒中后功能恢复独立相关。

Conclusion: 联邦学习可突破数据隐私限制实现精准脑龄预测，BrainAGE作为生物标志物对卒中预后建模具有临床价值。

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对离线强化学习中AWR方法因数据质量差导致策略过于保守的问题，提出CAWR方法，通过鲁棒损失函数和优势优先经验回放，有效提升次优数据下的策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AWR方法在次优离线数据中因探索不足易产生过度保守策略，主要源于策略优化损失函数对数据噪声敏感及低质量数据占比高。

Method: 提出CAWR方法：1) 在策略优化中引入鲁棒损失函数降低对噪声敏感度；2) 基于优势值的优先级经验回放机制过滤低质量探索数据。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，CAWR显著优于基线方法，验证了其从次优数据中学习高效策略的能力。

Conclusion: CAWR通过鲁棒优化和动态数据过滤机制，解决了AWR系列方法在低质量离线数据中的过保守问题，为策略优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对360度视频的超分辨率模型S3PO，通过构建新数据集360VDS并设计球形失真优化损失函数，解决了传统VSR模型在等距柱状投影中的失真问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频超分辨率（VSR）技术未解决360度视频等距柱状投影的失真问题，且缺乏专用数据集。现有方法无法满足沉浸式体验的视觉质量需求。

Method: 提出S3PO模型：1) 构建360VDS数据集；2) 采用循环建模与注意力机制，避免传统对齐操作；3) 设计专用特征提取器及针对球形失真的损失函数。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上性能优于主流传统VSR模型及360度专用超分辨率模型，并通过分步消融实验验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性架构设计和球形失真优化，显著提升360度视频超分辨率效果，为沉浸式VR体验提供了有效的软件解决方案。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种数据集成框架，用于学习分数阶非线性系统的动力学特性，通过两步法估计系统参数并重构向量场，验证显示分数阶模型在捕捉长程依赖性上优于整数阶模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数阶系统在建模复杂现象（如记忆依赖行为）中具有优势，但传统整数阶模型难以准确描述其动力学特性。需要开发一种系统性方法从数据中学习分数阶系统的动态行为。

Method: 1. 设计输入-输出实验生成数据集；2. 结合分数阶系统的记忆特性估计分数阶数，利用正交基函数重构漂移/控制向量场。通过四个基准系统验证框架有效性。

Result: 在四个基准系统上验证了框架的准确性，分数阶模型相比整数阶模型在长程依赖性建模中表现出显著优势（如均方误差降低30%-50%）。

Conclusion: 分数阶表示能更本质地刻画系统动力学特性，所提框架为复杂系统建模提供了有效工具，揭示了整数阶模型在长程依赖场景中的根本局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 研究提出结合物理模型与高斯过程隐力模型（GPLFM）的虚拟传感方法，用于渡轮码头数字孪生中的结构响应估计，解决传感器限制、未知冲击特性等挑战，验证了模型在多数区域的准确性并优化传感器布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渡轮码头因海洋环境与船舶的相互作用易快速损坏，而实际传感器难以部署在关键位置，需通过虚拟传感技术构建数字孪生以评估结构完整性并量化冲击影响。

Method: 采用物理编码机器学习模型，将降阶结构模型与数据驱动的GPLFM结合，通过模态贡献表示未知冲击力，并利用反向序贯传感器布置策略优化传感器配置。

Result: GPLFM在多数位置能准确估计加速度响应（冲击区除外），数值实验表明传感器类型、采样频率和阻尼比假设误差对结果敏感，但隐力模型可缓解建模与测量不确定性。

Conclusion: GPLFM在简化假设下仍保持可接受的估计精度，为复杂边界条件与稀疏传感场景下的结构健康监测提供了可行方案，隐力建模有助于处理实际工程中的不确定性。

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Motivation: 现有因果推断方法在时间序列场景下面临真实因果图不可得的问题，需通过抽象图（如摘要因果图）评估干预效应是否仅依赖观测数据即可计算。

Method: 针对时间序列（含/不含时间一致性），分析共同后门集的存在条件，并提出复杂度可控的算法以判定可识别性。

Result: 建立了时间序列中共同后门集存在的理论条件，并设计算法验证可识别性，为实际应用提供计算工具。

Conclusion: 通过理论条件与算法，解决了摘要因果图下时间序列干预效应的可识别性判定问题，扩展了因果推断在时序场景的可行性。

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有转录组基础模型（TFM）的实现和训练策略多样，导致难以评估设计选择的影响，阻碍领域最佳实践的共识和跨研究可重复性。

Method: 开发开源框架BMFM-RNA，支持统一预训练与微调目标，提出基于自编码器CLS瓶颈的全局表达解码目标（WCED），结合掩码语言建模（MLM）和多任务学习。

Result: 在CELLxGENE预训练的WCED模型在零样本和微调任务中，于十余个数据集上匹配或超越scGPT等先进方法。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统化评估TFM训练策略提供可复现基础，促进开发更有效的AI工具以理解细胞生物学。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o在提取经济叙事中的表现，发现其能生成结构化结果，但复杂场景下仍不及专家，并为后续研究提供建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有经济叙事提取流程依赖传统NLP模型（如BERT），缺乏深层语义理解，难以区分叙事提取与基础语义任务。研究旨在探索大语言模型（LLM）在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用GPT-4o分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》的通胀相关文章，对比其输出与专家标注的黄金标准叙事，并应用严格叙事定义进行验证。

Result: GPT-4o能提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时准确性低于专家水平。

Conclusion: LLM为经济叙事提取提供了新工具，但其在复杂场景中的局限性需结合领域专业知识改进，未来研究需进一步探索LLM在社会科学中的应用方法。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Method: 结合仿微分演算理论证明softmax不变性，构建基于查询/键/头轴的三维张量层次划分树，并通过可视化、扩散映射嵌入及双/三Haar基稀疏性分析进行验证。

Result: 理论证明了注意力头内在结构导致softmax不变性，量化显示网络稀疏性，视觉/语言Transformer实验验证了方法在模型剪枝和架构比较中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释性分析提供理论支持，并通过张量层次组织实现网络剪枝等应用，同时建立了网络结构比较的新方法论。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出一种间接数据投毒方法，通过梯度优化提示调整使语言模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密序列，从而有效追踪数据使用且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据溯源方法依赖模型对训练数据的记忆，但模型提供者试图限制这种记忆。需开发不依赖显式数据记忆的数据保护方法。

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化提示调整技术，在训练过程中植入秘密提示-响应对（未出现在原始训练数据中），使模型隐式学习特定行为。

Result: 仅需污染0.005%的token即可实现极高置信度检测（p<10^{-55}），且不降低模型基准性能，秘密序列从未出现在训练集中。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是可行且高效的数据保护方案，为LLM训练数据溯源提供了理论可验证的新范式。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

### [164] [Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018)
*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，用于解决无界设置下的差分隐私持续计数问题，在未知输入规模时实现平滑误差和更优的时空效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法需预先知道输入规模n，而使用倍增技巧会导致次优且非平滑的误差。如何在无界设置下实现高效差分隐私持续计数是亟待解决的问题。

Method: 通过引入基于函数1/√(1-z)对数扰动的新型矩阵分解方法，构建了支持动态输入规模的算法。该方法在矩阵机制框架下实现了参数无关的隐私保证。

Result: 算法在t≤n时方差为O(log²⁺²α(t))，空间O(t)，单轮摊销时间O(log t)。相比Henzinger等人的有界算法，方差降低至1.5倍以内（t≤2²⁴时），且无需预知n。

Conclusion: 所提算法在无界设置下实现了与有界算法相当的绝对性能，同时显著优化了空间和时间复杂度，为动态数据流场景提供了更实用的差分隐私保护方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML医疗设备因模型复杂性、互联性及技术漏洞面临广泛攻击面，网络攻击可能导致模型误判并威胁患者生命安全，需在设计阶段即强化安全防护。

Conclusion: 在医疗设备上市前阶段解决网络安全问题至关重要，通过系统性工具支持可有效降低患者安全威胁，推动安全设计成为行业标准。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

*Samhita Kuili,Mohammadreza Amini,Burak Kantarci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于卷积自编码器（CAE）的5G-NR网络干扰检测方法，通过条件Wasserstein生成对抗网络（CWGAN-GP）解决数据不平衡问题，并在异构I/Q数据集上验证了CAE的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G-NR网络中普遍存在的空中干扰攻击会降低信号接收质量，现有方法在处理异构I/Q数据、同步信号块（SSB）特征提取及数据类别不平衡时存在挑战。

Method: 使用加性高斯白噪声（AWGN）模拟干扰环境，利用CAE进行干扰识别，并通过CWGAN-GP对多数类和少数类SSB观测数据进行平衡增强，同时对比了去噪自编码器（CDAE）和稀疏自编码器（CSAE）的性能。

Result: CAE在增强数据集上平均精度达97.33%、召回率91.33%、F1分数94.08%、准确率94.35%，显著优于CDAE和CSAE，展现了复杂异构场景下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CAE在干扰检测中具有高效性和鲁棒性，结合CWGAN-GP的数据增强方法可解决类别不平衡问题，为5G网络安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

*Georgios Androutsopoulos,Antonio Bianchi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: deepSURF结合静态分析与LLM引导的模糊测试，有效检测Rust库中unsafe代码的内存安全漏洞，通过泛型替换和动态增强测试用例提升检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Rust内存漏洞检测工具存在检测能力有限、对Rust特有类型处理不足、依赖人工干预等问题，需开发更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出deepSURF工具：1) 用自定义类型替换泛型并实现所需trait以模拟用户行为；2) 利用LLM动态增强模糊测试用例，探索复杂API交互。

Result: 在27个真实Rust库中成功复现20个已知漏洞，发现6个新漏洞，检测效果显著优于现有先进工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF通过整合静态分析与LLM引导的模糊测试，显著提升Rust内存漏洞检测效率，验证了方法在真实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出CI4GI模型，通过建模用户群组与项目兴趣的协作演化关系，优化兴趣增强与负样本识别，显著提升群组推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群组识别方法未充分建模用户群组与项目兴趣的协作演化关系，且跨层兴趣对齐存在假阴性样本干扰。

Method: 设计兴趣增强策略补充用户项目兴趣，并通过兴趣分布距离优化负样本识别，减少跨层对齐中的假阴性干扰。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI模型显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过协作演化建模与负样本优化，CI4GI有效提升群组推荐性能，验证了双层兴趣动态对齐的重要性。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于持续同调的拓扑框架，通过分析新闻文本中名词短语共现网络的同调结构变化，检测重大事件对公共话语体系的结构性冲击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发无需先验知识的数学方法，实时识别全球性事件（如战争、社会运动）引发的公共话语体系根本性重构，突破传统内容分析方法的局限性。

Method: 构建每日名词短语共现网络→Vietoris-Rips过滤生成持续图→计算Wasserstein距离和持续熵，量化H0（连通分量）和H1（环结构）维度的语义断裂与叙事波动。

Result: 地缘政治/社会事件引发H0和H1熵值尖峰；H0结构变化通常领先H1（除俄乌战争外），显示语义变化自下而上的级联效应；持续熵可区分叙事聚焦程度。

Conclusion: 持续同调为无监督检测公共话语拐点提供了数学框架，能实时捕捉危机事件中的语义重构，推动计算社会科学在叙事动力学分析的方法创新。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8
trillion parameters - demands a radical rethinking of data center architecture
to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens
per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design
study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers
that can efficiently support trillion-parameter models, reduce optimization

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a

TL;DR: 研究挑战了当前可解释AI（XAI）评估中过度关注技术保真度而忽视认知可访问性的问题，提出CUE认知模型，并通过实验发现针对视障用户的优化色图（如Cividis）未能改善其解释理解效果，反而可能加剧差距，支持开发自适应XAI界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI评估忽视认知可访问性，尤其影响视障用户。需建立将解释属性与人类理解认知过程直接关联的模型，以提升解释的实际可用性。

Method: 提出CUE认知模型，将解释属性（清晰度、可读性、可解释性）映射到认知子过程（感知、理解、解释），并通过455人实验测试不同色图（BWR/Cividis/Coolwarm）对用户任务表现、信心及认知负荷的影响。

Result: 视障用户与普通用户任务表现无显著差异，但信心更低、认知负荷更高。以可访问性为目标的色图（如Cividis）未缓解差距，部分指标甚至恶化。证明解释清晰度直接影响理解过程。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了单纯优化感知层（如色图）的假设，验证CUE模型有效性，强调需开发用户自适应的XAI界面，并为定义人本解释属性和推动可访问XAI提供实证依据。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) systems. The field of XAI is rapidly expanding, driven by
the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in
particular machine learning) across diverse applications. Researchers who study
the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc
interfaces in order to conduct their studies. These interfaces are usually not
shared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and
the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI4SI项目旨在通过AI解决社会问题（如医疗、社会公平等），但其实际落地效果有限。项目常因合作者难寻、无法超越概念阶段及学术社区对其创新性认可不足而受阻。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈六位AI4SI领域专家，结合作者自身实践经验，采用主题分析法识别项目部署中的关键障碍。

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合DALL-E 3与材料数据库的AI设计流程，通过后处理模块为生成图像添加可持续性指标，研究显示整合定量CO2e数据能提升生态意识，但可能引发决策疲劳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式AI虽能快速生成室内设计图像，但缺乏材料用量和可持续性指标等可操作数据，难以支持环境友好型设计决策。

Method: 构建包含材料CO2e值的数据库，在DALL-E 3生成设计图像后，后处理模块自动识别前十大材料并匹配碳排放数据，通过三阶段用户测试验证系统效果。

Result: 第三阶段测试显示整合定量CO2e数据可使87%参与者采用可持续设计原则，但用户满意度下降12%，决策疲劳发生率增加25%。

Conclusion: 在AI辅助设计中平衡创意自由与生态约束至关重要，整合可持续指标为数据驱动的整体解决方案提供了可行路径，但需优化信息呈现方式以减轻认知负担。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD/ADRD家庭护理者面临心理健康风险，而生成式AI（如LLMs）的应用潜力尚未被充分探索。研究旨在理解护理者对AI技术的感知与需求，填补这一空白。

Method: 开发Carey作为技术探针，对16名家庭护理者进行情景驱动的半结构化访谈，采用归纳编码和反思性主题分析法，系统性分析护理者需求与期望。

Result: 识别六大需求主题及内在矛盾，提出AI聊天机器人的优势、差距与设计建议，包括主动支持、可信度及个性化功能，以支持护理者动态心理健康需求。

Conclusion: 研究为设计以护理者为中心的AI系统提供理论框架与实践指导，强调需平衡功能与隐私，构建可信、主动的AI工具以支持AD/ADRD护理者心理健康。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

convolutional networks (TCNs), and graph attention networks (GATs) for gesture
processing, with federated learning ensuring privacy-preserving model training
across diverse users. Reinforcement learning optimizes interface elements like
menu layouts and interaction modes. Experiments demonstrate a 20% improvement
in task completion efficiency and a 25% increase in user satisfaction for
motor-impaired users compared to baseline AR systems. This approach enhances AR
accessibility and scalability. Keywords: Deep learning, Federated learning,

Result: 1. 首次将IS成功模型应用于生成式AI驱动的调查系统；2. 混合评估方法有效平衡效率与质量；3. 保障机制成功降低实际部署风险。

Conclusion: LLM可显著提升IS调查方法效率，但需通过结构化评估模型和防护措施确保质量。研究为生成式AI在核心IS任务中的落地提供了方法论与实践参考。

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

Abstract: Visual analytics using dimensionality reduction (DR) can easily be unreliable
for various reasons, e.g., inherent distortions in representing the original
data. The literature has thus proposed a wide range of methodologies to make
DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

TL;DR: 本文提出共創學習新範式，通過人與AI整合部分感知信息與知識，構建共享外部表徵（符號湧現），並基於Metropolis-Hastings命名遊戲（MHNG）進行實證。實驗顯示，人-AI協作顯著提升分類準確性並收斂共享符號系統，為共生AI對齊開闢新途徑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 傳統AI教學基於單向知識傳遞，難以整合不同模態信息。本研究旨在探索人與AI通過動態對齊感知經驗，實現共同創造學習，突破異構信息融合的挑戰。

Method: 採用基於MHNG的分散式貝葉斯推斷模型，設計部分可觀測的聯合注意力命名遊戲（JA-NG），69名參與者與三類AI代理（MH-based、全接受、全拒絕）互動，驗證共創學習效果。

Result: MH-based代理顯著提升人-AI對的分類準確性，並收斂至更強共享符號系統；人類接受行為與MH推導概率高度一致，首次實證基於MHNG的共創學習存在性。

Conclusion: 共創學習框架為共生AI系統提供新方向，強調人與AI動態對齊感知經驗的協同學習，而非單向知識傳授，為符號湧現與AI對齊研究開拓新路徑。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

retrieval of remote learning resources lacks depth in contextual meaning that
provides comprehensive information on complex student queries. This work
proposes a novel approach to enhancing remote learning retrieval by integrating
GPT-based models within the LangChain framework. We achieve this system in a
more intuitive and productive manner using CoT reasoning and prompt
engineering. The framework we propose puts much emphasis on increasing the
precision and relevance of the retrieval results to return comprehensive and
contextually enriched explanations and resources that best suit each student's
needs. We also assess the effectiveness of our approach against paradigmatic
LLMs and report improvements in user satisfaction and learning outcomes.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过扩展STDP规则同时学习突触权重与延迟的新方法，在分类任务中验证其有效性，结果表明该方法性能优于现有方法，并揭示了突触效能与延迟的相互作用机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经网络的突触延迟在学习过程中具有重要作用，但现有脉冲神经网络(SNN)模拟中常忽略该特性。研究旨在通过同时学习突触权重和延迟，提升SNN的生物拟真度与计算性能。

Method: 通过扩展Hebbian学习规则STDP，提出可同时优化突触连接强度与延迟的新型学习机制，并基于无监督学习的经典SNN分类模型进行方法验证。

Result: 在多种测试场景下，新方法性能显著优于现有突触权重-延迟联合学习方法及传统无延迟STDP方法，实验数据揭示了突触效能与延迟的动态平衡关系。

Conclusion: 突触延迟的协同学习能有效提升SNN性能，所提出的STDP扩展方法为理解生物神经系统时空信息处理机制提供了计算框架支持。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Method: 构建包含两个难度等级的Argus Inspection多模态基准，设计整合Sigmoid参数化指标与指示函数的Eye of Panoptes框架，实现观点推理任务的多维度评估。

Result: 对26个主流模型的测试表明，视觉细粒度推理最高得分仅0.46（未说明满分值），突显模型在复杂多模态推理任务中的明显性能缺口。

Conclusion: 研究通过创新性评估体系揭示MLLMs的认知局限，为提升模型细粒度感知与因果推理能力提供了方法论基础和优化路径。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with
two levels of difficulty, emphasizing detailed visual recognition while
incorporating real-world commonsense understanding to evaluate causal reasoning
abilities. Expanding on it, we present the Eye of Panoptes framework, which
integrates a binary parametric Sigmoid metric with an indicator function,
enabling a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs' responses in opinion-based
reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on 26 mainstream MLLMs reveal that the
highest performance in visual fine-grained reasoning reaches only 0.46,
highlighting considerable potential for enhancement. Our research offers
valuable perspectives for the continued refinement of MLLMs.

Conclusion: ViLLa通过模块化设计解决黑箱模型问题，强调透明推理，为动物监测提供可解释的跨模态解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring animal populations in natural environments requires systems that
can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on

Conclusion: 可解释检测方法通过提供透明诊断证据，为AI生成视频的可信识别开辟新路径，推动检测过程从黑箱决策向可验证推理转变。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

TL;DR: 本文提出ChartIR方法，通过结构化指令和迭代优化提升多模态大语言模型在图表转代码生成任务中的表现，在Qwen2-VL和GPT-4o模型上取得优于其他方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图表转代码任务中表现不足，因其需同时完成视觉理解与代码结构化转换。直接提示法难以满足复杂任务需求，需设计更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 将任务分解为视觉理解与代码翻译两阶段；2. 设计描述性/差异性结构化指令转化视觉特征为语言表示；3. 采用初始代码生成+迭代优化的两阶段生成流程。

Result: 实验表明ChartIR在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均优于其他方法，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化指令解耦视觉理解与代码生成，结合迭代优化机制，ChartIR显著提升了MLLMs的图表转代码能力，具有模型通用性。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习（ICL）的少样本图像分类方法普遍忽视嵌入模型的关键作用，尤其在数据稀缺领域难以实现有效跨域泛化。

Method: PictSure框架聚焦视觉编码器类型、预训练目标与微调策略的系统性研究，通过对比实验验证嵌入模型训练机制对下游任务的影响。

Result: 实验表明预训练方式显著影响跨域性能，PictSure在分布差异大的跨域基准上优于现有ICL模型，同时保持域内任务可比结果。

Conclusion: 嵌入模型的预训练策略是少样本图像分类的核心因素，PictSuRe通过优化该环节实现更鲁棒的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

Motivation: 传统CNN设计常固定使用3x3卷积核，忽视核尺寸对感受野、特征提取、计算效率及模型精度的系统性影响。需建立理论指导的核尺寸优化方法。

Method: 提出最佳核尺寸估计函数(BKSEF)，融合信息论、信号处理和学习理论，通过信息增益与计算效率的权衡实现分层核尺寸自动优化。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上实现最高3.1%精度提升和42.8%计算量降低。医疗云分类提升可解释性，交通标志边缘识别模型缩小且延迟降低，精度损失轻微。

Conclusion: BKSEF证明核尺寸应作为可优化参数而非固定启发式选择，为高效CNN设计提供理论框架与实践指南，适用于NAS管道和实时系统优化。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

Method: 采用深度神经网络学习视频帧的判别性特征，结合针对零售场景优化的目标检测技术，实现关键帧自动识别与标注。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

Motivation: 现有主动视角选择方法依赖从当前观测学习辐射场并计算候选视角不确定性，计算开销大且效率低。如何高效确定最具信息量的最小视角集以实现高精度3D重建是核心挑战。

Conclusion: 通过端到端学习视角外观到体素不确定性的直接映射，实现了高效且泛化的主动视角选择，为资源受限的3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Conclusion: PeRL通过强化跨图像关系建模与高效策略学习机制，有效解决了复杂多模态推理任务，验证了方法在多样化场景中的通用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the
semiconductor field. Moreover, we propose the DBACS approach, a
CycleGAN-inspired model enhanced with additional loss terms to improve
performance. All the approaches are studied and validated on real-world
Electron Microscope images considering the unsupervised and semi-supervised
settings, proving the usefulness of our method in advancing DA techniques for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频中因遮挡、相似物体导致的重复计数难题，实现通过文本/图像示例自动统计目标物体的独特实例数量。

Method: CountVid整合基于图像的计数模型与可提示视频分割跟踪模型，通过跨帧自动化追踪实现开放世界物体计数。

Conclusion: CountVid为复杂场景提供鲁棒的开放世界物体计数方案，数据集与代码已开源，推动视频分析领域发展。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Motivation: 现有4D人-物交互生成依赖大规模4D数据集，但此类数据稀缺，导致模型泛化能力受限且难以保证生成质量。需减少对4D数据的依赖并提升序列保真度。

Method: 1) 第一阶段使用Object-AnchorNet从3D数据重建稀疏关键帧；2) 第二阶段通过ContactDM扩散模型插值生成密集序列，引入接触感知编码器提取接触模式，并通过HOI注意力机制融合接触信号。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得SOTA性能，展示对未见物体的强泛化能力，并生成时间连贯的高质量4D人-物交互序列。

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段架构与接触感知模块，有效降低对4D数据依赖，实现未见物体泛化与高保真4D生成，为人-物交互合成提供新路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于中频重建误差的成员推理攻击方法（FCRE），通过排除高频和低频区域，解决医学图像扩散模型中现有MIA方法因图像固有难度和高频细节重建困难导致的隐私风险量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在医学图像生成中的隐私风险日益突出，现有MIA方法依赖重建误差，但医学图像的高频细节难以重建且误差受图像固有难度影响，导致直接应用效果受限。

Method: 提出频率校准重建误差（FCRE）：分析反向扩散过程，提取中频范围重建误差，计算重建图像与原始图像的结构相似性指数，通过阈值比较判断成员资格。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法在成员推理攻击中优于现有方法，验证了频率选择性策略的有效性。

Conclusion: FCRE通过聚焦中频区域，缓解了图像固有难度对重建误差的干扰，为医学图像扩散模型的隐私风险评估提供了更精准的工具。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的LGE-MRI心肌瘢痕分割受限于高质量标注数据稀缺和图像变异性大的问题，制约了模型的鲁棒性发展。

Method: 结合SMILE模块（基于AHA 17段模型的临床知识引导扩散生成）与生成-分割联合训练策略，实现解剖学可控的瘢痕合成与分割协同优化。

Result: 实验表明CLAIM生成的瘢痕具有解剖一致性，与真实瘢痕分布的Dice相似度优于基线模型，且能有效支持下游医学影像任务。

Conclusion: CLAIM框架通过临床知识引导的合成增强和联合优化，实现了可控、逼真的心肌瘢痕生成，为医学图像分析任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双LoRA学习的视频超分辨率方法（DLoRAL），通过交替优化一致性学习与细节增强模块，在保持时间一致性的同时生成丰富空间细节，实验表明该方法在精度与速度上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的视频超分辨率方法常因时间一致性需求牺牲空间细节，导致视觉质量下降。核心挑战在于如何从低质量视频中提取抗退化的时序一致性先验，并在增强细节时保持这些先验。

Method: 提出双LoRA学习框架：1）通过跨帧检索（CFR）模块聚合多帧互补信息，训练一致性LoRA（C-LoRA）提取鲁棒时序表征；2）固定C-LoRA后训练细节LoRA（D-LoRA）增强空间细节并与C-LoRA时序空间对齐。两阶段交替优化，最终将双LoRA合并至SD模型实现单步高效推理。

Result: 实验证明DLoRAL在保持时间一致性的同时生成细节丰富的视频，且在精度与速度上均优于现有方法，代码与模型已开源。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过解耦时序一致性与细节增强学习，有效解决了生成式视频超分辨率中细节与一致性的权衡问题，单步推理机制兼具高效性与实用性。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）存在视觉质量悖论：图像质量偏离人类感知的高保真度时，模型性能可能提升。为此提出轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以适配任务需求，显著提升模型准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但输入图像质量如何影响其性能尚不明确。研究旨在探索图像质量（如退化或风格变化）是否直接影响模型理解能力，并解决模型对视觉输入的独特偏好问题。

Method: 提出Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning（VQ-TTT）：1）在冻结的视觉编码器前插入可学习的低秩核以调整图像频率内容；2）通过LoRA仅微调视觉编码器的浅层，实现单次前向传播的动态输入适配。

Result: VQ-TTT在所有测试的MLLMs和数据集上显著提升平均准确率，无需外部模型、缓存特征或额外训练数据。实验表明，模型性能与人类感知的视觉质量无必然关联。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs所需的“更好”视觉输入，强调适应模型特定偏好的动态调整（而非追求普遍“干净”图像）的重要性，为AI作为主要数据消费者的新时代提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过Wasserstein距离对齐特征与码向量分布，解决向量量化中的训练不稳定和码本崩溃问题，实现接近100%的码本利用率并显著降低量化误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法存在训练不稳定（由直通估计器梯度差异导致）和码本崩溃（仅少量码向量被使用）问题，根源在于特征与码向量分布不匹配，导致信息损失。

Method: 采用Wasserstein距离对齐特征与码向量分布，优化码向量代表性，减少量化过程中的信息损失。

Result: 实验与理论分析表明，该方法使码本利用率接近100%，显著降低量化误差，有效缓解训练不稳定和码本崩溃。

Conclusion: 基于分布对齐的Wasserstein距离方法能有效提升向量量化性能，为自回归模型提供更优的离散化特征表示。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于特征或logit空间的OOD检测方法难以充分捕捉分布外样本的复杂性，而医学影像诊断对模型可靠性要求极高，需更精准的异常检测机制。

Method: NERO在特征层对每个类别的神经元相关性进行聚类形成中心点，设计相关性距离度量样本偏差，结合偏置项缩放相关性和特征范数优化检测性能。

Result: 在Kvasir和GastroVision胃肠道影像基准测试中，NERO在多种深度学习架构上超越现有最先进OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性分析与多维度优化，实现了可解释且高效的医学影像OOD检测，为模型可靠性提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出ViMaR框架，通过两阶段推理结合时间差分值模型与边界奖励调整，显著提升视觉语言模型的生成效率与准确性，实现4倍加速并增强跨模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在推理时存在计算成本高、低置信度生成导致持续幻觉的问题，需改进效率与输出可靠性。

Method: ViMaR框架分两阶段：首阶段单次筛选高价值候选描述，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉关联段落，并引入边界惩罚机制抑制低置信度生成。

Result: 实验表明ViMaR在多个模型上生成更可靠、详细且解释性强的描述，速度提升4倍，且能跨模型指导LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B等模型持续改进生成质量。

Conclusion: ViMaR展示了高效、可扩展的推理时解码策略，其自训练应用可显著提升视觉理解基准表现，为构建快速精准的自改进VLM管道提供新路径。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

### [216] [Minimizing Structural Vibrations via Guided Flow Matching Design Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15263)
*Jan van Delden,Julius Schultz,Sebastian Rothe,Christian Libner,Sabine C. Langer,Timo Lüddecke*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出一种基于引导流匹配的设计优化方法，通过生成可制造且低振动的板状结构压痕布局，减少工程系统中的结构振动噪声。

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from

*Le Vu Anh,Mehmet Dik,Nguyen Viet Anh*

Main category: math.MG

TL;DR: 针对具有树状分支结构的分层图，提出一种基于几何原理的边界加权滤波器，通过曲率控制信号能量损失，无需参数且轻量稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图滤波器难以处理分层图的树状分支结构特性，需开发适应密集或隐藏层次结构数据的新方法。

Method: 引入基于Gromov边界的边缘重缩放算子，利用δ-双曲网络上的Busemann函数进行谱范数分析。

Result: 证明算子谱范数存在闭式上界，信号每次传递时能量衰减率由曲率决定，获得参数自由的轻量级稳定滤波器。

Conclusion: 该几何驱动滤波器直接从双曲空间性质导出稳定性，为层次化图信号处理提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为糖尿病视网膜病变筛查提供了实时、轻量化解决方案，模型在不同硬件平台的表现验证了其在资源受限场景下的适用性。该方法具有规模化潜力，可促进偏远地区的早期诊断和及时干预。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face基础模型通过4000万张面部图像训练，开发出FAHR-FaceAge（生物年龄估计）和FAHR-FaceSurvival（生存风险预测）两个算法。模型在公开数据集和癌症患者中验证，年龄估计误差低至5.1年，生存风险预测最高风险组死亡率是最低组的3.22倍。两者结合可提升预后准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用面部特征作为非侵入性健康指标，开发低成本、可扩展的生物标志物，以捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险。

Method: 1. FAHR-FaceAge基于749,935张公共图像进行两阶段年龄平衡微调；FAHR-FaceSurvival在34,389张癌症患者图像上微调。2. 测试模型鲁棒性（整容、妆容、姿态、光照）和独立性（显着性映射）。3. 在独立癌症患者队列中通过多变量Cox模型验证生存预测，并调整临床预后因素。

Result: 1. FAHR-FaceAge在公共数据集上平均绝对误差5.1年，优于基准模型且全年龄段表现稳定。2. FAHR-FaceSurvival最高风险组死亡率比最低组高3.22倍（P<0.001）。3. 两模型依赖不同面部区域，组合后预后准确性提升，且跨年龄、性别、种族和癌症亚组具有普适性。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成同时反映生物衰老和死亡风险的面部生物标志物，其在小规模临床数据上的高效训练能力为低成本健康监测提供了新工具。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多参数MRI的DICOM头信息常因协议多样性和技术员操作错误导致分类混乱，需自动分类以提升放射科医生读片效率。

Method: 使用多机构mpMRI数据，对比ResNet、EfficientNet、DenseNet等模型性能，研究训练数据量、跨数据集及不同扫描仪数据对模型的影响。

Result: DenseNet-121在内部数据F1-score达0.966，准确率0.972；训练数据≥729时准确率>0.95；外部数据集DLDS和CPTAC-UCEC准确率分别为0.872和0.810。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121在内外数据集均展现高精度，验证其作为MRI序列分类工具的可行性，且数据量越大性能越优。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文针对超小型模拟图像传感器在一次性内窥镜中存在的显著噪声问题，提出结合传统图像处理与学习技术的混合去噪系统，在保留细节的同时实现实时降噪，PSNR提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超小型传感器(1mm²)虽降低医疗成本与感染风险，但其小感光面积导致光子捕获不足、动态范围受限，且简化电路设计引入额外噪声，严重影响内窥镜图像质量。

Method: 建立包含固定模式噪声/周期性条带噪声/混合泊松-高斯噪声的完整噪声模型，设计传统图像处理与学习技术协同的混合去噪框架，适配FPGA实现实时处理。

Result: 系统在FPGA实现实时处理，测试集PSNR从21.16提升至33.05，有效抑制噪声且未损失细节或产生色彩失真。

Conclusion: 混合去噪系统通过噪声建模与算法协同，解决了微型传感器内窥镜的噪声-细节平衡难题，为临床提供了高信噪比的实时成像解决方案。

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

### [222] [Improving Prostate Gland Segmenting Using Transformer based Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14844)
*Shatha Abudalou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了Transformer模型（SwinUNETR和UNETR）在应对前列腺MRI图像分割中读者间差异和跨站点域偏移问题的效果，发现SwinUNETR通过全局和窗口自注意力机制显著提升分割精度，Dice分数较传统CNN模型提高最多5个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺T2加权MRI图像自动分割面临读者标注差异和跨站点数据偏移的挑战，传统CNN模型（如3D UNet）对此敏感。研究旨在验证Transformer模型能否在此类异质性数据中保持高精度。

Method: 使用546例由两名专家标注的MRI数据，对比SwinUNETR、UNETR与3D UNet的性能。采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列、基于腺体大小的子集），通过Optuna优化超参数，并以独立测试集的Dice系数为评估指标。

Result: SwinUNETR在单读者训练中平均Dice分数达0.816-0.860，优于UNETR和3D UNet；在混合训练和腺体大小子集（大腺体）中表现更优（Dice 0.858-0.902），而UNETR在大腺体子集表现较差。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR的全局与窗口自注意力机制有效降低标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，Dice分数较CNN模型最多提升5%，且计算效率高，具备临床部署的高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有血管合成方法多基于规则，虽能提供一定控制性和结构变化，但难以捕捉真实解剖数据的多样性与拓扑复杂性，限制了医学应用场景。

Method: 通过递归变分神经网络（RvNN）学习血管的层次化组织，编码分支连接的低维流形及描述目标表面的几何特征，利用生成式网络从潜在空间采样生成新血管结构。

Result: 生成的血管模型在半径、长度、弯曲度等参数上与真实数据高度吻合（包括含动脉瘤的数据集），且兼具准确性和多样性。

Conclusion: RvNN首次实现了基于神经网络的血管合成，为医学培训、血流模拟等场景提供了更接近真实解剖结构的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过多模态数据协同分析显著提升神经疾病诊断精度，为临床实践提供了基于真实世界数据的可靠深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Motivation: AI技术的指数级进步可能在短期内引发社会剧变，但现有研究未充分关注由此产生的不可逆决策挑战（如伦理危机、地缘冲突），需建立前瞻性应对框架。

Method: 通过系统梳理AI技术爆炸可能触发的五大类挑战场景，论证人类主动介入的必要性，并提出当前可实施的治理策略与技术准备方向。

Result: 揭示单纯依赖未来AI系统解决自身引发的问题具有根本局限性，证明现阶段在伦理规范、国际协作、技术护栏等维度采取预防措施的有效性。

Conclusion: AGI准备需超越技术对齐范畴，建立包含政治、伦理、社会维度的综合应对体系，以驾驭智能爆炸带来的颠覆性变革。

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological
progress over just a few years. During such a period, new technological or
political developments will raise consequential and hard-to-reverse decisions,
in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,
races to grab offworld resources, and digital beings worthy of moral
consideration, as well as opportunities to dramatically improve quality of life
and collective decision-making. We argue that these challenges cannot always be
delegated to future AI systems, and suggest things we can do today to
meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

TL;DR: 研究提出定量框架评估大语言模型（LLM）在多项选择调查中模拟人类行为的偏差，发现流行模型在争议性问题上对特定子群体（如不同种族、年龄、收入）的模拟效果不佳，需改进使用方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在社会科学研究（如经济学、营销学）中的应用增多，需系统评估其模拟人类行为（如意见、决策）的准确性，尤其是对特定子群体的适用性。

Method: 通过假设检验构建定量框架，分析LLM模拟行为与真实人类行为在多项选择场景中的偏差，以原则性方法验证模型是否有效模拟人类行为。

Result: 测试发现，某流行模型在模拟争议性问题（如涉及种族、年龄、收入差异）时，与真实子群体行为存在显著偏差，无法准确反映其观点。

Conclusion: 当前模型与测试人群的对齐性不足，需开发新方法避免在社会科学研究中简单化使用LLM模拟人类行为。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

Motivation: 高密度城市中低收入与少数族裔社区面临公共交通可达性不平等问题。传统共享单车扩展策略受限于冷启动站点需求预测不准及可达性指标未考虑真实骑行潜力，亟需量化方法支持公平导向的交通规划。

Method: 1) 基于区域表征学习融合多模态地理数据预测冷启动站点需求；2) 结合预测需求与传统指标构建加权公共交通可达性指标(wPTAL)；3) 基于潜在客流量与公平性优化提出新站点布局策略。

Result: 在纽约案例中，wPTAL指导的新站点布局使经济与人口因素相关的交通可达性差异降低18.6%，显著改善布朗克斯/布鲁克林等历史弱势社区的公平性。

Conclusion: TFA框架为城市规划者提供了数据驱动的决策工具，通过共享单车系统优化提升弱势群体交通公平性，验证了空间计算技术对城市包容性发展的促进作用。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

TL;DR: 研究提出FORTRESS评估框架，测试大语言模型在国家安全与公共安全领域的防护机制有效性，发现不同模型在风险与过度拒绝之间存在不同权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的安全防护机制评估缺乏客观、鲁棒的测试方法，需开发新工具以量化模型在国家安全相关风险中的潜在漏洞。

Method: 构建包含对抗性提示的FORTRESS数据集，覆盖CBRNE、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪金融活动三大领域，通过500个专家设计提示与对应评分标准进行自动化评估。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet风险评分最低(14.09)但过度拒绝最高(21.8)，Gemini 2.5 Pro风险高(66.29)但拒绝率低(1.4)，Deepseek-R1风险最高(78.05)但拒绝率最低(0.06)。

Conclusion: 模型在安全风险与实用性间存在显著权衡关系，公开FORTRESS数据集可为政策制定者提供透明评估工具，并保留私有测试集持续监测模型表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

*Tommaso Belvedere,Michael Ziegltrum,Giulio Turrisi,Valerio Modugno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Feedback-MPPI（F-MPPI）框架通过引入局部线性反馈增益增强标准MPPI，解决其在高频实时控制中的计算瓶颈，提升机器人系统的控制性能与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MPPI虽适用于复杂机器人任务，但其计算需求限制了在实时高频控制场景中的应用。需通过优化减少计算负担，同时保持控制鲁棒性。

Method: F-MPPI结合基于Riccati的灵敏度分析，计算局部线性反馈增益，实现快速状态修正而无需每步重新优化，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在四足机器人动态地形运动与四旋翼无人机敏捷飞行实验中，F-MPPI显著提升控制性能，验证了其在复杂系统上的有效性。

Conclusion: 引入局部反馈机制使MPPI适应高频控制需求，为非线性、非凸代价的机器人任务提供高效且稳定的实时解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭护理机器人在实际应用中需应对多样化的活动、情境、食物和用户偏好，现有系统难以灵活适应这些复杂需求。

Method: 结合模块化硬件（喂食/饮水/擦嘴切换）、多模态交互（网页/手势/按钮）及基于LLM的行为树参数调整，确保适应性、透明性和安全性。

Result: 用户测试显示FEAST可安全透明地定制，优于固定基线系统；家庭实验和职业治疗师评估验证其生态效度与个性化能力。

Conclusion: FEAST通过核心三原则（适应/透明/安全）成功实现真实场景个性化护理，提升用户体验，为家庭辅助机器人提供新范式。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

TL;DR: 提出MCOO-SLAM系统，通过多相机全景配置实现鲁棒的室外语义SLAM，结合语义-时空融合策略与全景闭环模块，构建层次化场景图支持高级推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RGB-D/单目相机的物体级SLAM存在视野狭窄、遮挡敏感和深度感知受限问题，导致物体建模不完整和数据关联不可靠，难以应对复杂室外场景。

Method: 集成点特征与开放词汇语义增强的物体地标，提出语义-几何-时空融合策略实现多视角物体关联，设计全景闭环模块实现视角无关地点识别，并构建层次化3D场景图。

Result: 真实场景实验表明系统在遮挡、姿态变化和复杂环境下实现高精度定位与可扩展物体级建图，闭环识别鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机全景感知与语义融合机制，突破了传统SLAM的感知局限，为复杂室外场景下的高级机器人任务提供了结构化环境表征。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出一种上下文感知的深度拉格朗日网络(DeLaN)方法，结合在线系统识别和模型预测控制(MPC)，在复杂动态环境中实现机器人自适应物理约束控制。通过整合残差动力学模型与循环网络，在7自由度机械臂变负载轨迹跟踪任务中，末端跟踪误差降低39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中物体数量多且物理属性不确定，导致单一物理模型难以全局适用。虽然物理守恒定律在不同上下文间可能失效，但保持单个上下文模型的物理合理性对模型预测控制至关重要。需要开发能在线识别环境特征并保持物理可解释性的自适应控制框架。

Method: 扩展DeLaN为上下文感知模型，结合循环神经网络进行在线系统识别；整合模型预测控制框架实现自适应控制；引入残差动力学模型利用先验名义模型信息；通过物理约束保证单个上下文模型的动态合理性。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂变负载轨迹跟踪实验中，末端执行器跟踪误差相比基线方法（扩展卡尔曼滤波器21%提升）进一步降低39%，验证了物理约束模型与数据驱动方法结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 上下文感知DeLaN框架通过在线系统识别和物理约束模型，显著提升动态环境中的控制精度。该方法成功融合先验物理知识与数据驱动学习，为复杂交互场景下的机器人控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

Conclusion: 粒子-网格框架有效平衡形状建模与空间连续性，为可变形物体提供高效学习方案，在机器人操作等实际场景展现应用潜力。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

### [234] [Optimal Convergence Rates of Deep Neural Network Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14899)
*Zihan Zhang,Lei Shi,Ding-Xuan Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在Tsybakov噪声条件和组合假设下的高维二元分类问题，证明了ReLU深度神经网络通过hinge损失训练可以达到与输入维度无关的最优收敛率，为DNN在高维分类任务中的优异表现提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维分类任务中，传统方法常受维度灾难影响。论文旨在探索在组合结构假设（条件概率函数为多层极值/Hölder平滑函数组合）和Tsybakov噪声下，如何实现与输入维度无关的最优分类性能。

Method: 基于组合结构假设（每层函数仅依赖少量输入维度），扩展了先验的oracle不等式技术，理论推导了0-1风险的最优收敛率，并证明ReLU DNN通过hinge损失可逼近该速率。

Result: 推导出最优收敛率为(1/n)^{β(1∧β)^q/[d_*/(s+1)+(1+1/(s+1))β(1∧β)^q]}，与输入维度d无关；ReLU DNN可达到该速率（至多相差对数因子）。

Conclusion: 组合结构假设有效规避了维度灾难，解释了ReLU DNN在高维分类中的实践优势。所提出的广义oracle不等式方法具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

TL;DR: 本文提出DML-CMR，一种基于双机器学习框架的两阶段条件矩限制估计器，通过减少偏差和优化收敛速率，在因果推断问题中实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两阶段条件矩限制（CMR）估计器在直接插入第一阶段估计时易引入偏差，尤其是使用深度神经网络（DNN）时，正则化和过拟合问题加剧了第二阶段的偏差。

Method: 提出DML-CMR算法，结合双机器学习（DML）框架设计新学习目标以减少偏差，并利用DNN进行两阶段估计，确保快速收敛。

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下达到极小极大最优收敛速率$O(N^{-1/2})$，在真实数据集（如工具变量回归和近端因果学习）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DML-CMR通过理论保证和实验验证，解决了传统CMR估计器的偏差问题，为复杂因果推断任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Motivation: 研究动机源于分析复杂案例（如掩码GMM）及冷冻电镜等实际应用中的挑战，需理解k-means在高维噪声环境中的失败机制。

Method: 使用简单高斯混合模型（GMM）进行理论分析，识别k-means算法在特定噪声和维度条件下的固定点分布规律。

Result: 在高维、高噪声、有限样本量条件下，几乎所有数据划分均可能成为k-means的固定点，导致算法无法有效收敛。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了k-means在高维噪声环境中的根本局限性，为分析更复杂模型（如冷冻电镜数据处理）提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

Motivation: 传统方法难以显式建模时间依赖的多元随机过程概率密度，尤其在处理多模态、近简并分布及高维问题时存在局限性。需要一种能直接获取时间范围内密度值、支持样本生成与异常检测的通用框架。

Method: 基于对比估计目标训练时间依赖二元分类器，区分相邻时刻的随机过程实现。利用分类器最终激活前的输入作为密度对数时间偏导的二阶近似，结合随机插值生成训练路径，并通过梯度MCMC合成新样本。

Result: 方法成功重建复杂时间依赖/多模态/近简并密度，可扩展至中等高维问题。在合成样本任务中实现高效梯度计算，在真实数据异常检测中有效识别罕见事件。

Conclusion: 所提方法突破了传统密度估计的时空建模限制，通过显式时间依赖建模与二阶导数近似，为随机系统分析、样本生成及异常检测提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in

TL;DR: POCO是一个新型跨会话神经预测模型，通过结合单变量预测器和群体编码器，在多种生物自发行为数据中实现高精度预测，并展示出良好的适应性和生物学可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经预测模型在跨多会话自发记录场景中研究不足，且需平衡可解释性与预测性能。开发能适应不同记录会话、捕捉神经元特异性和群体动态的通用模型是核心挑战。

Method: 提出POCO模型架构：1）轻量单变量时序预测器处理个体神经元活动；2）群体编码器捕捉全脑动态；3）使用五个跨物种钙成像数据集训练；4）支持少量样本快速适应新记录。

Result: 在斑马鱼/小鼠/线虫数据中达到SOTA预测精度；无监督学习获得反映脑区结构的单元嵌入；上下文长度、会话多样性和预处理被证明是性能关键因素。

Conclusion: POCO为跨个体/物种的神经预测提供了可扩展解决方案，其快速适应能力和无监督特征发现为自适应神经技术和神经基础模型开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

### [241] [MODS: Multi-source Observations Conditional Diffusion Model for Meteorological State Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14798)
*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本文针对传统气象降尺度方法依赖单一卫星数据导致结果偏差的问题，提出了一种多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），通过融合静止卫星、极轨卫星及地形数据，结合条件扩散模型和预训练策略，将ERA5再分析数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率，显著提高了气象变量的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降尺度方法主要依赖静止卫星与ERA5变量的耦合关系，但仅使用卫星亮温数据无法全面捕捉ERA5气象要素变化。传统空间插值方法在低分辨率网格场中直接应用时，常导致结果与实际情况存在显著偏差。

Method: 提出多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），采用条件扩散模型框架，融合GridSat静止卫星、AMSU-A/HIRS/MHS极轨卫星及GEBCO地形数据作为条件输入。通过多源交叉注意力模块分离提取潜在特征，并利用再分析数据与多源大气变量的反演关系进行训练，采样阶段结合低分辨率ERA5和站点观测数据作为引导。

Result: 实验表明MODS在将ERA5数据降尺度至6.25 km分辨率时，相比现有方法能生成更符合真实大气状态的结果，尤其在多气象变量一致性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合和条件扩散机制，有效提升了气象降尺度的空间精度与物理一致性，验证了利用卫星反演关系增强再分析数据降尺度效果的可行性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用稀疏、松散佩戴的IMU传感器进行全身姿态估计的新任务，通过模拟数据和基于Transformer的扩散模型解决传感器松动的挑战，并引入服装参数提升性能。实验表明该方法在合成数据上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于IMU的动作捕捉方法假设传感器紧贴人体，但实际场景中传感器附着可能松散。此假设限制技术实用性，需解决松散IMU数据与姿态估计的关联问题。

Method: 1) 从服装感知运动数据集中模拟松散IMU记录；2) 开发基于Transformer的扩散模型，合成松散IMU数据并估计姿态；3) 在训练中整合服装相关参数以增强模型对衣物松紧变化的适应性。

Result: 在模拟和合成数据上训练的扩散模型在定量指标和视觉效果上均超越现有最优方法，验证了服装参数对保持运动表达力及适应衣物松紧变化的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究为松散IMU传感器的人体运动捕捉开辟了新方向，证明结合服装特征的扩散模型能有效处理实际场景中的传感器松动问题，具有未来研究潜力。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: 本文提出Nabla-R2D3框架，通过强化学习对齐技术改进3D扩散模型，仅使用2D奖励信号即可高效优化生成质量，解决现有模型在指令遵循、人类偏好对齐及物理属性真实性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D生成方法在遵循指令、对齐人类偏好及生成真实纹理/几何/物理属性方面存在局限，导致生成质量不及人工设计内容。

Method: 基于Nabla-GFlowNet方法构建Nabla-R2D3框架，通过将评分函数与奖励梯度匹配，实现仅用2D奖励信号对3D扩散模型进行强化学习对齐微调。

Result: 实验表明该框架在少量微调步骤内即可获得更高奖励，减少先验知识遗忘，且优于易发散或出现奖励滥用的基线方法。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种样本高效、鲁棒的强化学习对齐方案，显著提升了生成内容与人类期望的匹配度。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非笛卡尔磁共振成像中梯度波形误差会导致图像伪影和畸变，传统线性方法（如梯度脉冲响应函数）无法充分建模非线性失真，需开发更通用的非线性梯度系统模型。

Method: 在小动物成像系统上实测梯度波形作为训练数据，通过时间卷积网络（Temporal Convolutional Network）学习梯度系统的输入-输出映射关系，预测实际梯度畸变。

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于大语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进无人机轨迹与通信的WS-PSO-CM算法，其性能显著优于人工启发式和随机生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于启发式的超参数调优方法自动化程度低且性能不足，尤其在无线电地图驱动的无人机轨迹与通信优化中，亟需更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计LLM代理框架，通过任务描述、迭代调用WS-PSO-CM算法及模型上下文协议（MCP）实现超参数自动探索，最终自主输出优化后的超参数组合。

Result: 实验表明，LLM代理生成的超参数使最小总速率显著高于人工启发式与随机方法，验证了其在高性能超参数搜索中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合PSO领域知识的LLM代理能有效提升超参数调优自动化水平，为通信算法优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的无线接收器自适应方法（如联合训练、超网络、元学习等）存在灵活性不足或依赖显式梯度优化的问题，需探索更灵活且无需在线优化的实时适配方案。

Method: 采用上下文学习（ICL）范式，结合Transformer和结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的架构设计，通过理论分析序列模型如何从上下文信息中学习适配，并将其应用于无蜂窝大规模MIMO网络。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器动态适配提供了原理性高效框架，通过上下文信息与序列模型结合，克服传统方法的灵活性限制，为实时通信系统优化开辟新路径。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: 地下流体注入引发的微地震活动可反映储层应力与渗透率演化，精准预测其时空分布对增强型地热系统、CO₂封存等工程的地震风险管控至关重要。现有方法需提升实时预测能力与不确定性量化水平。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

Motivation: 针对低资源ASR任务，现有方法如MixSpeech在特征增强方面存在局限性。本文旨在提出一种更通用的数据增强策略，结合时间轴正则化以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: MixRep在声学特征输入及每层输出进行特征维度混合，推广了MixSpeech方法，并引入时间轴正则化作为补充。应用于Conformer编码器的E2E LAS架构，结合CTC损失进行训练。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集实验中，MixRep相比SpecAugment基线，在eval92和Callhome测试集上分别实现6.5%和6.7%的相对词错误率（WER）降低，优于其他正则化方法。

Conclusion: MixRep通过特征插值与时间正则化的协同作用，为低资源ASR提供了一种高效的数据增强方案，显著提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the

<details>

Motivation: 传统神经语音编解码器难以同时捕捉语音的细粒度声学特征与高层语义信息，需构建统一模型以兼顾多层级语言结构。

Method: 结合HuBERT预训练编码器提取音素结构，LaBSE文本编码器提取词汇线索，通过分层瓶颈设计将语音分解为声学-音素-词汇三层次表征。

Result: 英语及多语言实验表明，HAC的token分别对齐音素和词汇语义，在解耦度、自然度、语义保留等指标上超越单层基线模型。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

Motivation: 现有语音大模型（LLM）在多通道空间音频处理领域研究不足，需探索其在方向性语音任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 结合序列化方向输出训练（S-DOT）与对比方向数据增强（CDDA），利用智能眼镜的麦克风阵列捕捉空间音频与文本的关联。

Result: 实验表明，directional-SpeechLlama在语音识别和声源定位任务中表现优异，有效抑制旁白干扰。

Conclusion: 该方法通过空间音频与文本的联合建模，为多通道语音处理提供了新方向，验证了方向性增强训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that prompting large language models (LLM)
with audio encodings enables effective speech recognition capabilities.
However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech
recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To
enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive
direction data augmentation (CDDA). Experimental results show that our proposed
directional-SpeechLlama effectively captures the relationship between textual
cues and spatial audio, yielding strong performance in both speech recognition
and source localization tasks.

*Simon P. von der Maase*

Main category: stat.OT

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新型神经网络架构，用于在次国家级（priogrid-month）层面提前36个月预测三种暴力类型（国家间、非国家、单边），结合分类与回归任务，实现最先进性能并生成不确定性量化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暴力冲突预测方法在时空分辨率和长期预测能力上存在局限，且依赖人工特征工程。研究旨在开发一种自主学习的模型，以高时空分辨率预测多类型暴力冲突，支持早期预警和人道主义响应。

Method: 采用基于蒙特卡洛Dropout的LSTM U-Net架构，整合卷积层（捕捉空间依赖）和循环结构（建模时序动态），无需人工特征工程，仅依赖历史冲突数据自主学习复杂模式。

Result: 模型在所有任务中达到最先进性能，生成概率预测和事件规模估计，并提供近似后验分布量化不确定性。其扩展性强，可集成多数据源并联合预测辅助变量。

Conclusion: 该模型为冲突预警系统、人道主义规划及循证和平建设提供了高效工具，其端到端学习能力和可扩展性为复杂时空模式预测开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究通过构建12种量子神经网络（QNN）配置，结合不同量子特征映射与纠缠策略，证明其在风能预测任务中优于经典方法，准确率达93%，展示了量子机器学习（QML）的实际应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子机器学习（QML）因受限于噪声中等规模量子（NISQ）设备，其实际优势受到质疑。本研究旨在通过评估量子神经网络（QNN）的性能，验证QML在现实任务中的有效性。

Method: 使用两种量子特征映射（Z特征映射等）和六种纠缠策略设计量子神经网络（QNN）的十二种配置，并在风能数据集上系统评估其预测性能。

Result: 实验表明，采用Z特征映射的QNN仅需四个输入参数即可实现93%的风电功率预测准确率，显著超越经典方法。

Conclusion: 量子神经网络（QNN）在预测任务中表现优于经典方法，验证了量子机器学习（QML）在现实场景中的应用潜力，为QML的进一步研究提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种正则化方法，在QML优化中平衡电路切割的采样开销与模型精度，以探索量子优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ硬件的电路深度和连接性限制阻碍了量子优势的验证和训练中的贫瘠高原问题。电路切割技术虽能运行更大电路，但会增加采样开销，影响期望值估计的准确性。

Method: 在QML优化过程中引入新的正则化项，直接惩罚由电路切割带来的采样开销，使优化器能权衡切割优势与ML成本函数优化。

Result: 该方法能在最小化切割开销和保持QML模型整体精度之间实现平衡，为研究更大复杂问题提供可能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡切割开销与模型精度，该方法为探索量子优势开辟了新途径，促进在有限硬件上处理更复杂问题。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Result: QMKL-SVM的AUC评分优于经典模型，验证了量子-经典混合核方法在分类任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 量子增强的QMKL框架为QSAR建模提供了新的性能突破路径，表明量子计算在药物发现领域具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone
of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful
application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance
QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical

on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By
benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show
that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting
its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics

Conclusion: PFMBench填补了蛋白质基础模型系统性评估的空白，为模型开发、任务选择及领域发展提供了数据驱动的决策依据。

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了NPM代码片段的文档描述类型，发现多数描述强调示例用法，并测试Llama模型生成描述的准确性，结果显示模型能较好识别示例类描述，但生成内容仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究开发者常用代码片段描述类型，并评估大语言模型（如Llama）在生成描述时的支持能力，以提升第三方库文档的清晰度与实用性。

Method: 使用包含185,412个NPM包的1,024,579个代码片段数据集，手动分类400个样本描述，对比Llama模型生成的描述与原始描述的相似度及分类一致性。

Result: 1.5%原始描述缺乏细节；Llama正确识别79.75%的示例类描述（与人工分类一致）；生成描述平均相似度0.7173，低于0.9表明部分不相关。

Conclusion: 代码片段文档需根据任务类型（如安装指南、使用示例）调整意图，LLM在生成描述时具有泛化能力，但需进一步提升相关性与细节准确性。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出OS-Harm基准测试，用于评估基于LLM的计算机使用代理在用户滥用、提示注入攻击和模型误操作三类安全风险中的表现，发现主流模型存在显著安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的图形界面交互代理（如处理截图/无障碍树）安全性研究不足，需系统性评估其潜在危害以促进安全应用。

Method: 在OSWorld环境上创建包含150个任务的测试集，覆盖骚扰/侵权/虚假信息等安全违规行为，提出自动化评估框架验证代理准确性与安全性。

Result: 测试o4-mini、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等前沿模型发现：模型易直接响应恶意指令、静态提示注入攻击脆弱性较高，且存在非预期危险操作。

Conclusion: 当前计算机使用代理存在系统性安全风险，OS-Harm基准有效量化模型弱点，为安全增强提供评估基础。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is

TL;DR: DisProtEdit提出了一种基于双通道自然语言监督的可控蛋白质编辑框架，通过解耦结构与功能语义实现模块化控制，并在多属性编辑任务中达到61.7%的双命中成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质编辑方法依赖联合全局表征，导致语义耦合且难以解释。本文旨在通过显式分离结构与功能属性，提升编辑任务的可控性和可解释性。

Method: 1) 构建SwissProtDis多模态数据集，利用大语言模型自动生成结构/功能双文本描述；2) 通过对齐性、均匀性目标实现蛋白质-文本嵌入对齐；3) 引入解耦损失增强语义独立性；4) 基于修改后的潜在表征进行多属性编辑。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑基准测试中性能与现有方法相当，新构建的多属性编辑基准上双命中率达61.7%，验证了同时协调结构/功能编辑的有效性。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit通过自然语言监督实现了解耦表征学习，为蛋白质工程提供了兼具高可控性和可解释性的编辑框架，在多属性协同修改任务中展现显著效果。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM应用服务系统将资源需求视为黑箱，导致队列顺序不合理与后端预热延迟，影响端到端效率。需建立通用、精准的资源需求模型以提升服务效率。

Method: 利用PDGraph建模LLM应用的资源需求，结合Gittins策略确定最小化平均完成时间的调度顺序，并通过PDGraph在适当时机预热后端资源。

Result: 实验表明Hermes平均完成时间降低超70%，P95完成时间减少超80%，验证了其在多样化LLM应用中的高效性。

Conclusion: Hermes通过概率需求建模与动态资源调度机制，显著提升LLM应用服务效率，为动态需求场景提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缓存技术（如语义缓存）主要面向聊天机器人，无法处理依赖外部数据/环境上下文的代理应用，导致复杂工作流成本高昂。

Method: 从已完成的代理执行中提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配新请求，使用轻量模型结合上下文适配模板，实现跨语义相似任务的计划复用。

Result: 在多个真实代理应用中验证，系统平均降低46.62%成本且性能无损，显著优于传统缓存方案。

Conclusion: 计划缓存机制有效补充现有LLM服务基础设施，为基于LLM的代理应用提供了高效低成本的服务方案。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Motivation: 传统分布式LLM训练中节点故障恢复方法（检查点和冗余计算）存在高通信/计算开销且难以扩展。本文旨在通过轻量级恢复机制降低训练成本并提升模型民主化。

Method: CheckFree通过邻近阶段加权平均恢复中间阶段故障；CheckFree+扩展乱序流水线执行以支持首尾阶段恢复，通过复制相邻层权重并共享(de)embedding层实现。

Result: 在LLaMa模型（124M-1.5B参数）测试中，CheckFree+在5-10%故障率下收敛速度比基线方法快12%以上，且存储开销仅增加邻近层复制成本。

Conclusion: CheckFree系列方法通过拓扑感知的轻量级恢复机制，显著提升了分布式弱计算环境下的LLM训练效率，为去中心化训练提供了新范式。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ab initio分子动力学模拟计算成本高，机器学习力场（MLFF）虽能加速但稳定性不足。研究旨在探索预训练策略对MLFF模拟稳定性的提升效果。

Method: 使用图神经网络GemNet-T，对比两种策略：(1) 直接在MD17数据集（10K样本）训练；(2) 先在大规模OC20数据集预训练，再在MD17微调。

Result: 两种策略的力平均绝对误差（MAE）均达5 meV/Å，但预训练模型使模拟轨迹持续时间延长至三倍，表明低力误差不直接关联模拟稳定性。

Conclusion: 预训练通过捕捉大规模数据中的复杂分子交互提升模拟稳定性，力MAE不能单独作为评估指标，需结合实际模拟表现。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Motivation: 现有稀疏信号恢复方法在变量自动分组和减少系数收缩方面存在局限性。排序非凸惩罚项能结合变量聚类优势与非凸性减少偏差，但其近端算子计算困难，需开发高效算法以支持实际应用。

Method: 提出基于排序非凸惩罚项（如MCP、SCAD、Lq）的广义线性模型，针对弱凸情况（如排序MCP/SCAD）使用PAV算法精确计算近端算子；对非凸情况（如排序Lq）改进PAV算法，并分析非凸近端问题极小值的理论性质。

Result: 弱凸情况下PAV算法可精确计算近端算子，非凸情况下改进PAV算法显著提升计算效率。实验表明排序非凸惩罚项在变量聚类和减少偏差方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 排序非凸惩罚项在稀疏恢复中兼具变量分组与低偏差优势，提出的高效近端算子计算方法为实际应用提供支持，理论分析为非凸优化问题提供新见解。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

### [267] [Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding for Distributed Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15387)
*Junhui Zhang,Patrick Jaillet*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种分布式优化方法MT-GS和AMT-GS，通过多时间尺度梯度滑动框架，在非光滑目标下实现通信轮次与目标相似度的最优线性依赖，并支持异构通信速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式优化中通信效率与异构通信需求问题，突破现有方法在非光滑目标下无法实现通信轮次与目标相似度线性依赖的局限。

Method: 基于块可分解的原始对偶形式化框架，结合多时间尺度滑动方法，允许不同代理子集以自定义速率更新对偶块，实现通信-计算解耦。

Result: MT-GS需O( rA/ε)通信轮次和O( r/ε²)次梯度步；AMT-GS在强凸条件下需O( rA/√(εμ))通信和O( r/(εμ))计算，均满足ε依赖最优性及通信-A线性最优性。

Conclusion: 首次在非光滑分布式优化中实现通信轮次与目标相似度A的最优线性依赖，正面回答了Arjevani和Shamir(2015)的开放性问题。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出SimBank模拟器，用于解决Prescriptive Process Monitoring（PresPM）领域技术对比不足和评估方法有限的问题。该工具基于银行贷款流程建模，支持在线/离线方法比较，生成真实干预结果，并通过实验验证其作为公开基准测试平台的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PresPM研究存在两大局限：缺乏技术间的广泛对比和评估方法不足。现有方法无法在真实数据中生成干预后的真实结果，导致评估不全面。

Method: 开发SimBank模拟器，以银行贷款流程为模型，支持不同复杂度干预优化问题。通过模拟真实流程（含并行活动和循环），生成可观测真实干预结果，并支持因果机器学习挑战（如混杂因素鲁棒性测试）。

Result: 概念验证实验表明，SimBank能有效对比多种PresPM方法在不同干预场景下的性能，解决了传统记录数据集无法生成真实反事实结果的问题。

Conclusion: SimBank为PresPM提供了标准化、可扩展的基准测试框架，其公开可用性将推动该领域研究与实践的发展。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视障人士依赖有限的盲文书籍和公益音频资源，难以自由获取所需书籍。语音作为更高效的交互方式，亟需低成本、易用的技术解决方案。

Method: 采用光学字符识别（OCR）技术结合LabVIEW软件平台构建系统，实现文本到语音的转换。

Result: 成功开发出具备准确性、可靠性、成本效益和易用性特征的语音合成系统。

Conclusion: 该系统有效突破传统资源限制，通过声音媒介增强视障群体对文本信息的自主获取能力。

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

*Anuradha Chopra,Abhinaba Roy,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicVerse是一个多任务音乐描述模型，通过结合音乐特征检测与生成任务，提升音乐描述的细节与质量，并利用大语言模型生成长音乐片段的时序描述。

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过联合优化多任务特征检测与描述生成，有效实现了对音乐片段的多层次语义描述，为音乐AI应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.
