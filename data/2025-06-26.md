### [1] [CycleDistill: Bootstrapping Machine Translation using LLMs with Cyclical Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19952)
*Deepon Halder,Thanmay Jayakumar,Raj Dabre*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CycleDistill利用大语言模型和少量示例，通过迭代生成合成平行语料库来提升低资源语言的机器翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏平行语料库，而现有的大语言模型在机器翻译任务上表现不如专用系统。

Method: 提出CycleDistill方法，通过零样本或少量样本翻译生成合成平行语料库，并用于微调模型。

Result: 在三种印度语言上，首轮迭代平均提升20-30 chrF分数，且利用softmax激活进一步改善翻译质量。

Conclusion: CycleDistill无需大量平行语料库，仅依赖单语语料库即可显著提升低资源语言的机器翻译性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their ability to perform few-shot
machine translation (MT), often lag behind dedicated MT systems trained on
parallel corpora, which are crucial for high quality machine translation (MT).
However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach
leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.
CycleDistill involves iteratively generating synthetic parallel corpora from
monolingual corpora via zero- or few-shot MT, which is then used to fine-tune
the model that was used for generating said data for MT. CycleDistill does not
need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments
focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora,
it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot
baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration. We
also study the effect of leveraging softmax activations during the distillation
process and observe mild improvements in translation quality.

### [2] [Inference Scaled GraphRAG: Improving Multi Hop Question Answering on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19967)
*Travis Thompson,Seung-Hwan Lim,Paul Liu,Ruoying He,Dongkuan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Inference-Scaled GraphRAG框架，通过推理时计算扩展提升LLM在图推理任务中的表现，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中表现不佳，主要因为缺乏对结构化上下文和多跳信息的访问。传统RAG方法难以捕捉知识图谱中的关系结构。

Method: 提出Inference-Scaled GraphRAG框架，结合顺序扩展（深度思维链图遍历）和并行扩展（多数投票采样轨迹），在交替推理-执行循环中增强图推理能力。

Result: 在GRBench基准测试中，该方法显著提升多跳问答性能，超越传统GraphRAG和图遍历基线方法。

Conclusion: 推理时计算扩展是一种实用且架构无关的解决方案，可有效提升LLM在结构化知识推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in
language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on
knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context
and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially
mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional
RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across
nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel
framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time
compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep
chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting
over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop.
Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving
substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal
baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical
and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

### [3] [Doc2Agent: Scalable Generation of Tool-Using Agents from API Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19998)
*Xinyi Ni,Haonan Jian,Qiuyang Wang,Vedanshi Chetan Shah,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Doc2Agent提出了一种从非结构化API文档构建工具代理的可扩展方法，显著提升了性能并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的API代理依赖精心策划的工具集，无法反映真实世界API的复杂性，构建适用于任意领域的工具代理仍具挑战性。

Method: Doc2Agent通过从API文档生成可执行工具，并利用代码代理迭代优化这些工具。

Result: 在真实API、WebArena API和研究API上验证，性能提升55%，成本降低90%。糖材料科学领域的代理进一步展示了其适应性。

Conclusion: Doc2Agent为大规模从非结构化API文档构建工具代理提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: REST APIs play important roles in enriching the action space of web agents,
yet most API-based agents rely on curated and uniform toolsets that do not
reflect the complexity of real-world APIs. Building tool-using agents for
arbitrary domains remains a major challenge, as it requires reading
unstructured API documentation, testing APIs and inferring correct parameters.
We propose Doc2Agent, a scalable pipeline to build agents that can call
Python-based tools generated from API documentation. Doc2Agent generates
executable tools from API documentations and iteratively refines them using a
code agent. We evaluate our approach on real-world APIs, WebArena APIs, and
research APIs, producing validated tools. We achieved a 55\% relative
performance improvement with 90\% lower cost compared to direct API calling on
WebArena benchmark. A domain-specific agent built for glycomaterial science
further demonstrates the pipeline's adaptability to complex, knowledge-rich
tasks. Doc2Agent offers a generalizable solution for building tool agents from
unstructured API documentation at scale.

### [4] [A Modular Multitask Reasoning Framework Integrating Spatio-temporal Models and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20073)
*Kethmi Hirushini Hettige,Jiahao Ji,Cheng Long,Shili Xiang,Gao Cong,Jingyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STReason框架结合大语言模型和时空模型，通过上下文学习分解复杂查询，无需微调即可执行多任务推理，显著提升时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空数据挖掘模型局限于单一任务，缺乏多任务推理和复杂长程推理能力，难以应对现实世界多维度决策场景。

Method: 提出STReason框架，利用大语言模型的推理能力与时空模型的分析能力，通过上下文学习将自然语言查询分解为模块化程序并执行。

Result: 实验表明STReason在所有指标上显著优于先进基线模型，尤其在复杂推理密集型时空场景中表现优异，人类评估验证了其可信度与实用性。

Conclusion: STReason为开发更强大、更通用的时空推理系统提供了有前景的方向，有望减少专家工作量并扩展现实应用范围。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data mining plays a pivotal role in informed decision making
across diverse domains. However, existing models are often restricted to narrow
tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form
reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These
limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision
scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that
integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the
analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and
execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages
in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,
interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both
solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we
construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework
with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.
Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM
baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,
reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further
validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its
potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world
spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for
developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.

### [5] [SACL: Understanding and Combating Textual Bias in Code Retrieval with Semantic-Augmented Reranking and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20081)
*Dhruv Gupta,Gayathri Ganesh Lakshmy,Yiqing Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SACL框架，通过增强代码的语义信息改进检索增强的代码生成，显著提升了代码检索和生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码检索器过度依赖表面文本特征（如文档字符串、标识符名称）并对有良好文档的代码存在偏见，即使文档不相关。这限制了代码检索和生成的效果。

Method: 提出SACL框架，通过系统性地掩盖特定特征同时保留代码功能，分析代码检索问题，并增强代码或结构知识的语义信息以减少偏见。

Result: SACL显著提高了代码检索性能（如HumanEval上Recall@1提升12.8%），并改善了代码生成效果（如HumanEval上Pass@1提升4.88%）。

Conclusion: SACL框架通过增强语义信息和减少偏见，有效提升了代码检索和生成的性能，为检索增强的代码生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) is a critical technique for
enhancing code generation by retrieving relevant information. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of code retrieval by systematically masking
specific features while preserving code functionality. Our discoveries include:
(1) although trained on code, current retrievers heavily rely on surface-level
textual features (e.g., docstrings, identifier names), and (2) they exhibit a
strong bias towards well-documented code, even if the documentation is
irrelevant.Based on our discoveries, we propose SACL, a framework that enriches
textual information and reduces bias by augmenting code or structural knowledge
with semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SACL substantially
improves code retrieval (e.g., by 12.8% / 9.4% / 7.0% Recall@1 on HumanEval /
MBPP / SWE-Bench-Lite), which also leads to better code generation performance
(e.g., by 4.88% Pass@1 on HumanEval).

### [6] [Bridging Compositional and Distributional Semantics: A Survey on Latent Semantic Geometry via AutoEncoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20083)
*Yingji Zhang,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过组合语义增强Transformer自回归语言模型的可解释性和泛化能力，比较了三种自编码器架构的潜在空间几何特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分布语义空间缺乏组合性和符号性，限制了语言模型的可解释性和可控性。论文旨在通过组合语义视角弥合符号语义与分布语义之间的鸿沟。

Method: 论文综述并比较了三种自编码器架构：变分自编码器(VAE)、矢量量化VAE(VQVAE)和稀疏自编码器(SAE)，分析它们对语义结构和可解释性的影响。

Result: 研究发现不同自编码器架构会诱导出不同的潜在几何特性，这些特性与语义结构和模型可解释性密切相关。

Conclusion: 组合语义表示学习为增强语言模型性能提供了新方向，未来可进一步探索符号与分布语义的融合。

Abstract: Integrating compositional and symbolic properties into current distributional
semantic spaces can enhance the interpretability, controllability,
compositionality, and generalisation capabilities of Transformer-based
auto-regressive language models (LMs). In this survey, we offer a novel
perspective on latent space geometry through the lens of compositional
semantics, a direction we refer to as \textit{semantic representation
learning}. This direction enables a bridge between symbolic and distributional
semantics, helping to mitigate the gap between them. We review and compare
three mainstream autoencoder architectures-Variational AutoEncoder (VAE),
Vector Quantised VAE (VQVAE), and Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-and examine the
distinctive latent geometries they induce in relation to semantic structure and
interpretability.

*Yilin Wang,Peixuan Lei,Jie Song,Yuzhe Hao,Tao Chen,Yuxuan Zhang,Lei Jia,Yuanxiang Li,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个大规模时序-文本问答数据集EngineMT-QA和新框架ITFormer，以高效融合时序信号与自然语言，显著提升问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维时序信号与自然语言的动态交互存在挑战，需开发新方法实现跨模态融合。

Method: 基于EngineMT-QA数据集，设计ITFormer框架，通过时序编码器与冻结LLMs的特征对齐与融合实现多模态建模。

Result: ITFormer以少于1%的可训练参数量，在QA准确率上显著超越基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为时序数据与自然语言集成提供了高效范式，推动了多模态AI的新应用。

Abstract: Time-series data are critical in diverse applications, such as industrial
monitoring, medical diagnostics, and climate research. However, effectively
integrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for
dynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release
EngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset
designed to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and
natural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time
Transformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders
with frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,
aligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement
in QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\% additional trainable
parameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal
modeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal
data with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in
multi-modal AI. More details about the project, including datasets and code,
are available at: https://pandalin98.github.io/itformer_site/

### [8] [A Multi-Pass Large Language Model Framework for Precise and Efficient Radiology Report Error Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20112)
*Songsoo Kim,Seungtae Lee,See Young Lee,Joonho Kim,Keechan Kan,Dukyong Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 三阶段LLM框架显著提升放射报告校对阳性预测值并降低42.6%成本，同时保持错误检测率稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型(LLM)的放射报告校对因错误率低导致阳性预测值(PPV)有限，需开发更高效框架。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM流程（提取器+检测器+误报验证器），在MIMIC-III等数据集上对比单/双阶段框架，通过统计检验评估性能与成本。

Result: 三阶段框架PPV提升至0.159（较基线提升152%），每千份报告成本降至5.58美元，人工审核量减少54%，外部数据集验证效果一致。

Conclusion: 三阶段LLM框架为AI辅助放射报告质控提供了PPV与成本效益双优的解决方案。

Abstract: Background: The positive predictive value (PPV) of large language model
(LLM)-based proofreading for radiology reports is limited due to the low error
prevalence. Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV
and reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology
reports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III
database. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.
Three LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor
plus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.
Precision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).
Efficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer
remuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,
exact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV
increased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,
Framework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.
baselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per
1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and
USD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.
Human-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported
Framework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR
(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and
reduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an
effective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.

### [9] [Leveraging AI Graders for Missing Score Imputation to Achieve Accurate Ability Estimation in Constructed-Response Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20119)
*Masaki Uto,Yuma Ito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用自动评分技术填补缺失分数的新方法，以提高基于IRT的能力评估准确性，同时显著减少人工评分工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育领域，评估学习者的高阶能力（如表达能力和逻辑思维）需求日益增长。虽然构建性回答测试（如简答题和论述题）被广泛使用，但其人工评分过程耗时且成本高昂。IRT理论虽能从不完整评分数据中估计能力，但随着缺失分数的增加，准确性下降。现有数据增强技术在处理稀疏或异构数据时效果不佳，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 本研究提出了一种新颖的方法，通过利用自动评分技术来填补缺失分数，以提高基于IRT的能力评估准确性。该方法结合了自动评分和IRT理论，优化了缺失分数的填补过程。

Result: 所提出的方法在能力评估中实现了高准确性，同时显著减少了人工评分的工作量。实验表明，该方法在处理稀疏或异构数据时表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合自动评分技术和IRT理论，提出了一种高效且准确的能力评估方法，不仅提高了评估的准确性，还大幅降低了人工评分的负担，为教育评估领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of learners is a fundamental objective in the field
of education. In particular, there is an increasing need to assess higher-order
abilities such as expressive skills and logical thinking. Constructed-response
tests such as short-answer and essay-based questions have become widely used as
a method to meet this demand. Although these tests are effective, they require
substantial manual grading, making them both labor-intensive and costly. Item
response theory (IRT) provides a promising solution by enabling the estimation
of ability from incomplete score data, where human raters grade only a subset
of answers provided by learners across multiple test items. However, the
accuracy of ability estimation declines as the proportion of missing scores
increases. Although data augmentation techniques for imputing missing scores
have been explored in order to address this limitation, they often struggle
with inaccuracy for sparse or heterogeneous data. To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel method for imputing missing scores by leveraging
automated scoring technologies for accurate IRT-based ability estimation. The
proposed method achieves high accuracy in ability estimation while markedly
reducing manual grading workload.

### [10] [CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20128)
*Aashiq Muhamed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CCRS评估框架，利用单一预训练大模型作为零样本端到端评判器，高效评估RAG系统的多维质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG评估方法依赖简单词汇重叠指标或复杂多阶段流程，难以全面捕捉输出质量且效率低下。

Method: 提出CCRS五维指标（上下文连贯性、问题相关性等），基于单一预训练LLM进行零样本端到端评估。

Result: 在BioASQ数据集上验证CCRS能有效区分系统性能（如Mistral-7B优于Llama），且比RAGChecker框架更高效。

Conclusion: CCRS为RAG系统提供了实用、全面、高效的评估框架，支持迭代改进。

Abstract: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is
crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.
However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects
such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and
informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation
methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for
capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with
intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized
judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five
metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,
end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance
(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall
(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the
challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively
discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the
Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of
CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant
validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared
to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior
discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being
significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,
comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving
RAG systems.

### [11] [AALC: Large Language Model Efficient Reasoning via Adaptive Accuracy-Length Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20160)
*Ruosen Li,Ziming Luo,Quan Zhang,Ruochen Li,Ben Zhou,Ali Payani,Xinya Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出AALC方法，通过动态平衡正确性和简洁性的强化学习奖励机制，显著减少大模型推理长度同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）通过生成冗长的思维链实现推理，但这种方式导致高延迟和成本，且准确性提升有限。

Method: 引入AALC，一种轻量级的、准确性感知的长度奖励机制，结合验证准确性和动态调度的长度惩罚，延迟长度惩罚直到达到目标性能。

Result: 实验表明，AALC在标准和非分布数学基准测试中，将响应长度减少50%以上，同时保持或提高原始准确性。

Conclusion: AALC通过奖励策略引导LRMs生成更高效、通用的推理路径，但效率提升伴随可解释性降低。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve impressive reasoning capabilities by
generating lengthy chain-of-thoughts, but this "overthinking" incurs high
latency and cost without commensurate accuracy gains. In this work, we
introduce AALC, a lightweight, accuracy-aware length reward integrated into
reinforcement learning that dynamically balances correctness and brevity during
training. By incorporating validation accuracy into the reward and employing a
smooth, dynamically scheduled length penalty, AALC delays length penalty until
target performance is met. Through extensive experiments across standard and
out-of-distribution math benchmarks, we show that our approach reduces response
length by over 50% while maintaining or even improving the original accuracy.
Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that our method curbs redundant
reasoning patterns such as excessive subgoal setting and verification, leading
to structurally refined outputs rather than naive truncation. We also identify
that efficiency gains are accompanied by reduced interpretability: models
trained with AALC omit some narrative framing and explanatory context. These
findings highlight the potential of reward-based strategies to guide LRMs
toward more efficient, generalizable reasoning paths.

### [12] [SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20167)
*Fengze Li,Yue Wang,Yangle Liu,Ming Huang,Dou Hong,Jieming Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEED模型通过结合结构编码器和语言模型，解决了多元时间序列预测中结构依赖与语义推理的融合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构编码器无法进行语义级推理或任务适应，而大型语言模型虽具备强大泛化能力却无法直接处理原始时间序列数据，这限制了统一、可迁移预测系统的发展。

Method: SEED模型包含四个阶段：用于补丁提取的令牌感知编码器、将补丁与语言模型嵌入对齐的投影模块、将补丁映射到任务感知原型的语义重编程机制，以及用于预测的冻结语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上均优于强基线模型，有效填补了结构-语义建模的空白。

Conclusion: SEED通过模块化架构解耦表示学习与推理，实现了数值模式与语义推理的高效对齐，为多元时间序列预测提供了统一且可迁移的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.

### [13] [COIN: Uncertainty-Guarding Selective Question Answering for Foundation Models with Provable Risk Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20178)
*Zhiyuan Wang,Jinhao Duan,Qingni Wang,Xiaofeng Zhu,Tianlong Chen,Xiaoshuang Shi,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIN框架通过统计校准控制错误发现率，提升生成文本的可靠性和保留率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法缺乏对选择性预测中错误发现率（FDR）的形式化保证，导致预测集可能包含错误答案，实用性受限。

Method: 提出COIN框架，通过校准统计有效阈值，在用户指定的FDR约束下筛选单个生成答案，并利用置信区间方法控制真实错误率上限。

Result: COIN在风险控制、保留合格答案的测试能力及有限校准数据下的预测效率方面表现优异，且可通过不同上限构造和UQ策略进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: COIN框架具有可扩展性和适应性，能有效应对多样化应用场景中的不确定性量化需求。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for foundation models is essential to
identify and mitigate potential hallucinations in automatically generated text.
However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as
the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts
the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of
admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often
contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address
this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that
calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer
per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical
error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as
Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error
rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty
threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing
sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong
test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency
under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text
generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound
constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,
which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application

*Mengqi Wang,Tiantian Feng,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过上下文学习（ICL）中的高质量示例检索来提升大语言模型（LLM）在对话情感识别（CER）中的表现，发现增强示例检索方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在多个领域有广泛应用，但在主观任务（如情感识别）中实现高精度仍具挑战性。受SLT 2024 GenSER挑战赛启发，本研究旨在提升对话情感识别（CER）的准确性。

Method: 研究提出了基于随机和增强示例检索的策略，并分析了对话上下文对CER准确性的影响。实验在IEMOCAP、MELD和EmoryNLP三个数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，增强示例检索方法在所有数据集中均优于其他技术，突显了检索具有一致性的目标示例并通过改写增强其质量的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过增强示例检索方法，可以有效提升大语言模型在对话情感识别任务中的表现，为相关应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a wide variety of real-world
applications in various domains. However, creating a high-performing
application with high accuracy remains challenging, particularly for subjective
tasks like emotion recognition. Inspired by the SLT 2024 GenSER Challenge, this
study investigates approaches to improving conversational emotion recognition
(CER) by LLMs. Specifically, we explore how to retrieve high-quality examples
in in-context learning (ICL) to enhance CER. We propose various strategies
based on random and augmented example retrieval and also analyze the impact of
conversational context on CER accuracy. Experiments were conducted on the three
datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD and EmoryNLP. The results show that augmented
example retrieval consistently outperforms other techniques under investigation
across all datasets, highlighting the importance of retrieving coherent
targeted examples and enhancing them through paraphrasing.

*Petra Barančíková,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文比较了捷克语特定和多语言句子嵌入模型，发现内在语义相似性表现优异的模型在下游翻译任务中未必表现最佳，反之亦然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索句子嵌入模型在捕获语言现象（如语义相似性、时间方面和风格变化）方面的能力，并评估其在下游任务（如机器翻译评估）中的实际表现。

Method: 研究方法包括内在评估（使用Costra数据集和STS基准）和外在评估（通过COMET指标微调模型进行机器翻译评估）。

Result: 实验结果显示，内在语义相似性表现优异的模型在下游任务中表现不一致，而某些看似过度平滑的嵌入模型通过微调却能取得优异结果。

Conclusion: 结论强调语义属性探测与下游任务之间的复杂关系，呼吁进一步研究句子嵌入中的‘可操作语义’或更深入的下游任务数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare Czech-specific and multilingual sentence embedding
models through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation paradigms. For intrinsic
evaluation, we employ Costra, a complex sentence transformation dataset, and
several Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks to assess the ability of
the embeddings to capture linguistic phenomena such as semantic similarity,
temporal aspects, and stylistic variations. In the extrinsic evaluation, we
fine-tune each embedding model using COMET-based metrics for machine
translation evaluation.
  Our experiments reveal an interesting disconnect: models that excel in
intrinsic semantic similarity tests do not consistently yield superior
performance on downstream translation evaluation tasks. Conversely, models with
seemingly over-smoothed embedding spaces can, through fine-tuning, achieve
excellent results. These findings highlight the complex relationship between
semantic property probes and downstream task, emphasizing the need for more
research into 'operationalizable semantics' in sentence embeddings, or more
in-depth downstream tasks datasets (here translation evaluation)

*Benedetta Muscato,Lucia Passaro,Gizem Gezici,Fosca Giannotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多视角的软标签方法，以更好地捕捉人类标注者的多样性观点，在主观文本分类任务中表现优于传统聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP方法通过聚合标注者观点生成单一标准答案，但忽视了少数派观点，尤其在主观任务中可能导致偏见。论文认为标签应反映个体背景和价值观的多样性。

Method: 采用多视角软标签方法，在仇恨言论、反讽、辱骂性语言和立场检测等主观分类任务中进行分析，并利用可解释AI（XAI）探索模型不确定性。

Result: 多视角方法在Jensen-Shannon散度（JSD）和F1分数上均优于传统方法，但在反讽和立场检测任务中置信度较低，可能与文本内在主观性有关。

Conclusion: 多视角建模能更包容地反映人类分歧，推动构建更具多元意识的下一代NLP模型，但需进一步解决高主观性任务中的不确定性挑战。

Abstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for
handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to
establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding
individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting
minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may
systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels
reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals,
this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to
encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models,
more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse
subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive
language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human
disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results
show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human
label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also
achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming
traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in
tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity
present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model
uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过结构化推理增强大语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，结合监督微调和优化算法，显著提升了模型的推理能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂逻辑推理和系统规划任务中表现不佳，主要依赖隐式统计关系而缺乏结构化知识表示。受认知科学和神经符号AI启发，作者希望通过显式结构化推理来改进这一问题。

Method: 方法包括：1）将非结构化数据转换为带推理步骤标注的结构化数据；2）通过监督微调（SFT）训练LLMs；3）使用GRPO优化算法（MAX-Flow和LCS）增强结构化推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B模型的微调实现了简洁推理、场景鲁棒性，并提升了与优化技术的兼容性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理的集成有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，验证了该方法在增强模型性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural
language processing and automated decision-making. However, these models still
encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving
logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on
implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge
representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce
a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First,
we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating
reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning
capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common
Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce
computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust
performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with
optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning
integration in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块的自监督学习融合方法，用于非母语者的流利度评估，显著提升了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动流利度评估在捕捉非母语者的语音节奏、停顿和不流畅性方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 结合多种自监督学习模型（Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、WavLM），采用分块策略和CNN-BiLSTM框架，融合声学和语言特征。

Result: 在Speechocean762和Avalinguo数据集上，F1分数和Pearson相关系数均有显著提升，超越了基线方法。

Conclusion: 分块多自监督学习融合方法在流利度评估中表现优异，未来需进一步探索其在非规则韵律方言中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Automatic fluency assessment (AFA) remains challenging, particularly in
capturing speech rhythm, pauses, and disfluencies in non-native speakers. We
introduce a chunk-based approach integrating self-supervised learning (SSL)
models (Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) selected for their complementary strengths
in phonetic, prosodic, and noisy speech modeling, with a hierarchical
CNN-BiLSTM framework. Speech is segmented into breath-group chunks using Silero
voice activity detection (Silero-VAD), enabling fine-grained temporal analysis
while mitigating over-segmentation artifacts. SSL embeddings are fused via a
learnable weighted mechanism, balancing acoustic and linguistic features, and
enriched with chunk-level fluency markers (e.g., speech rate, pause durations,
n-gram repetitions). The CNN-BiLSTM captures local and long-term dependencies
across chunks. Evaluated on Avalinguo and Speechocean762, our approach improves
F1-score by 2.8 and Pearson correlation by 6.2 points over single SSL baselines
on Speechocean762, with gains of 4.2 F1-score and 4.0 Pearson points on
Avalinguo, surpassing Pyannote.audio-based segmentation baselines. These
findings highlight chunk-based multi-SSL fusion for robust fluency evaluation,
though future work should explore generalization to dialects with irregular
prosody.

*Kai-Robin Lange,Tobias Schmidt,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型和主题模型的方法，用于动态追踪和分析媒体叙事随时间的变化，并在《华尔街日报》2009-2023年的文章上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着媒体叙事的快速演变，仅从给定语料库中提取叙事已不足以满足需求，研究叙事的动态变化变得尤为重要。大型语言模型虽能捕捉叙事的复杂结构，但在整个语料库上应用时面临高昂的成本和计算难题。

Method: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型的语言理解能力和主题模型的大规模应用性的方法，利用叙事政策框架动态建模叙事变化。具体步骤包括应用主题模型和变化点检测方法识别特定主题的变化，筛选代表性文档，再通过大型语言模型自动解释变化并区分内容变化与叙事变化。

Result: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型能有效提取特定时间点的叙事变化，但在区分内容变化与叙事变化方面的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 结合大型语言模型和主题模型的方法能有效追踪叙事变化，但在区分内容变化与叙事变化方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: With rapidly evolving media narratives, it has become increasingly critical
to not just extract narratives from a given corpus but rather investigate, how
they develop over time. While popular narrative extraction methods such as
Large Language Models do well in capturing typical narrative elements or even
the complex structure of a narrative, applying them to an entire corpus comes
with obstacles, such as a high financial or computational cost. We propose a
combination of the language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models
with the large scale applicability of topic models to dynamically model
narrative shifts across time using the Narrative Policy Framework. We apply a
topic model and a corresponding change point detection method to find changes
that concern a specific topic of interest. Using this model, we filter our
corpus for documents that are particularly representative of that change and
feed them into a Large Language Model that interprets the change that happened
in an automated fashion and distinguishes between content and narrative shifts.
We employ our pipeline on a corpus of The Wall Street Journal news paper
articles from 2009 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a Large Language Model
can efficiently extract a narrative shift if one exists at a given point in
time, but does not perform as well when having to decide whether a shift in
content or a narrative shift took place.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Biomed-Enriched是一个通过两阶段标注过程从PubMed构建的生物医学文本数据集，包含大量临床案例段落，用于生物医学和临床NLP研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本通常因隐私限制难以获取，因此需要构建一个大规模、公开可用的临床案例数据集，以支持生物医学和临床NLP研究。

Method: 通过大语言模型标注PubMed科学文章的段落，然后使用小语言模型将标签传播到整个PMC-OA语料库，最终提取精炼的子集。

Result: 数据集包含200万临床案例段落，其中45万高质量段落，初步实验显示这些子集能提升模型在生物医学任务上的性能。

Conclusion: Biomed-Enriched数据集为生物医学和临床NLP提供了有价值的资源，并通过质量过滤和领域上采样等技术提升了模型训练的效率和效果。

Abstract: We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from
PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language
model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning
scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,
biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score
(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.
These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which
propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata
allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs
with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,
and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.
Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as
hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an
alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from
PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.
Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated
subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting
performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving
MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster
convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,
indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining
strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的大型语言模型在个性化工具使用方面存在不足，忽视了用户偏好在指导工具使用中的作用。

Method: 引入TAPS，结合结构化标记工具和基于不确定性的工具检测器，以增强个性化工具使用。

Result: TAPS显著提升了大型语言模型整合用户偏好的能力，在NLSI任务上达到了开源模型的新最佳水平。

Conclusion: TAPS通过个性化工具使用的创新方法，为大型语言模型在目标导向对话代理中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in tool-augmented large language models have enabled them
to interact with external tools, enhancing their ability to perform complex
user tasks. However, existing approaches overlook the role of personalisation
in guiding tool use. This work investigates how user preferences can be
effectively integrated into goal-oriented dialogue agents. Through extensive
analysis, we identify key weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to personalise tool
use. To this end, we introduce \name, a novel solution that enhances
personalised tool use by leveraging a structured tagging tool and an
uncertainty-based tool detector. TAPS significantly improves the ability of
LLMs to incorporate user preferences, achieving the new state-of-the-art for
open source models on the NLSI task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病影响全球超过3亿人，但由于临床异质性、低个体患病率和医生对罕见病的有限了解，及时准确诊断仍具挑战性。

Method: DeepRare系统由中央主机和长期记忆模块、专业代理服务器组成，整合40多种专业工具和最新医学知识源，支持复杂诊断推理。

Result: 在8个数据集上评估，DeepRare在2919种疾病中表现卓越，对1013种疾病达到100%准确率，显著优于其他15种方法，临床专家验证推理链一致性达95.40%。

Conclusion: DeepRare作为首个罕见病诊断代理系统，展示了卓越的诊断性能和透明度，已实现为易用的网络应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet
timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely
due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited
familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce
DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large
language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The
system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each
accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate
analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term
memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific
analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale,
up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current
clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex
diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We
evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional
diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013
diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15
methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other
agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing
the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79
percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at
Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of
reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore,
the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application

TL;DR: 论文提出Code of Thought (CoDoT)方法，揭示当前大语言模型在安全性上的严重不足，需从第一性原理重新评估安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在安全关键场景的广泛应用，其能力提升必须与安全对齐人类价值观同步。研究发现现有模型存在显著安全隐患，亟需系统性评估方法。

Method: 提出CoDoT提示策略：将自然语言指令转换为等价的简单代码形式（如将'使文本更具毒性'转为make_more_toxic()函数），通过代码化表达检测模型安全漏洞。

Result: 测试显示：GPT-4 Turbo毒性输出增加16.5倍，DeepSeek R1失败率100%，7个主流模型平均毒性上升300%。递归使用CoDoT可使毒性再翻倍。

Conclusion: CoDoT暴露了现有安全措施的脆弱性，强调必须从底层原理重构安全评估体系，实现模型能力与安全性的协同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, interfacing with humans
in numerous safety-critical applications. This necessitates improving
capabilities, but importantly coupled with greater safety measures to align
these models with human values and preferences. In this work, we demonstrate
that contemporary models fall concerningly short of the goal of AI safety,
leading to an unsafe and harmful experience for users. We introduce a prompting
strategy called Code of Thought (CoDoT) to evaluate the safety of LLMs. CoDoT
converts natural language inputs to simple code that represents the same
intent. For instance, CoDoT transforms the natural language prompt "Make the
statement more toxic: {text}" to: "make_more_toxic({text})". We show that CoDoT
results in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For
example, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of
the time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.
Additionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two
times. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the
critical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that
safety and capabilities advance together.

<details>

Motivation: 研究对话中发言时间的分配及其动态过程，以理解不同分配方式如何影响参与者的感知，并为通信平台设计提供新工具。

Method: 引入一个计算框架，量化对话级别的发言时间分配及其底层动态，并通过大型视频聊天数据集验证框架的有效性。

Result: 平衡的对话更受欢迎，尤其是发言较少的一方；即使整体平衡相同，不同的发言时间动态也会影响参与者的感知。

Conclusion: 该框架为通信平台设计提供了新工具，适用于人-人和人-机通信场景。

Abstract: An intrinsic aspect of every conversation is the way talk-time is shared
between multiple speakers. Conversations can be balanced, with each speaker
claiming a similar amount of talk-time, or imbalanced when one talks
disproportionately. Such overall distributions are the consequence of
continuous negotiations between the speakers throughout the conversation: who
should be talking at every point in time, and for how long?
  In this work we introduce a computational framework for quantifying both the
conversation-level distribution of talk-time between speakers, as well as the
lower-level dynamics that lead to it. We derive a typology of talk-time sharing
dynamics structured by several intuitive axes of variation. By applying this
framework to a large dataset of video-chats between strangers, we confirm that,
perhaps unsurprisingly, different conversation-level distributions of talk-time
are perceived differently by speakers, with balanced conversations being
preferred over imbalanced ones, especially by those who end up talking less.
Then we reveal that -- even when they lead to the same level of overall balance
-- different types of talk-time sharing dynamics are perceived differently by
the participants, highlighting the relevance of our newly introduced typology.
Finally, we discuss how our framework offers new tools to designers of
computer-mediated communication platforms, for both human-human and human-AI
communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过合并微调模型层来压缩大语言模型的新方法，在保持性能的同时减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能力强，但模型体积大，部署和推理成本高。现有剪枝方法主要针对单一模型，无法充分利用不同微调模型的优势。

Method: 将模型压缩建模为零阶优化问题，支持三种操作：层移除、跨模型层选择和层合并，通过策略性组合不同微调模型的层来实现压缩。

Result: 在Llama2-13B模型上，压缩后模型参数减少25%，性能保持原模型的97.3%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能合并不同微调模型的层，实现了高效的大模型压缩，为实际部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically
comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in
deployment and inference. While structured pruning of model parameters offers a
promising way to reduce computational costs at deployment time, current methods
primarily focus on single model pruning. In this work, we develop a novel
strategy to compress models by strategically combining or merging layers from
finetuned model variants, which preserves the original model's abilities by
aggregating capabilities accentuated in different finetunes. We pose the
optimal tailoring of these LLMs as a zero-order optimization problem, adopting
a search space that supports three different operations: (1) Layer removal, (2)
Layer selection from different candidate models, and (3) Layer merging. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach leads to competitive model pruning,
for example, for the Llama2-13B model families, our compressed models maintain
approximately 97.3\% of the original performance while removing $\sim25\%$ of
parameters, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在代码生成方面表现出色，但在适应外部库API频繁更新时表现不佳，这限制了其在动态环境中的可靠性。

Method: 提出ReCode框架，构建数据集训练模型适应API变化，引入改进的字符串相似度指标作为强化学习的奖励。

Result: ReCode显著提升模型在动态API场景中的性能，尤其在未见过的CodeUpdateArena任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: ReCode有效提升大语言模型在动态API环境中的适应性，同时保持其通用代码生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities
but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This
critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from
their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes
reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we
propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel
framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically,
we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to
perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a
modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for
reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially
boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially
on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised
fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.
We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and
DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training,
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned
model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at

Abstract: Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit
divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),
especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model
suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question
is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next
generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL
dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our
study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as
MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,
while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further
adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this
effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce
verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the
importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to
stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a
two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are
first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B
tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields
OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and
closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.
We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models
in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models
along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens
(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在多语言、多任务环境下如何有效扩展推理时计算，提出了针对性的采样和选择策略，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）的研究主要集中在英语及少数领域（如数学和代码），缺乏对多语言、多任务环境下推理时计算扩展的探索。作者旨在开发适用于开放生成任务、可验证任务及多语言场景的通用技术。

Method: 论文提出新颖的采样和选择策略，特别针对多语言和多任务推理场景进行了优化。这些策略考虑了温度变化和语言多样性，并对现有选择方法进行了评估和改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法在8B模型上平均提升了6.8%的胜率（m-ArenaHard-v2.0基准），111B模型（Command-A）在仅使用五个样本的情况下胜率提升了9.0%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在推理时计算中考虑语言和任务特性的重要性，为提升非主流语言性能提供了有效方法，推动了性能改进的民主化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward
scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the
model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select
one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English
and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most
interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally
verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly
scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,
multi-task setting.
  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation
and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and
varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing
that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.
We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for
multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable
gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and
selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models
on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At
larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0
improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against
single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results
underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time
compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented
languages.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为行为编辑（Behavior Editing）的方法，用于高效引导基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理的伦理行为，并通过多层级基准BehaviorBench评估其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域部署基于LLM的代理存在安全和伦理风险，其不道德行为可能导致严重的现实后果，如人身伤害和经济损失。因此，需要一种方法来有效引导代理的伦理行为。

Method: 将代理行为引导任务建模为模型编辑任务，提出行为编辑方法，并引入基于心理学道德理论的多层级基准BehaviorBench，支持跨场景的行为评估和编辑。

Result: 行为编辑能够在特定场景中动态引导代理行为，不仅支持局部调整，还能改变代理的全局道德倾向，既能促进伦理行为，也可能诱导有害行为。

Conclusion: 行为编辑为代理行为引导提供了新范式，展示了其潜力与风险，为未来研究提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents
in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.
Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world
consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer
the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model
editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area
of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while
preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate
this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in
psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and
editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier
introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that
Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within
specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only
scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an
agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be
used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce
harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents
based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior
Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights
into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise
and perils of Behavior Editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffuCoder是一个7B参数的扩散大语言模型，用于代码生成，通过系统性研究其去噪过程和强化学习方法，提升了性能并减少了对自回归解码的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）因其全局规划和迭代优化特性在代码生成中具有潜力，但当前训练和推理机制尚不成熟，需要深入研究其解码行为和强化学习方法。

Method: 训练了一个7B参数的dLLM模型DiffuCoder，分析了其解码行为，并提出了一种新的采样方案coupled-GRPO，用于降低token对数似然估计的方差并保持训练效率。

Result: 实验表明，coupled-GRPO显著提升了DiffuCoder在代码生成基准上的性能（EvalPlus上+4.4%），并减少了解码时对自回归因果的依赖。

Conclusion: 本研究深入揭示了dLLM的生成机制，并提供了一个高效的、扩散原生的强化学习训练框架，为代码生成领域提供了新的见解和方法。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to
autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the
entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs
are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and
inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify
the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we
systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning
(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.
Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how
it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their
generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing
the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their
generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.
For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and
maintain training efficiency, we propose \textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel
sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used
in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves
DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and
reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight
into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native
RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

TL;DR: Memento是一种新的提示策略，通过分解问题、动态构建事实数据库并整合信息，显著提升了LLMs在多跳问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在纯推理任务中表现优异，但在需要推理与检索紧密结合的任务（如多跳问答）中表现不佳。为了克服这一局限，研究者提出了Memento策略。

Method: Memento采用三阶段策略：1) 将复杂问题分解为小步骤；2) 使用LLMs动态构建事实数据库；3) 整合这些事实以解决问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Memento显著提升了性能：在PhantomWiki上性能翻倍，在2WikiMultiHopQA上比CoT-RAG提升20 F1点，在MuSiQue上比ReAct提升3 F1点。

Conclusion: Memento策略有效提升了LLMs在多跳问答任务中的性能，展示了其在复杂推理与检索结合任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning-only tasks, but struggle when
reasoning must be tightly coupled with retrieval, as in multi-hop question
answering. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a prompting strategy
that first decomposes a complex question into smaller steps, then dynamically
constructs a database of facts using LLMs, and finally pieces these facts
together to solve the question. We show how this three-stage strategy, which we
call Memento, can boost the performance of existing prompting strategies across
diverse settings. On the 9-step PhantomWiki benchmark, Memento doubles the
performance of chain-of-thought (CoT) when all information is provided in
context. On the open-domain version of 2WikiMultiHopQA, CoT-RAG with Memento
improves over vanilla CoT-RAG by more than 20 F1 percentage points and over the
multi-hop RAG baseline, IRCoT, by more than 13 F1 percentage points. On the
challenging MuSiQue dataset, Memento improves ReAct by more than 3 F1
percentage points, demonstrating its utility in agentic settings.

TL;DR: 该研究利用认知科学中的礼貌言语模型，评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在价值权衡方面与人类相似的程度，揭示了模型在信息效用与社会效用之间的差异及其训练动态的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具在解释大型语言模型（LLMs）中动态且多方面的价值观念方面存在局限，尤其是在处理如传达严酷事实、维护信任和顾及他人感受等多重目标时的价值权衡问题。

Method: 研究采用了一种领先的礼貌言语认知模型，系统地评估了两种模型设置下的价值权衡：前沿黑盒模型中的推理“努力”程度，以及开源模型的强化学习（RL）后训练动态。

Result: 研究发现，推理模型在信息效用上高于社会效用，而数学推理能力较强的开源模型也显示出类似的趋势。训练动态分析表明，训练早期价值效用发生显著变化，且基础模型和预训练数据的选择对结果有持续影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能够响应快速发展的LLM景观的多样化方面，为形成关于其他高级行为的假设、塑造推理模型的训练机制以及在模型训练中更好地控制价值权衡提供了见解。

Abstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting
goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still
being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an
integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools
for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are
limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal
accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a
speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In
this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the
extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to
systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:
degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL
post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of
higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in
open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings
from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in
training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining
data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method
is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with
insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping
training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs
between values during model training.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应平衡探索与利用，显著提升了查询效率，同时保持了高归因保真度，优于传统的基于扰动的归因方法。

Abstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large
language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and
trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates
context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each
context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial
Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of
context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward
function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of
segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional
perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets
uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances
exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment
relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while
maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution
quality with fewer model queries.

Abstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical
implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems
for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and
safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2
emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various
open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like
llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs
performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs
o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.
Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy
consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy
(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and
DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption
and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a
total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x
times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while
maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs
can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in
medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular
framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and
aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

Motivation: 人类推理常因身份保护等动机产生偏见，影响理性决策。研究探讨大语言模型是否也会因角色设定出现类似动机性推理，尤其是在气候变迁、疫苗安全等敏感议题上可能加剧社会分歧。

Method: 为8个大语言模型（开源/商用）赋予4类政治/社会身份角色，测试其在两类人类研究任务中的表现：虚假新闻标题真实性判断、枪支管控科学数据评估。

Result: 角色设定使模型事实辨别准确率下降9%；政治身份与事实相符时，科学证据评估准确率提升90%；现有提示去偏方法基本无效。

Conclusion: 大语言模型表现出难以通过常规方法消除的人类式动机性推理，可能强化身份认同导致的认知偏差，需警惕其对人类社会的潜在影响。

Abstract: Reasoning in humans is prone to biases due to underlying motivations like
identity protection, that undermine rational decision-making and judgment. This
motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when
debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,
and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported
that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive
biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward
identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate
whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic
attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and
proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity
discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific
evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity
discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas
specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific
evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced
political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at
mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first
to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning
that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising
concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.

Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型忽视电子健康记录（EHR）的作用，且主要关注诊断推荐，限制了其临床应用。

Conclusion: DiaLLM通过整合EHR数据和优化诊断流程，显著提升了医疗大语言模型的临床适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the
essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on
diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose
DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into
clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result
interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world
medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we
design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to
its corresponding description and classifies test results as "normal" or
"abnormal". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for
evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space,
we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a
class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms

TL;DR: OpenPub是一个AI驱动的平台，通过其Reproducibility Copilot模块，帮助研究人员、审稿人和读者提高研究的可重复性，显著减少重复实验时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放科学倡议旨在使研究成果更加透明、可访问和可重用，但确保已发表的研究结果能够独立复现仍然是一个持续的挑战。

Method: OpenPub平台引入了Reproducibility Copilot，通过分析手稿、代码和补充材料，生成结构化的Jupyter Notebook和建议，以促进计算或“机械”可重复性。

Result: 测试表明，OpenPub可以将复现时间从30多小时减少到约1小时，同时实现高覆盖率的图表、表格和结果，适合计算复现。系统还能系统性地检测可重复性障碍。

Conclusion: AI驱动的工具可以显著减轻可重复性工作的负担，有助于更透明和可验证的科学交流。模块化的copilot架构还为扩展到其他开放科学目标奠定了基础。

Abstract: Open science initiatives seek to make research outputs more transparent,
accessible, and reusable, but ensuring that published findings can be
independently reproduced remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces
OpenPub, an AI-powered platform that supports researchers, reviewers, and
readers through a suite of modular copilots focused on key open science tasks.
In this work, we present the Reproducibility Copilot, which analyzes
manuscripts, code, and supplementary materials to generate structured Jupyter
Notebooks and recommendations aimed at facilitating computational, or "rote",
reproducibility. We conducted feasibility tests using previously studied
research papers with known reproducibility benchmarks. Results indicate that
OpenPub can substantially reduce reproduction time - from over 30 hours to
about 1 hour - while achieving high coverage of figures, tables, and results
suitable for computational reproduction. The system systematically detects
barriers to reproducibility, including missing hyperparameters, undocumented
preprocessing steps, and incomplete or inaccessible datasets. These findings
suggest that AI-driven tools can meaningfully reduce the burden of
reproducibility efforts and contribute to more transparent and verifiable
scientific communication. The modular copilot architecture also provides a
foundation for extending AI assistance to additional open science objectives
beyond reproducibility.

TL;DR: 利用多智能体LLM模拟研究流程，通过遗传编程优化架构发现，Genesys系统在多个基准测试中优于现有架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以利用大型语言模型（LLM）来发现新的语言模型架构，以模拟真实研究流程并提高发现效率。

Method: 提出Genesys系统，采用多智能体LLM方法，结合阶梯式规模扩展和遗传编程，从提案到验证全流程模拟研究。

Result: 实验生成1,162个新设计，其中1,062个通过预训练验证，最佳设计在6/9基准测试中优于GPT2和Mamba2等现有架构。

Conclusion: Genesys系统通过遗传编程和多智能体协作，有效实现了语言模型架构的自动化发现，并展示了其竞争力。

Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试（如MMLU）无法充分评估企业特定任务的复杂性，因此需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出了基于布鲁姆分类法的14任务框架，并开发了结合LLM-as-a-Labeler、LLM-as-a-Judge和CRAG的可扩展标注流程，构建了9700个样本的基准测试。

Result: 评估了六个领先模型，发现开源模型（如DeepSeek R1）在推理任务上接近专有模型，但在判断任务上表现较差，可能是由于过度思考。

Conclusion: 该研究为企业提供了定制化评估的蓝图，并推动了实用大语言模型的部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) ) have demonstrated promise in boosting
productivity across AI-powered tools, yet existing benchmarks like Massive
Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) inadequately assess enterprise-specific
task complexities. We propose a 14-task framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy
to holistically evaluate LLM capabilities in enterprise contexts. To address
challenges of noisy data and costly annotation, we develop a scalable pipeline
combining LLM-as-a-Labeler, LLM-as-a-Judge, and corrective retrieval-augmented
generation (CRAG), curating a robust 9,700-sample benchmark. Evaluation of six
leading models shows open-source contenders like DeepSeek R1 rival proprietary
models in reasoning tasks but lag in judgment-based scenarios, likely due to
overthinking. Our benchmark reveals critical enterprise performance gaps and
offers actionable insights for model optimization. This work provides
enterprises a blueprint for tailored evaluations and advances practical LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: Mobile-R1通过任务级奖励的交互学习有效增强代理能力，相关资源已开源以推动领域发展。

Abstract: Vision-language model-based mobile agents have gained the ability to not only
understand complex instructions and mobile screenshots, but also optimize their
action outputs via thinking and reasoning, benefiting from reinforcement
learning, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, existing
research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online
optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic
interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into
local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action
correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called
Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with
task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three
stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level
reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn
trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error
correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance
improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese
applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new
benchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including
the dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的特征生成方法因固有偏差和缺乏结构化推理指导，常产生过于简单或重复的特征。

Method: 通过多类型推理和自适应策略选择，引导LLM生成多样且信息丰富的特征。

Result: 在59个基准数据集上验证，REFeat平均预测准确率更高，且生成的特征更丰富有意义。

Conclusion: 结合丰富推理范式和自适应策略选择，LLM驱动的特征发现具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Feature engineering for tabular data remains a critical yet challenging step
in machine learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
automatically generate new features by leveraging their vast knowledge.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often produce overly simple or
repetitive features, partly due to inherent biases in the transformations the
LLM chooses and the lack of structured reasoning guidance during generation. In
this paper, we propose a novel method REFeat, which guides an LLM to discover
diverse and informative features by leveraging multiple types of reasoning to
steer the feature generation process. Experiments on 59 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach not only achieves higher predictive accuracy on
average, but also discovers more diverse and meaningful features. These results
highlight the promise of incorporating rich reasoning paradigms and adaptive
strategy selection into LLM-driven feature discovery for tabular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车在共享出行和配送服务中的普及，其续航限制和充电管理成为关键挑战。V2G技术的出现为电动汽车提供了向电网放电的能力，但也带来了新的运营复杂性。

Method: 作者将问题建模为混合整数规划（MIP），并提出两种近似最优的元启发式算法：进化算法（EA）和大邻域搜索算法（LNS）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据上可使司机利润翻倍，在小规模实例中接近最优解，且在大规模实例中具有优秀的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于电动汽车的智能出行系统提供了更高效、更盈利的解决方案，同时支持电网的能源管理。

Abstract: With the rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), modern service
systems, such as ride-hailing delivery services, are increasingly integrating
EVs into their operations. Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a
shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when
fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology -
allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and
complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem
with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select
customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or
discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging
station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed
Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic
algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood
search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver
profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on
small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a
promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that
actively support the energy grid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 业务流程管理系统需要优化任务分配、执行时机和人员指派等关键决策，现有工具在部分流程可观察性和多决策建模方面存在不足。

Method: 开发了GymPN软件库，基于深度强化学习，支持部分流程可观察性和多决策建模，扩展了现有方法的局限性。

Result: 在八种典型业务流程决策问题模式上评估，GymPN能轻松建模问题并学习最优决策策略。

Conclusion: GymPN通过引入部分可观察性和多决策建模能力，使业务流程决策更贴近现实，优化效果显著。

Abstract: Process management systems support key decisions about the way work is
allocated in organizations. This includes decisions on which task to perform
next, when to execute the task, and who to assign the task to. Suitable
software tools are required to support these decisions in a way that is optimal
for the organization. This paper presents a software library, called GymPN,
that supports optimal decision-making in business processes using Deep
Reinforcement Learning. GymPN builds on previous work that supports task
assignment in business processes, introducing two key novelties: support for
partial process observability and the ability to model multiple decisions in a
business process. These novel elements address fundamental limitations of
previous work and thus enable the representation of more realistic process
decisions. We evaluate the library on eight typical business process
decision-making problem patterns, showing that GymPN allows for easy modeling
of the desired problems, as well as learning optimal decision policies.

Motivation: 传统的神经细胞自动机（NCA）因其确定性而难以捕捉真实生物和物理系统中的随机性，限制了其在生命科学中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出混合神经细胞自动机（MNCA），将混合模型的概念引入NCA范式，结合概率规则分配和内在噪声，以模拟多样的局部行为和生物过程的随机动态。

Result: 在组织生长与分化的合成模拟、图像形态生成的鲁棒性以及显微镜图像分割三个领域中，MNCA表现出对扰动的更强鲁棒性、更真实的生物生长模式再现以及可解释的规则分割能力。

Conclusion: MNCA作为一种新型工具，在模拟随机动态系统和研究自生长过程中展现出巨大潜力，尤其在生命科学领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are a promising new approach to model
self-organizing processes, with potential applications in life science.
However, their deterministic nature limits their ability to capture the
stochasticity of real-world biological and physical systems.
  We propose the Mixture of Neural Cellular Automata (MNCA), a novel framework
incorporating the idea of mixture models into the NCA paradigm. By combining
probabilistic rule assignments with intrinsic noise, MNCAs can model diverse
local behaviors and reproduce the stochastic dynamics observed in biological
processes.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of MNCAs in three key domains: (1) synthetic
simulations of tissue growth and differentiation, (2) image morphogenesis
robustness, and (3) microscopy image segmentation. Results show that MNCAs
achieve superior robustness to perturbations, better recapitulate real
biological growth patterns, and provide interpretable rule segmentation. These
findings position MNCAs as a promising tool for modeling stochastic dynamical
systems and studying self-growth processes.

Result: 论文提出了一个具体的感知定义，并展示了如何在现有技术条件下实现这一功能性的感知能力。

Conclusion: 理解功能性感知的实现条件有助于在AI开发中有意识地控制感知能力的创建，并及时识别其存在。

Abstract: We spell out a definition of sentience that may be useful for designing and
building it in machines. We propose that for sentience to be meaningful for AI,
it must be fleshed out in functional, computational terms, in enough detail to
allow for implementation. Yet, this notion of sentience must also reflect
something essentially 'subjective', beyond just having the general capacity to
encode perceptual content. For this specific functional notion of sentience to
occur, we propose that certain sensory signals need to be both assertoric
(persistent) and qualitative. To illustrate the definition in more concrete
terms, we sketch out some ways for potential implementation, given current
technology. Understanding what it takes for artificial agents to be
functionally sentient can also help us avoid creating them inadvertently, or at
least, realize that we have created them in a timely manner.

Abstract: Driving in safety-critical scenarios requires quick, context-aware
decision-making grounded in both situational understanding and experiential
reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose
reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making.
However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to
challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of
experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in
dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a
Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for
evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach
integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the
retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver
recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments
across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision
accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior.
Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk
types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random
sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the
framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its
potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent
driving systems.

Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need
for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific
scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent
Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein
production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based
LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific
literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain,
and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to
extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel
methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent
optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the
performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based
cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine
similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean
scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved
the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to
prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with
the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling
the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of
additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

Abstract: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is
transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended.
PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific
computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three
decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists,
GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this
knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To
activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has
begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom
LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking
algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose
updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences
designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using
RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for
various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the
Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses
can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial
focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible
framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable
support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and
development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into
a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate
scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large language model-based machine learning (ML) agents have shown great
promise in automating ML research. However, existing agents typically operate
in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader

Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at

### [56] [The Decrypto Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reasoning and Theory of Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20664)
*Andrei Lupu,Timon Willi,Jakob Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Decrypto的基于游戏的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在多智能体推理和心理理论（ToM）方面的能力，发现当前最先进的推理模型在这些任务上表现不如旧模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）获得代理能力，它们需要在复杂的多智能体场景中导航，与人类用户和其他智能体在合作和竞争环境中互动。这需要新的推理能力，尤其是心理理论（ToM），即推理其他智能体的“心理”状态的能力。然而，目前对LLMs的ToM和其他多智能体能力的理解不足，因为现有基准测试存在范围狭窄、数据泄露、饱和和缺乏交互性等问题。

Method: 论文提出了Decrypto，一个基于游戏的基准测试，灵感来自认知科学、计算语用学和多智能体强化学习。它旨在在其他维度上尽可能简单，消除其他基准测试中常见的混杂因素。此外，论文还通过全面的实证评估、鲁棒性研究和人机交叉实验验证了基准设计。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs的游戏能力落后于人类和简单的词嵌入基线。此外，通过创建两个经典认知科学实验的变体来评估三个关键的ToM能力，发现最先进的推理模型在这些任务上表现显著不如旧模型。

Conclusion: Decrypto填补了当前推理和ToM评估中的关键空白，为开发更好的人工智能代理铺平了道路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to
navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other
agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning
skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason
about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent
abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from
narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus
propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM
drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and
multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in
all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other
benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing
interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations
of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We
find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple
word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive
science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.
Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly
worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that
Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and
paves the path towards better artificial agents.

### [57] [A Spatio-Temporal Point Process for Fine-Grained Modeling of Reading Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19999)
*Francesco Ignazio Re,Andreas Opedal,Glib Manaiev,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于时空点过程的阅读行为概率模型，通过霍克斯过程捕捉注视点和扫视的动态特性，发现传统理论难以解释精细眼动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阅读行为模型依赖聚合的眼动追踪数据，并强加假设，忽略了阅读过程中的时空动态特性。

Method: 使用标记的时空点过程模型，其中扫视通过霍克斯过程建模，注视持续时间通过时间卷积的预测函数建模。

Result: 霍克斯过程模型比基线更好地拟合人类扫视行为，但上下文惊奇值对注视持续时间的预测改进有限。

Conclusion: 惊奇理论难以解释精细眼动，提出的模型能更全面地捕捉阅读行为的时空动态。

Abstract: Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between
fixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades
where a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of
psycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields
insight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to
such modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that
impose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that
occur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic
model of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,
that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in
space and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes
process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new
fixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation
events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved
across time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process
model exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to
fixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a
predictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive
accuracy. This finding suggests that surprisal theory struggles to explain
fine-grained eye movements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习研究快速发展导致大量论文发表，但同行评审的局限性可能导致错误或有缺陷的研究被接受甚至突出展示。目前缺乏系统性的机制来纠正这些错误。

Method: 提出在机器学习会议中设立专门的R&C轨道，讨论轨道设计、评审原则和潜在问题，并提供一个示例提交。

Result: 通过建立R&C轨道，可以为批判性研究提供高声誉平台，从而推动研究生态系统的自我修正。

Conclusion: 机器学习会议应建立官方且声誉良好的机制，以帮助研究领域自我修正。

Abstract: Science progresses by iteratively advancing and correcting humanity's
understanding of the world. In machine learning (ML) research, rapid
advancements have led to an explosion of publications, but have also led to
misleading, incorrect, flawed or perhaps even fraudulent studies being accepted
and sometimes highlighted at ML conferences due to the fallibility of peer
review. While such mistakes are understandable, ML conferences do not offer
robust processes to help the field systematically correct when such errors are
made.This position paper argues that ML conferences should establish a
dedicated "Refutations and Critiques" (R & C) Track. This R & C Track would
provide a high-profile, reputable platform to support vital research that
critically challenges prior research, thereby fostering a dynamic
self-correcting research ecosystem. We discuss key considerations including
track design, review principles, potential pitfalls, and provide an
illustrative example submission concerning a recent ICLR 2025 Oral. We conclude
that ML conferences should create official, reputable mechanisms to help ML
research self-correct.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STIMULUS的新型多目标优化算法，通过递归框架和动量项提升收敛性能，并实现了较低的样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标优化（MOO）在机器学习和工程领域应用广泛，但现有方法在收敛速度和样本复杂度上表现不佳，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 提出STIMULUS算法，采用递归框架更新随机梯度估计；进一步引入动量项（STIMULUS-M）和自适应批处理（STIMULUS+/STIMULUS-M+）以优化性能。

Result: 在非凸和强凸设置下分别实现了O(1/T)和O(exp{-μT})的收敛速率，并达到了当前最优的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: STIMULUS及其变体在多目标优化中表现出色，显著提升了收敛速度和样本效率，适用于广泛的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recently, multi-objective optimization (MOO) has gained attention for its
broad applications in ML, operations research, and engineering. However, MOO
algorithm design remains in its infancy and many existing MOO methods suffer
from unsatisfactory convergence rate and sample complexity performance. To
address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm called STIMULUS(
stochastic path-integrated multi-gradient recursive e\ulstimator), a new and
robust approach for solving MOO problems. Different from the traditional
methods, STIMULUS introduces a simple yet powerful recursive framework for
updating stochastic gradient estimates to improve convergence performance with
low sample complexity. In addition, we introduce an enhanced version of
STIMULUS, termed STIMULUS-M, which incorporates a momentum term to further
expedite convergence. We establish $O(1/T)$ convergence rates of the proposed
methods for non-convex settings and $O (\exp{-\mu T})$ for strongly convex
settings, where $T$ is the total number of iteration rounds. Additionally, we
achieve the state-of-the-art $O \left(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-1}\right)$ sample
complexities for non-convex settings and $O\left(n+ \sqrt{n} \ln
({\mu/\epsilon})\right)$ for strongly convex settings, where $\epsilon>0$ is a
desired stationarity error. Moreover, to alleviate the periodic full gradient
evaluation requirement in STIMULUS and STIMULUS-M, we further propose enhanced
versions with adaptive batching called STIMULUS+/ STIMULUS-M+ and provide their
theoretical analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程的FlightKooba框架，用于高效解决飞行轨迹预测任务中的非线性系统建模问题，显著减少了训练时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前应用Koopman理论于飞行轨迹预测任务的模型效果不佳，模型可解释性差且计算量大，导致训练时间长。

Method: 结合HIPPO方法、Koopman理论和状态空间方程，直接通过数据构建Koopman算子，提高可解释性并减少可训练参数数量。

Result: FlightKooba在时间和内存消耗上表现优越，训练时间与未使用CUDA加速的Mamba模块相当，内存减少50%以上，参数数量减少十倍。

Conclusion: FlightKooba为Koopman算子的快速计算提供了新方法，为时间序列预测与控制的结合开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: The Koopman theory is a powerful and effective modeling tool for converting
nonlinear systems into linear representations, and flight trajectory prediction
(FTP) is a complex nonlinear system. However, current models applying the
Koopman theory to FTP tasks are not very effective, model interpretability is
indeed an issue, and the Koopman operators are computationally intensive,
resulting in long training times. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
new modeling and control framework based on the HIPPO method, the Koopman
theory, and state space equations from cybernetics: FlightKooba. Inspired by
the idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs
the Koopman operators from data. This makes the framework highly interpretable
and significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the module,
thereby greatly reducing training time. Experiments have demonstrated the
superiority of the FlightKooba modeling method in terms of time and memory
consumption (training time comparable to the Mamba module without using
CUDA-level acceleration; memory reduced by more than 50% on most datasets, with
a tenfold reduction in the number of parameters), essentially completing the
FTP task. It provides a new method for the fast computation of the Koopman
operators, opening up new possibilities for the combination of time series
forecasting and control.

### [61] [Causal-Aware Intelligent QoE Optimization for VR Interaction with Adaptive Keyframe Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19890)
*Ziru Zhang,Jiadong Yu,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自适应关键帧提取和因果感知强化学习的智能框架，以优化多用户VR交互中的体验质量(QoE)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多用户VR交互QoE优化方法往往忽略了带宽分配、CPU频率和用户感知之间的因果关系，限制了QoE的提升。

Method: 提出了一种基于Weber-Fechner定律的新QoE度量方法，并将QoE优化问题建模为混合整数规划任务。采用结合因果推理的PS-CDDPG算法进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著降低了交互延迟，提高了QoE，并保持了公平性，性能优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 通过因果感知强化学习和自适应关键帧提取的结合，该框架有效提升了多用户VR交互的体验质量。

Abstract: The optimization of quality of experience (QoE) in multi-user virtual reality
(VR) interactions demands a delicate balance between ultra-low latency,
high-fidelity motion synchronization, and equitable resource allocation. While
adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing
approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth,
CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an
intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe
extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE
metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual
sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.
The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming
(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational
resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By
leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by
various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal
inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments
conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework
significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains
fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于正交卷积核正则化的类感知软剪枝框架，实现快速精确的机器遗忘，显著降低计算开销并保持预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘方法在遗忘速度和预测精度之间存在权衡，通常需要高计算开销或导致保留类别的性能显著下降。为满足GDPR等隐私法规要求，需要一种高效且精确的遗忘方法。

Method: 通过正交卷积核正则化训练，解耦卷积滤波器和特征表示，并利用激活差异分析高效识别类特定通道，实现快速软剪枝。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet上的实验表明，该方法能以毫秒级响应时间实现目标类别的完全遗忘，同时保留数据的精度损失最小，并显著降低成员推理攻击风险。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLaaS场景中的实时机器遗忘提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，相比现有基线方法显著提升了遗忘速度。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove class-specific knowledge from
pretrained neural networks to satisfy privacy regulations such as the GDPR.
Existing methods typically face a trade-off between unlearning speed and
preservation of predictive accuracy, often incurring either high computational
overhead or significant performance degradation on retained classes. In this
paper, we propose a novel class-aware soft pruning framework leveraging
orthogonal convolutional kernel regularization to achieve rapid and precise
forgetting with millisecond-level response times. By enforcing orthogonality
constraints during training, our method decorrelates convolutional filters and
disentangles feature representations, while efficiently identifying
class-specific channels through activation difference analysis. Extensive
evaluations across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate stable
pruning with near-instant execution, complete forgetting of targeted classes,
and minimal accuracy loss on retained data. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and TinyImageNet confirm that our approach substantially reduces membership
inference attack risks and accelerates unlearning by orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides an efficient,
practical solution for real-time machine unlearning in Machine Learning as a
Service (MLaaS) scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce MIRAGE, a new benchmark for multimodal expert-level reasoning
and decision-making in consultative interaction settings. Designed for the
agriculture domain, MIRAGE captures the full complexity of expert consultations
by combining natural user queries, expert-authored responses, and image-based
context, offering a high-fidelity benchmark for evaluating models on grounded
reasoning, clarification strategies, and long-form generation in a real-world,
knowledge-intensive domain. Grounded in over 35,000 real user-expert
interactions and curated through a carefully designed multi-step pipeline,
MIRAGE spans diverse crop health, pest diagnosis, and crop management
scenarios. The benchmark includes more than 7,000 unique biological entities,
covering plant species, pests, and diseases, making it one of the most
taxonomically diverse benchmarks available for vision-language models, grounded
in the real world. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on well-specified user

*Jingzhi Hu,Geoffrey Ye Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DeKA-g算法，通过知识蒸馏和自适应传输优化生成式语义通信系统，显著提升边缘与云端生成内容的一致性及传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容（AIGC）的激增，从云端向边缘和移动用户传输这些内容会导致网络流量大幅增加。生成式语义通信（GSC）通过传输高度压缩的信息（如提示文本和潜在表示）而非高维AIGC数据，提供了解决方案。然而，GSC依赖于云端生成AI与边缘及用户知识之间的对齐，以及无线传输知识与实际信道条件之间的对齐，这仍具挑战性。

Method: 论文提出DeKA-g算法，包含两个核心方法：元词辅助知识蒸馏（MAKD）和可变速率分组信噪比自适应（VGSA）。MAKD通过优化元词提升知识蒸馏效率，VGSA则实现对不同压缩率和信噪比范围的高效自适应。

Result: 实验结果显示，DeKA-g将边缘生成图像与云端生成图像的对齐度提升了44%，在压缩率自适应效率上比基线高116%，并在低信噪比条件下性能提升28%。

Conclusion: DeKA-g通过知识蒸馏和自适应传输机制，有效解决了生成式语义通信中的知识对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to
edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.
Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by
transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent
representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on
the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that
possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless
transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this
paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm
for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the
cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and
used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel
conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge
distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,
an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge
distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression
rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment
between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.
Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the
baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.

Method: 采用深度神经网络预测价格，结合SHAP、Gradient等可解释方法和热力图分析五个电力市场的特征贡献。

Result: 通过SSHAP值和SSHAP线新概念，增强了高维表格模型的复杂表示能力。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络与可解释AI结合能有效揭示电力市场价格动态，提升市场机制理解。

Abstract: Electricity markets are highly complex, involving lots of interactions and
complex dependencies that make it hard to understand the inner workings of the
market and what is driving prices. Econometric methods have been developed for
this, white-box models, however, they are not as powerful as deep neural
network models (DNN). In this paper, we use a DNN to forecast the price and
then use XAI methods to understand the factors driving the price dynamics in
the market. The objective is to increase our understanding of how different
electricity markets work. To do that, we apply explainable methods such as SHAP
and Gradient, combined with visual techniques like heatmaps (saliency maps) to
analyse the behaviour and contributions of various features across five
electricity markets. We introduce the novel concepts of SSHAP values and SSHAP
lines to enhance the complex representation of high-dimensional tabular models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在高风险领域（如医疗诊断和自动驾驶）中的错误决策可能导致严重后果，因此需要有效的不确定性测量方法来检测和缓解这些错误。

Method: 提出一种后处理框架，通过检索与查询在各层具有相似激活向量的训练案例，计算两个新指标：决策变化和层不确定性，以捕捉跨层最近邻类分布的变化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上的分类模型评估表明，所提指标显著提升了不确定性估计效果，尤其在具有挑战性的分类任务中优于基于softmax的置信度方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过检索训练案例和计算新指标，有效增强了神经网络决策的不确定性估计能力，为高风险应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Networks have high accuracy in solving problems where it is difficult
to detect patterns or create a logical model. However, these algorithms
sometimes return wrong solutions, which become problematic in high-risk domains
like medical diagnosis or autonomous driving. One strategy to detect and
mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network
decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring
the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a
similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved
cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which
capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers. We
evaluated our approach in a classification model for two datasets: CIFAR-10 and
MNIST. The results show that these metrics enhance uncertainty estimation,
especially in challenging classification tasks, outperforming softmax-based
confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轴承故障可能导致严重的运行中断和维护成本。传统方法依赖大量标记数据且适应性不足，因此研究探索强化学习以提高诊断的准确性和适应性。

Method: 研究采用深度Q网络（DQN）这一强化学习方法，用于轴承故障分类任务，并优化奖励结构以提升性能。

Result: 在受控条件下，强化学习模型与传统监督学习模型性能相当，但在适应性上表现更优，尤其是在优化奖励结构后。然而，其计算需求较高。

Conclusion: 强化学习有潜力补充传统方法，为自适应诊断框架的发展铺平道路，但需进一步优化计算效率。

Abstract: Bearing faults in rotating machinery can lead to significant operational
disruptions and maintenance costs. Modern methods for bearing fault diagnosis
rely heavily on vibration analysis and machine learning techniques, which often
require extensive labeled data and may not adapt well to dynamic environments.
This study explores the feasibility of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), for bearing fault classification tasks in
machine condition monitoring to enhance the accuracy and adaptability of
bearing fault diagnosis. The results demonstrate that while RL models developed
in this study can match the performance of traditional supervised learning
models under controlled conditions, they excel in adaptability when equipped
with optimized reward structures. However, their computational demands
highlight areas for further improvement. These findings demonstrate RL's
potential to complement traditional methods, paving the way for adaptive
diagnostic frameworks.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将掩码扩散模型（MDM）置于仅解码器框架中，公平比较了自回归（AR）与MDM范式，并探讨了架构对MDM的影响，发现仅解码器MDM在生成速度上有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要采用自回归方法，而掩码扩散模型作为新兴替代方案，其与自回归模型的比较常因架构差异而难以公平。本研究旨在消除架构差异的干扰，直接比较两种范式的核心差异。

Method: 研究将掩码扩散模型应用于仅解码器架构，将其视为任意顺序自回归（AO-AR）模型，并与标准自回归模型进行比较。同时，探讨了仅编码器与仅解码器架构在MDM中的表现差异。

Result: 研究发现，标准AO-AR目标可能因平均所有标记排列而降低效率，而仅解码器MDM尽管建模空间更大，却能实现约25倍的生成速度提升，并在困惑度上与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: 该工作成功分离了范式差异与架构影响，为未来模型设计提供了重要见解，表明仅解码器MDM在速度与性能间具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)
approaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable
alternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their
typical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs
have largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling
paradigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as
it's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm
itself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a
decoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or
AO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard
AO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from
refinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the
language's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural
influences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that
while encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,
decoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\sim25\times$) and
comparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly
larger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core
paradigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for
future model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.

Motivation: 当前可解释机器学习中，特征组联合信号常被忽视，而实际中最重要的预测因子往往是特征组的联合效应，尤其是在多模态数据集中。

Method: 提出了一种高效的方法，用于确定GAMs中特征组的重要性，支持事后定义组、重叠组，且无需模型重新训练。

Result: 通过合成实验和医学案例（抑郁症症状识别和髋关节置换术后健康社会决定因素）验证了方法的有效性，显示特征组分析比单特征分析更全面准确。

Conclusion: 分析特征组重要性提供了更准确、全面的视角，尤其在医学领域，有助于揭示单特征分析可能忽略的关键洞察。

Abstract: While analyzing the importance of features has become ubiquitous in
interpretable machine learning, the joint signal from a group of related
features is sometimes overlooked or inadvertently excluded. Neglecting the
joint signal could bypass a critical insight: in many instances, the most
significant predictors are not isolated features, but rather the combined
effect of groups of features. This can be especially problematic for datasets
that contain natural groupings of features, including multimodal datasets. This
paper introduces a novel approach to determine the importance of a group of
features for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that is efficient, requires no
model retraining, allows defining groups posthoc, permits overlapping groups,
and remains meaningful in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, this definition
offers a parallel with explained variation in statistics. We showcase
properties of our method on three synthetic experiments that illustrate the
behavior of group importance across various data regimes. We then demonstrate
the importance of groups of features in identifying depressive symptoms from a
multimodal neuroscience dataset, and study the importance of social
determinants of health after total hip arthroplasty. These two case studies
reveal that analyzing group importance offers a more accurate, holistic view of
the medical issues compared to a single-feature analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HERCULES是一种新型算法和Python包，用于对多种数据类型进行分层k-means聚类，并通过集成大型语言模型（LLMs）生成语义丰富的聚类标题和描述，提升结果的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂数据集的爆炸性增长，需要先进的工具不仅能有效分组数据，还能提供人类可理解的聚类结构洞察。

Method: HERCULES通过递归应用k-means聚类构建层次结构，支持两种表示模式：基于原始数据嵌入的`direct`模式和基于LLM生成摘要嵌入的`description`模式，并利用LLM生成聚类描述。

Result: HERCULES展示了从复杂数据集中提取有意义、分层知识的能力，并通过交互式可视化工具帮助用户理解和分析聚类结果。

Conclusion: HERCULES为处理多模态数据提供了一种高效且可解释的聚类方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The explosive growth of complex datasets across various modalities
necessitates advanced analytical tools that not only group data effectively but
also provide human-understandable insights into the discovered structures. We
introduce HERCULES (Hierarchical Embedding-based Recursive Clustering Using
LLMs for Efficient Summarization), a novel algorithm and Python package
designed for hierarchical k-means clustering of diverse data types, including
text, images, and numeric data (processed one modality per run). HERCULES
constructs a cluster hierarchy by recursively applying k-means clustering,
starting from individual data points at level 0. A key innovation is its deep
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically rich
titles and descriptions for clusters at each level of the hierarchy,
significantly enhancing interpretability. The algorithm supports two main
representation modes: `direct' mode, which clusters based on original data
embeddings or scaled numeric features, and `description' mode, which clusters
based on embeddings derived from LLM-generated summaries. Users can provide a
`topic\_seed' to guide LLM-generated summaries towards specific themes. An
interactive visualization tool facilitates thorough analysis and understanding
of the clustering results. We demonstrate HERCULES's capabilities and discuss
its potential for extracting meaningful, hierarchical knowledge from complex
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TRACED方法，通过结合转移预测误差和共学习性指标改进UED框架，提升强化学习智能体在未知环境中的零样本泛化能力，同时减少环境交互需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督环境设计(UED)方法主要通过价值函数损失近似衡量学习潜力（即遗憾值），难以全面反映任务间的相互影响。需要更精确的遗憾近似和任务关系建模来提升课程设计的样本效率。

Method: 提出TRACED框架：1) 在遗憾近似中引入转移预测误差项；2) 设计轻量级共学习性指标量化任务间影响；3) 结合两者动态生成课程。

Result: 实验表明：1) TRACED在多个基准测试中提升零样本泛化性能；2) 比基线方法减少50%环境交互；3) 转移预测误差驱动任务复杂度快速提升，共学习性指标带来额外增益。

Conclusion: 通过改进遗憾近似和显式建模任务关系，TRACED实现了更高效的课程设计，为UED框架提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments
remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher
adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns
a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically
measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current
performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these
approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term
in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects
performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called
co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware
Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).
Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot
generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer
environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that
co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition
prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation
and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for
sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于谐振放电（RF）神经元的无线分割计算架构，用于高效处理具有丰富频谱特征的实时时间序列信号，显著降低了计算和传输能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统泄漏积分放电（LIF）脉冲神经元无法有效捕捉边缘应用（如无线传感和音频识别）中具有丰富频谱特征的流信号，因此需要一种更高效的神经形态计算方法。

Method: 采用谐振放电（RF）神经元，利用其振荡动力学直接处理时域信号，无需昂贵的频谱预处理，并通过可调谐频率提取时间局部化频谱特征。

Result: 实验结果表明，RF-SNN架构在音频分类和调制分类任务中达到了与LIF-SNN和ANN相当的精度，同时显著降低了脉冲率和推理与通信的总能耗。

Conclusion: RF-SNN架构在保持高精度的同时，显著提升了能效，适用于边缘计算中的实时时间序列处理。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional
deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many
edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate
streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured
by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper
investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs
resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain
signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By
resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral
features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity
translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission
energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike
transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance
on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental
results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy
to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and
total energy consumption during inference and communication.

Motivation: 客户异构性导致传统量子联邦学习性能受限，尤其在医疗和基因组等关键领域亟需提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用深度展开框架使客户端自主优化学习率等超参数，结合实时训练实现动态适应。

Result: 在基因表达分析和癌症检测中达到90%准确率（传统方法仅55%），量子模拟器与硬件实验均验证有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可学习的优化步骤突破传统QFL局限，为医疗等复杂场景提供通用量子学习解决方案。

Abstract: Client heterogeneity poses significant challenges to the performance of
Quantum Federated Learning (QFL). To overcome these limitations, we propose a
new approach leveraging deep unfolding, which enables clients to autonomously
optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rates and regularization factors,
based on their specific training behavior. This dynamic adaptation mitigates
overfitting and ensures robust optimization in highly heterogeneous
environments where standard aggregation methods often fail. Our framework
achieves approximately 90% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional
methods, which typically yield around 55% accuracy, as demonstrated through
real-time training on IBM quantum hardware and Qiskit Aer simulators. By
developing self adaptive fine tuning, the proposed method proves particularly
effective in critical applications such as gene expression analysis and cancer
detection, enhancing diagnostic precision and predictive modeling within
quantum systems. Our results are attributed to convergence-aware, learnable
optimization steps intrinsic to the deep unfolded framework, which maintains
the generalization. Hence, this study addresses the core limitations of
conventional QFL, streamlining its applicability to any complex challenges such
as healthcare and genomic research.

Motivation: 传统时间序列插补模型使用完整数据集和人工掩码模式模拟缺失值，而实际基础设施监测中数据缺失模式复杂且异质，现有方法难以应对。

Method: 提出DIM-SUM框架，结合模式聚类和自适应掩码策略，并附带理论学习保证，以处理实际数据中的多样化缺失模式。

Result: 在加州水务、电力数据集和基准测试中，DIM-SUM以更少训练数据和更低处理时间达到与传统方法相近的准确度，相比大型预训练模型准确度提升2倍且推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: DIM-SUM有效弥合了人工掩码训练数据与真实缺失模式间的差距，为实际应用提供了高效鲁棒的插补解决方案。

Abstract: Time series imputation models have traditionally been developed using
complete datasets with artificial masking patterns to simulate missing values.
However, in real-world infrastructure monitoring, practitioners often encounter
datasets where large amounts of data are missing and follow complex,
heterogeneous patterns. We introduce DIM-SUM, a preprocessing framework for
training robust imputation models that bridges the gap between artificially
masked training data and real missing patterns. DIM-SUM combines pattern
clustering and adaptive masking strategies with theoretical learning guarantees
to handle diverse missing patterns actually observed in the data. Through
extensive experiments on over 2 billion readings from California water
districts, electricity datasets, and benchmarks, we demonstrate that DIM-SUM
outperforms traditional methods by reaching similar accuracy with lower
processing time and significantly less training data. When compared against a
large pre-trained model, DIM-SUM averages 2x higher accuracy with significantly
less inference time.

*Salva Rühling Cachay,Miika Aittala,Karsten Kreis,Noah Brenowitz,Arash Vahdat,Morteza Mardani,Rose Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM)，一种将滚动预测结构与Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM)相结合的新框架，用于处理高维混沌系统中的概率预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在高维混沌系统中通常逐帧预测未来状态，难以建模复杂的时间依赖性，且未明确考虑系统固有的不确定性增长。滚动扩散框架虽被提出以解决此问题，但与高性能扩散技术的结合仍具挑战性。

Method: ERDM通过三个关键贡献整合了EDM的核心组件（噪声调度、网络预处理和Heun采样器）到滚动预测设置中：(i) 新颖的损失加权方案，聚焦于中等预测范围；(ii) 使用预训练EDM进行初始窗口的高效初始化策略；(iii) 定制混合序列架构，用于渐进去噪下的稳健时空特征提取。

Result: 在2D Navier-Stokes模拟和ERA5全球天气预报（1.5°分辨率）中，ERDM持续优于基于扩散的基线方法，包括条件自回归EDM。

Conclusion: ERDM提供了一个灵活且强大的通用框架，适用于解决基于扩散的序列生成问题，其中建模不断升级的不确定性至关重要。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most
applications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots
one-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal
dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of
uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which
apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to
address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion
techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by
introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to
successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant
design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM
components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the
rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three
key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model
capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to
stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained
EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture
for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D
Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\circ
resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,
including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful
general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems
where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在最后一层重训练（LLR）的中间参数化区域中，损失加权对平衡不同类别性能的有效性，并指出必须考虑模型的相对过参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在判别任务中的能力增强，其克服训练数据引入的偏差的能力受到越来越多的关注。之前的研究表明，在欠参数化和过参数化两种极端情况下，损失加权的效果截然不同。本研究旨在探索介于这两种极端之间的中间区域，即最后一层重训练（LLR）的情况。

Method: 本研究通过理论和实践相结合的方法，分析了在LLR区域中损失加权的有效性，并特别强调了考虑模型相对过参数化的重要性。

Result: 研究发现，在LLR区域中，损失加权仍然有效，但必须考虑模型的相对过参数化。这一结论在理论和实践中均得到了验证。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，在中间参数化区域的LLR中，损失加权是有效的，但必须根据模型的相对过参数化进行调整，以确保不同类别的性能均衡。

Abstract: While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at
scale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come
under increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes
of parameterization with very different behaviors: the population
(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable
overparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal
performance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer
retraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently
inseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two
aforementioned extremes. We show, in theory and practice, that loss weighting
is still effective in this regime, but that these weights \emph{must} take into
account the relative overparameterization of the model.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的理论框架和计算方法，用于生成多样化的行动方案池，以应对多智能体任务分配中的环境变化和能力差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在灾难响应、搜救和军事任务等多智能体操作中，需要自动化流程来规划行动方案（COA）。环境变化（如雨雪、障碍物等）和智能体能力差异对COA的预期性能产生影响，因此需要多样化的COA池。

Method: 论文采用图抽象方法对任务空间和COA池进行建模，使用遗传算法进行多机器人任务分配，以最大化COA池的多样性和任务兼容性。此外，通过图神经网络和策略梯度方法进行单智能体任务排序。

Result: 在模拟环境中的测试表明，该方法相比随机基线有显著性能提升，任务排序的最优性差距较小，且能在约50分钟内为5个智能体和100个任务规划多达20个COA。

Conclusion: 该研究为多智能体任务分配提供了一种高效且多样化的行动方案生成方法，能够适应环境变化和智能体能力差异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Operations in disaster response, search \& rescue, and military missions that
involve multiple agents demand automated processes to support the planning of
the courses of action (COA). Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the
environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance
of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task
distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which
could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities
and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new
theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse
pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.
Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the
pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a
centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used
for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize
diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task
mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to
then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes
completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation
process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain
over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and
execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task
operations.

Conclusion: 该验证框架为边缘设备上的机器学习模型提供了可验证、隐私保护且高效的数据遗忘方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Machine learning providers commonly distribute global models to edge devices,
which subsequently personalize these models using local data. However, issues
such as copyright infringements, biases, or regulatory requirements may require
the verifiable removal of certain data samples across all edge devices.
Ensuring that edge devices correctly execute such unlearning operations is
critical to maintaining integrity.
  In this work, we introduce a verification framework leveraging zero-knowledge
proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs, to confirm data unlearning on personalized
edge-device models without compromising privacy. We have developed algorithms
explicitly designed to facilitate unlearning operations that are compatible
with efficient zk-SNARK proof generation, ensuring minimal computational and
memory overhead suitable for constrained edge environments. Furthermore, our
approach carefully preserves personalized enhancements on edge devices,
maintaining model performance post-unlearning.
  Our results affirm the practicality and effectiveness of this verification
framework, demonstrating verifiable unlearning with minimal degradation in
personalization-induced performance improvements. Our methodology ensures
verifiable, privacy-preserving, and effective machine unlearning across edge

Method: 采用向量量化技术，结合top-k温度采样和EMA码本更新，以及基于方向相似性的k-means++初始化方法，以压缩和解释跨层特征。

Result: CLVQVAE框架能够有效压缩重复特征为紧凑的概念向量，同时保持码本多样性，更好地对齐词嵌入空间的语义结构。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解Transformer模型中跨层特征演化提供了新方法，通过量化技术提升了特征的紧凑性和可解释性。

Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant
challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates
information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models.
Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single
layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy
it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for
activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited
set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose
\gls{clvqvae}, a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations
across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features
into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines
top-$k$ temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook
updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while
maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with
scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by
directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic
structure in word embedding space.

Abstract: The classification of imbalanced data streams, which have unequal class
distributions, is a key difficulty in machine learning, especially when dealing
with multiple classes. While binary imbalanced data stream classification tasks
have received considerable attention, only a few studies have focused on
multi-class imbalanced data streams. Effectively managing the dynamic imbalance
ratio is a key challenge in this domain. This study introduces a novel, robust,
and resilient approach to address these challenges by integrating Locality
Sensitive Hashing with Random Hyperplane Projections (LSH-RHP) into the Dynamic
Ensemble Diversification (DynED) framework. To the best of our knowledge, we
present the first application of LSH-RHP for undersampling in the context of
imbalanced non-stationary data streams. The proposed method undersamples the
majority classes by utilizing LSH-RHP, provides a balanced training set, and
improves the ensemble's prediction performance. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on 23 real-world and ten semi-synthetic datasets and compare
LSH-DynED with 15 state-of-the-art methods. The results reveal that LSH-DynED
outperforms other approaches in terms of both Kappa and mG-Mean effectiveness
measures, demonstrating its capability in dealing with multi-class imbalanced
non-stationary data streams. Notably, LSH-DynED performs well in large-scale,
high-dimensional datasets with considerable class imbalances and demonstrates
adaptation and robustness in real-world circumstances. To motivate our design,
we review existing methods for imbalanced data streams, outline key challenges,
and offer guidance for future work. For the reproducibility of our results, we
have made our implementation available on GitHub.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in the
healthcare domain. However, what remained challenging is quantifying the
predictive uncertainty of GNNs, which is an important aspect of trustworthiness
in clinical settings. While Bayesian and ensemble methods can be used to
quantify uncertainty, they are computationally expensive. Additionally, the
disagreement metric used by ensemble methods to compute uncertainty cannot
capture the diversity of models in an ensemble network. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, based on knowledge distillation, to quantify GNNs'
uncertainty more efficiently and with higher precision. We apply
self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and
student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks
independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an
uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning
different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the
precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing
out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The
evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture
the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to
that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: We investigate the use of randomly generated data for the sake of
pre-training a model. We justify this approach theoretically from the
perspective of algorithmic complexity, building on recent research that shows
that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. We
derive similar, but complementary theoretical results. We show empirically that
synthetically generated data can be used to pre-train a model before the data
is seen. We replicate earlier results that models trained this way show
zero-shot in-context learning across a variety of datasets, and that this
performance improves with scale. We extend earlier results to real-world data,
and show that finetuning a model after pre-training offers faster convergence
and better generalization.

Abstract: Developing effective instruction-following policies in reinforcement learning
remains challenging due to the reliance on extensive human-labeled instruction
datasets and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate open-ended instructions retrospectively
from previously collected agent trajectories. Our core idea is to employ LLMs
to relabel unsuccessful trajectories by identifying meaningful subtasks the
agent has implicitly accomplished, thereby enriching the agent's training data
and substantially alleviating reliance on human annotations. Through this
open-ended instruction relabeling, we efficiently learn a unified
instruction-following policy capable of handling diverse tasks within a single
policy. We empirically evaluate our proposed method in the challenging Craftax
environment, demonstrating clear improvements in sample efficiency, instruction
coverage, and overall policy performance compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness of utilizing LLM-guided
open-ended instruction relabeling to enhance instruction-following
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型监督耦合矩阵-张量分解方法（SCMTF），用于整合患者报告结果（PROs）和实验室数据，以预测溃疡性结肠炎患者的药物持续性。该方法首次在UC领域和PRO数据中应用，并成功处理了大量缺失数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者报告的症状（PROs）通常噪声大、主观性强且数据稀疏，因此在表型分析和其他机器学习方法中常被忽略。本研究旨在探索如何利用这些数据，通过计算表型分析来预测溃疡性结肠炎患者的药物持续性。

Method: 采用监督耦合矩阵-张量分解（SCMTF）方法，整合时间序列的PROs和实验室数据以及静态特征，使用深度学习框架使模型灵活且易于训练。

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上预测未来8个月和20个月药物变化的AUC分别为0.853和0.803。研究还提取了包含静态和时间特征的可解释表型，证明PROs中包含通常被忽略的相关信息。

Conclusion: 低秩矩阵和张量分解方法可成功应用于UC领域和高度缺失的PRO数据，提取的表型有助于预测药物持续性，表明PROs中包含有价值的信息。

Abstract: Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify
different types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix
and tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with
multi-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial
for understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially
in conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported
symptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than
other data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping
and other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of
computational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a
novel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which
integrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict
medication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based
method that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the
UC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework
that makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us
to handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts
changes in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and
0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes
consisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal
patterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be
successfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We
identify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes
include several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant
infromation that is usually discarded.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了预测性维护（PdM）中回归与分类方法的比较，强调其在工业应用中的重要性及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性维护在现代工业中至关重要，但目前缺乏对回归与分类方法的系统比较研究。

Method: 通过综合分析近期文献，比较回归和分类方法在预测设备故障和剩余使用寿命中的应用。

Result: 回归方法通常估计剩余使用寿命，分类方法预测故障概率，并指出数据不平衡和高维特征等挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为PdM方法的选择提供了指导，并建议未来关注公共数据集和开源工具以推动研究进展。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) has become a crucial element of modern
industrial practice. PdM plays a significant role in operational dependability
and cost management by decreasing unforeseen downtime and optimizing asset life
cycle management. Machine learning and deep learning have enabled more precise
forecasts of equipment failure and remaining useful life (RUL). Although many
studies have been conducted on PdM, there has not yet been a standalone
comparative study between regression- and classification-based approaches. In
this review, we look across a range of PdM methodologies, while focusing more
strongly on the comparative use of classification and regression methods in
prognostics. While regression-based methods typically provide estimates of RUL,
classification-based methods present a forecast of the probability of failure
across defined time intervals. Through a comprehensive analysis of recent
literature, we highlight key advancements, challenges-such as data imbalance
and high-dimensional feature spaces-and emerging trends, including hybrid
approaches and AI-enabled prognostic systems. This review aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with an awareness of the strengths and
compromises of various PdM methods and to help identify future research and
build more robust, directed adaptive maintenance systems. Future work may
include a systematic review of practical aspects such as public datasets,
benchmarking platforms, and open-source tools to support the advancement of PdM
research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为多级集成学习（MEL）的新框架，用于在边缘计算环境中实现弹性推理，通过训练多个轻量级备份模型来保证在故障情况下的高准确性和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算环境中的AI推理服务对低延迟有较高要求，但边缘环境资源有限且容易发生故障。传统的故障恢复方法如云故障转移或压缩备份往往在延迟或准确性上有所妥协，无法满足关键边缘推理服务的需求。

Method: 提出多级集成学习（MEL）框架，通过多目标优化问题训练多个轻量级备份模型，这些模型可以协作运行，在多个服务器可用时相互优化，在故障时独立运行并保持高准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，MEL在视觉、语言和音频数据集上表现接近原始架构，同时提供容错能力和部署灵活性。集成模型大小仅为原模型的40%，性能相似，故障情况下仍能保持95.6%的集成准确率。

Conclusion: MEL框架在边缘计算环境中有效实现了高准确性和低延迟的弹性推理，为边缘AI服务提供了一种可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency
services. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and
susceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as
cloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,
limiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this
paper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for
resilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup
models capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple
servers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good
accuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective
optimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages
diversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,
while ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical
evaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides
performance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault
tolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show
that our ensemble model, sized at 40\% of the original model, achieves similar
performance, while preserving 95.6\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of
failures when trained using MEL.

Motivation: 野火强度和频率急剧上升，而传统地面采集燃料湿度数据成本高、更新慢，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用预训练的多模态卫星数据模型，构建自动化管道生成全美高分辨率燃料湿度地图。

Result: 相比随机初始化模型，新方法将均方根误差降低20%，并在两处火灾区域验证有效性。

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate.
Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring
critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency.
Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is
valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However,
ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire,
resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of
a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating
large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves
significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized
models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables
rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate
its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and
Palisades).

*Bala Rajesh Konkathi,Arun K. Tangirala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为变量划分（PoV）的方法，用于在LTI-DAE系统中进行因果发现，优于现有方法，适用于纯动态系统和混合因果系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法在处理具有代数关系或混合因果的动态系统时存在局限性，需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 采用变量划分（PoV）方法，结合动态迭代PCA（DIPCA）确定代数关系数、动态关系数和约束矩阵，并通过条件数识别因果驱动变量。

Result: PoV方法能够有效识别因果驱动变量，适用于纯动态系统和混合因果系统，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PoV方法在LTI-DAE系统中表现出色，优于现有方法，为因果网络的数据驱动重建提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is
of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A
recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal
discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are
identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical
systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method
works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations.
However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are
coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or
mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables
(PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is
superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as
PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic
equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal
subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations
($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix.
Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of
the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络和反事实干预的偏微分方程(PDE)因果结构发现框架，通过算子级必要性量化和因果敏感性指标，在理论和实证上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如残差最小化或稀疏回归在PDE因果结构发现中存在局限性，论文旨在开发一种更原则性的框架，通过功能干预和因果分析提升结构发现的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 结合物理信息神经网络(PINNs)和反事实扰动，引入因果敏感性指数和结构偏差度量，通过变分残差分析评估候选微分算子的影响。

Result: 理论证明在受限等距或互相干条件下可精确恢复因果算子支持，实证表明该方法在噪声、冗余和数据稀缺情况下优于标准PINNs和DeepONets。

Conclusion: 该框架将PDE因果发现转化为可解释的结构因果模型推断任务，为气候、肿瘤扩散等领域的动力学建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: We develop a principled framework for discovering causal structure in partial
differential equations (PDEs) using physics-informed neural networks and
counterfactual perturbations. Unlike classical residual minimization or sparse
regression methods, our approach quantifies operator-level necessity through
functional interventions on the governing dynamics. We introduce causal
sensitivity indices and structural deviation metrics to assess the influence of
candidate differential operators within neural surrogates. Theoretically, we
prove exact recovery of the causal operator support under restricted isometry
or mutual coherence conditions, with residual bounds guaranteeing
identifiability. Empirically, we validate the framework on both synthetic and
real-world datasets across climate dynamics, tumor diffusion, and ocean flows.
Our method consistently recovers governing operators even under noise,
redundancy, and data scarcity, outperforming standard PINNs and DeepONets in
structural fidelity. This work positions causal PDE discovery as a tractable
and interpretable inference task grounded in structural causal models and
variational residual analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuoGPT提出了一种结合权重剪枝和激活稀疏性的双稀疏框架，显著提升大语言模型的部署效率，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）因高内存和计算成本难以部署，现有剪枝方法未充分利用运行时激活稀疏性。

Method: 将激活稀疏性重新解释为动态结构化权重稀疏性，结合非结构化权重剪枝构建双稀疏（spMspV）工作负载，并通过激活感知校准和密集模型输出残差优化精度。

Result: 在LLaMA-2和LLaMA-3上，DuoGPT在1.39倍加速下比现有结构化剪枝方法精度提升高达9.17%。

Conclusion: DuoGPT通过统一的双稀疏框架有效平衡了LLMs的部署效率与精度，为大规模模型优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but are difficult to
deploy due to high memory and compute costs. While pruning reduces these
demands, most methods ignore activation sparsity observed at runtime. We
reinterpret activation sparsity as dynamic structured weight sparsity and
propose DuoGPT, a unified framework that constructs dual-sparse (spMspV)
workloads by combining unstructured weight pruning with activation sparsity. To
preserve accuracy, we extend the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) framework with
activation-aware calibration and introduce output residuals from the dense
model as correction terms. We further optimize the solution for efficient GPU
execution, enabling scalability to billion-parameter LLMs. Evaluations on
LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 show that DuoGPT outperforms state-of-the-art structured
pruning methods by up to 9.17% accuracy at an iso-speedup of 1.39$\times$
compared to the baseline dense model.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的代码比例增加，需要一种可靠的方法来溯源代码的来源。

Method: 使用假设检验和密度估计，将代码溯源问题转化为分布测试问题。

Result: Anubis在区分DeepSeek-Coder、CodeGemma和Stable-Coder等模型时，仅需约2000个样本即可达到高AUROC分数（≥0.9）。

Conclusion: Anubis是一种有效的零样本代码溯源工具，能够高效准确地识别代码来源。

Abstract: A growing fraction of all code is sampled from Large Language Models (LLMs).
We investigate the problem of attributing code generated by language models
using hypothesis testing to leverage established techniques and guarantees.
Given a set of samples $S$ and a suspect model $\mathcal{L}^*$, our goal is to
assess the likelihood of $S$ originating from $\mathcal{L}^*$. Due to the curse
of dimensionality, this is intractable when only samples from the LLM are
given: to circumvent this, we use both samples and density estimates from the
LLM, a form of access commonly available.
  We introduce $\mathsf{Anubis}$, a zero-shot attribution tool that frames
attribution as a distribution testing problem. Our experiments on a benchmark
of code samples show that $\mathsf{Anubis}$ achieves high AUROC scores (
$\ge0.9$) when distinguishing between LLMs like DeepSeek-Coder, CodeGemma, and
Stable-Code using only $\approx 2000$ samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算中启动效应带来的数据模糊性问题尚未充分探索，尤其是在生理信号层面，这可能导致模型分类错误。

Result: 使用无启动序列训练的模型，其误分类率相比原始数据显著降低。

Conclusion: APS方法有效识别并缓解了数据层面的启动效应，增强了模型鲁棒性，为情感计算数据集的设计和采集提供了新思路。

Abstract: Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective
computing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a
label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by
the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in
physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead
to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the
Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points
influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,
quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this
method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient
transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train
models with the same configuration using both the original data and
priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced
when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work
contributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating
priming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering
valuable insights for the design and collection of affective computing
datasets.

Conclusion: 通过结合特征嵌入和社区信息，并利用有向线图转换，该方法显著提升了有向链接预测的性能。

Abstract: Link prediction is a classical problem in graph analysis with many practical
applications. For directed graphs, recently developed deep learning approaches
typically analyze node similarities through contrastive learning and aggregate
neighborhood information through graph convolutions. In this work, we propose a
novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with
community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features
can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such
features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs
into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate
more information during graph convolutions. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases when 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60% of the connected links are used as training data,
respectively.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）面临非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的挑战，现有解决方案要么专注于构建强大的全局模型，要么定制个性化局部模型，但难以同时实现两者。此外，许多解决方案依赖公共数据集，增加了数据泄露风险。

Method: 提出FedBKD框架，利用GAN生成合成数据，局部模型作为判别器且参数冻结。合成数据用于全局和局部模型之间的双向蒸馏，促进知识交互，提升双方性能。

Conclusion: FedBKD通过无数据蒸馏有效解决了FL中的non-IID问题，同时提升了全局和局部模型的性能，避免了数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative machine learning
(ML) technique. It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands
and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL
is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data.
Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or
customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a
well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time.
Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from
introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data
leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation
framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD).
Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic
data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their
parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional
distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions
so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive
experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show
that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.

Abstract: Quantized large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention and
significance for enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.
However, emerging studies on a few calibration dataset-free quantization
methods suggest that quantization may compromise the safety capabilities of
LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for systematic safety evaluations and
effective mitigation strategies. In this paper, we present comprehensive safety
evaluations across various mainstream quantization techniques and diverse
calibration datasets, utilizing widely accepted safety benchmarks. To address
the identified safety vulnerabilities, we propose a quantization-aware safety
patching framework, Q-resafe, to efficiently restore the safety capabilities of
quantized LLMs while minimizing any adverse impact on utility. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that Q-resafe successfully re-aligns the
safety of quantized LLMs with their pre-quantization counterparts, even under
challenging evaluation scenarios. Project page is available at:

Abstract: Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.

Motivation: 当同一预测任务存在多个性能相同但预测结果不同的模型时（模型多样性），传统集成方法难以保证反事实解释的跨模型有效性。需要一种能同时考虑预测结果和补救措施鲁棒性的集成方法。

Method: 提出'补救感知集成（RAE）'框架，设计六项理想性质，并开发基于计算论证的新方法：通过论证框架显式建模模型与反事实间的冲突，利用论证语义学（四种不同语义）解析冲突，支持自定义模型偏好。

Result: 理论分析论证了四种论证语义下的方法行为，实验验证了提出的八个方法实例均能有效满足理想性质，实现预测与补救的协同优化。

Conclusion: 通过计算论证将模型多样性与反事实鲁棒性统一处理，为可解释AI提供了可定制、理论完备的集成解决方案，其参数化特性支持不同应用场景的需求。

Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing
models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with
different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises
when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for
which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.
Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under
MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,
the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of
providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We
propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be
considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and
recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six
desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose
a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs
under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to
explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding
prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to
resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is
parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the
specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further
customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we
characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different
argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of
our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，通过从多个集群的知识中蒸馏出一个通用专家模型，以解决非独立同分布数据带来的挑战，并在保留细粒度特性的同时整合共享知识。


<details>

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法在各种场景下均表现出优越性能，能够更有效地平衡个性化和共享知识，从而推动聚类联邦学习的发展。

Conclusion: 通过蒸馏通用专家模型，本文提出的方法在处理模型异构性和减少集群间冲突方面表现出更大的灵活性，为联邦学习中的知识共享和个性化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) addresses the challenges posed by non-IID
data by training multiple group- or cluster-specific expert models. However,
existing methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which
represents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the
Federated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper
introduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the
knowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared
information across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client
as the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL
framework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each
client, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert
distillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of
fine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared
knowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation
methods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater
flexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among
cluster-specific experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method across various scenarios,
highlighting its potential to advance the state of CFL by balancing
personalized and shared knowledge more effectively.

TL;DR: 该论文首次提出基于学习的QR码解码方法，探索中等输入敏感性的学习函数，发现Transformer能突破理论纠错限制解码QR码，并展示了对不同语言的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索不同输入敏感性任务的学习难度，特别是中等敏感性的QR码解码任务，以填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 采用Transformer模型学习QR码结构，通过训练数据（主要是英文文本）学习解码机制，并测试其在其他语言和随机字符串上的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，Transformer能成功解码QR码，甚至超越理论纠错极限，且能泛化到其他语言和随机字符串。模型主要关注数据位而非纠错位，解码机制与传统QR阅读器不同。

Conclusion: 研究表明Transformer能有效学习中等输入敏感性的QR码解码任务，展示了其强大的学习能力和独特的解码机制，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The hardness of learning a function that attains a target task relates to its
input-sensitivity. For example, image classification tasks are
input-insensitive as minor corruptions should not affect the classification
results, whereas arithmetic and symbolic computation, which have been recently
attracting interest, are highly input-sensitive as each input variable connects
to the computation results. This study presents the first learning-based Quick
Response (QR) code decoding and investigates learning functions of medium
sensitivity. Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode
QR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the
structure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to
other languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the
Transformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring
error-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard
QR code readers.

TL;DR: 研究发现机器学习模型记忆训练数据的问题不仅受自身影响，还受其他样本（尤其是近似重复样本）影响，仅关注自身影响会低估风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和泛化问题。传统方法仅关注样本自身对模型预测的影响（反事实自影响），但忽略了其他样本（如近似重复样本）的影响。

Method: 将反事实影响视为分布量，分析所有训练样本如何影响记忆。在小语言模型上计算训练样本间的完整影响分布，并分析其特性。

Result: 仅关注自影响会严重低估记忆风险：近似重复样本会降低自影响，但这些样本仍可被提取。图像分类中也观察到类似模式，影响分布能揭示CIFAR-10中的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 记忆源于训练数据间的复杂交互，完整影响分布比单独的自影响更能准确捕捉记忆现象。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training
data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual
self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the
model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in
the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be
affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in
particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization
treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into
account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a
small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training
samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking
at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with
memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces
self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We
observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the
influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.
Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across
training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by
self-influence alone.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ILDE的新型模仿学习算法，通过双重探索机制提高样本效率和超越专家性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在有限专家示范下难以准确学习复杂状态空间的策略，且需通过环境探索实现超越专家性能。

Method: ILDE算法结合两种探索：(1) 通过奖励高不确定性状态-动作对的乐观策略优化；(2) 对偏离示范轨迹状态的好奇驱动探索。

Result: 实验表明ILDE在Atari和MuJoCo任务上以更少示范实现超越现有方法的样本效率和超越专家性能，并给出理论证明。

Conclusion: ILDE作为一种不确定性正则化策略优化方法，通过乐观探索实现了次线性增长的遗憾，显著提升了模仿学习效果。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the
goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is
often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of
demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,
it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve
beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration
(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy
optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high
uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and
(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the
demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.
Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art
imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves
beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations
than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as
an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic
exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.

Method: 分析了一种简单的离策略REINFORCE算法，其中优势函数定义为A=r-V，通过调整基线V来优化策略改进。

Result: 理论分析表明，当基线V低于预期奖励时，算法具有策略改进保证。实验在随机多臂老虎机任务和大型语言模型微调中验证了这一点。

Conclusion: 离策略更新应更关注正奖励而非负奖励，调整基线V能有效优化策略改进，为大型语言模型对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language
models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and
data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal
performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms
between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple
off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with
$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$
emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more
heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE
algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,
the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that
while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,
off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on
negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled
stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on
reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA作为一种广泛使用的大型模型微调方法，其适配器放置策略对性能有重要影响。现有研究在适配器放置位置（如注意力模块或MLP模块）上存在分歧，缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过理论分析提出PLoP方法，能根据预训练模型和微调任务自动识别最优的LoRA适配器放置模块类型。

Result: 实验表明PLoP在监督微调和强化学习任务中始终优于或至少与常用放置策略相当。

Conclusion: PLoP提供了一种高效自动的适配器放置解决方案，解决了LoRA微调中的关键配置问题。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used finetuning method for large
models. Its small memory footprint allows practitioners to adapt large models
to specific tasks at a fraction of the cost of full finetuning. Different
modifications have been proposed to enhance its efficiency by, for example,
setting the learning rate, the rank, and the initialization. Another
improvement axis is adapter placement strategy: when using LoRA, practitioners
usually pick module types to adapt with LoRA, such as Query and Key modules.
Few works have studied the problem of adapter placement, with nonconclusive
results: original LoRA paper suggested placing adapters in attention modules,
while other works suggested placing them in the MLP modules. Through an
intuitive theoretical analysis, we introduce PLoP (Precise LoRA Placement), a
lightweight method that allows automatic identification of module types where
LoRA adapters should be placed, given a pretrained model and a finetuning task.
We demonstrate that PLoP consistently outperforms, and in the worst case
competes, with commonly used placement strategies through comprehensive
experiments on supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning for reasoning.

Conclusion: 置换等变神经图CDEs通过参数效率优化，实现了更高效的训练和更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Dynamic graphs exhibit complex temporal dynamics due to the interplay between
evolving node features and changing network structures. Recently, Graph Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Graph Neural CDEs) successfully adapted
Neural CDEs from paths on Euclidean domains to paths on graph domains. Building
on this foundation, we introduce Permutation Equivariant Neural Graph CDEs,
which project Graph Neural CDEs onto permutation equivariant function spaces.
This significantly reduces the model's parameter count without compromising
representational power, resulting in more efficient training and improved
generalisation. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our approach
through experiments on simulated dynamical systems and real-world tasks,
showing improved performance in both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios.

Abstract: We address fairness in the context of sequential bundle recommendation, where
users are served in turn with sets of relevant and compatible items. Motivated
by real-world scenarios, we formalize producer-fairness, that seeks to achieve
desired exposure of different item groups across users in a recommendation
session. Our formulation combines naturally with building high quality bundles.
Our problem is solved in real time as users arrive. We propose an exact
solution that caters to small instances of our problem. We then examine two
heuristics, quality-first and fairness-first, and an adaptive variant that
determines on-the-fly the right balance between bundle fairness and quality.
Our experiments on three real-world datasets underscore the strengths and
limitations of each solution and demonstrate their efficacy in providing fair
bundle recommendations without compromising bundle quality.

Motivation: 传统的线性向量自回归模型（VAR）在捕捉多元时间序列数据关联时存在局限性，而现有的深度学习方法将GC视为变量选择问题。本文旨在探索GC与预测之间的本质联系，提出一种新的GC学习方法。

Method: 通过深度神经网络联合建模时间序列数据，比较使用全部时间序列数据和剔除特定时间序列成分后的模型不确定性或残差分布，从而揭示GC结构。同时研究了输入层dropout对学习GC能力的影响。

Result: 研究表明，经过良好正则化的模型能够从数据中学习到真实的GC结构，而无需在损失函数中显式添加变量选择或稀疏回归的指导项。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的GC分析方法，通过深度学习和模型不确定性比较，能够有效学习GC结构，为多元时间序列分析提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.

Motivation: 现有基于SVD的压缩方法虽具有硬件兼容性和理论保证，但忽视了矩阵中关键组件的保护，导致压缩模型性能下降。

Method: 提出局部重要性保护（通过通道加权数据白化保留关键奇异向量）和全局重要性保护（通过启发式或优化方法分配压缩负担）的双级机制。

Result: 实验表明，DipSVD在多个基准测试中优于现有SVD压缩方法，尤其在高压缩率下表现优异。

Conclusion: DipSVD通过保护关键组件有效提升了SVD压缩的性能，为LLM压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large
language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to
quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware
compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods
focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices
while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix,
which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper
proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based
compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most
critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted
data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important
layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a
heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of
compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD
outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple
benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model
compression ratios.

Abstract: Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 轨迹数据特征爆炸导致机器学习模型效率与可解释性下降，需解决高维度带来的问题。

Method: 采用基于分类学的特征选择方法，将特征分为几何（曲率、凹陷）和运动学（速度、加速度）两类。

Result: 分类法显著减少特征选择时间，且预测性能优于或持平传统方法，同时增强数据敏感性分析。

Conclusion: 分类法为轨迹数据提供可解释、低复杂度的特征选择框架，推动可解释AI发展。

Abstract: Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also
of paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves
through space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the
significant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,
resulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and
predicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced
feature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of
the data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome
this issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,
the objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection
method that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This
approach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further
categorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The
comparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently
achieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the
taxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select
features was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights
into what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study
provides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add
a layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational
complexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step
toward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners
dealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of
explainable artificial intelligence.

are twofold: we precompute spectral augmentations through max-min
centrality-guided optimization, enabling rich structural supervision without
relying on handcrafted augmentations, then we integrate an adversarial
bootstrapped training scheme that further strengthens feature learning and
robustness. Our extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets show that
LaplaceGNN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
self-supervised graph methods, offering a promising direction for efficiently
learning expressive graph representations.

Abstract: Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth
observation (EO) applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting,
and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. We present TESSERA, a
novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) to generate global, robust representations at 10m scale from pixel-level
satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and
SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated
to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected
spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods
that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous,
resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning
in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient
knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience
against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by
developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to
deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring
differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution
employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client
similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage
differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models,
maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of
malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both
linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and
attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher
accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and
maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we
demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices,
where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of
overhead.

Conclusion: OPFV方法通过利用时间序列结构，有效解决了非平稳环境中的未来策略价值估计和优化问题，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We study the novel problem of future off-policy evaluation (F-OPE) and
learning (F-OPL) for estimating and optimizing the future value of policies in
non-stationary environments, where distributions vary over time. In e-commerce
recommendations, for instance, our goal is often to estimate and optimize the
policy value for the upcoming month using data collected by an old policy in
the previous month. A critical challenge is that data related to the future
environment is not observed in the historical data. Existing methods assume
stationarity or depend on restrictive reward-modeling assumptions, leading to
significant bias. To address these limitations, we propose a novel estimator
named \textit{\textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy Estimator for the \textbf{F}uture
\textbf{V}alue (\textbf{\textit{OPFV}})}, designed for accurately estimating
policy values at any future time point. The key feature of OPFV is its ability
to leverage the useful structure within time-series data. While future data
might not be present in the historical log, we can leverage, for example,
seasonal, weekly, or holiday effects that are consistent in both the historical
and future data. Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related
structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE.
Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes
low-bias. In addition, we extend our estimator to develop a new policy-gradient
method to proactively learn a good future policy using only historical data.
Empirical results show that our methods substantially outperform existing
methods in estimating and optimizing the future policy value under
non-stationarity for various experimental setups.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为KDIA的策略，通过知识蒸馏和师生不平等聚合方法，解决联邦学习中客户端标签偏斜和数据量偏斜等异构性问题，尤其适用于大规模客户端中仅少数参与训练的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法大多忽视了大规模客户端中仅少数参与训练的场景，而这种场景下的模型性能会因客户端标签偏斜、数据量偏斜等异构性问题而严重下降。因此，作者提出了一种新的策略来应对这一挑战。

Method: KDIA策略中，学生模型是参与客户端的平均聚合，而教师模型则是基于参与间隔、参与次数和数据量比例三个频率对所有客户端进行加权聚合。在本地训练时进行自知识蒸馏，并利用服务器训练的生成器生成近似独立同分布的数据特征进行辅助训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10数据集及多种异构设置下的实验表明，KDIA能在更少的训练轮次下达到更高的准确率，且在严重异构性下改进更为显著。

Conclusion: KDIA策略能有效利用所有客户端的知识，显著提升联邦学习在异构环境下的性能，尤其是在大规模客户端中仅少数参与训练的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to train a global model in a distributed environment
that is close to the performance of centralized training. However, issues such
as client label skew, data quantity skew, and other heterogeneity problems
severely degrade the model's performance. Most existing methods overlook the
scenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a
large-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario
presents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a
Knowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)
strategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,
which can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student
model is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the
teacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three
frequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume
proportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.
Additionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate
approximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features
locally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate
KDIA. The results show that KDIA can achieve better accuracy with fewer rounds
of training, and the improvement is more significant under severe
heterogeneity.

Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient way to
learn surrogate neural solvers of PDEs by embedding the physical model in the

so-called collocation points. Originally uniformly sampled, the choice of the
latter has been the subject of recent advances leading to adaptive sampling
refinements. In this paper, we propose a new quadrature method for
approximating definite integrals based on the hessian of the considered
function, and that we leverage to guide the selection of the collocation points
during the training process of PINNs.

Abstract: A fundamental question in applying In-Context Learning (ICL) for tabular data
classification is how to determine the ideal number of demonstrations in the
prompt. This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to
automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method
distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution
but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language
Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed
algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different
demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the
eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations
capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation
space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing
its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse
datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It
tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from
different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each
modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer
internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning,
and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core
techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from
different data types), alignment methods (to match information across
modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models).
Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like
dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and
defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new
methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to
make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on
designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it
easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field
continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand
the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal
with real-world complexity.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized collaborative Machine Learning
framework for training models without collecting data in a centralized
location. It has seen application across various disciplines, from helping
medical diagnoses in hospitals to detecting fraud in financial transactions. In
this paper, we focus on improving the local training process through hardware
usage optimization. While participants in a federation might share the hardware
they are training on, since there is no information exchange between them,
their training process can be hindered by an improper training configuration.
Taking advantage of the parallel processing inherent to Federated Learning, we
use a greedy randomized search to optimize local batch sizes for the best
training settings across all participants. Our results show that against
default parameter settings, our method improves convergence speed while staying
nearly on par with the case where local parameters are optimized.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm which
allows participants to collectively train a model while training data remains
private. This paradigm is especially beneficial for sectors like finance, where
data privacy, security and model performance are paramount. FL has been
extensively studied in the years following its introduction, leading to, among
others, better performing collaboration techniques, ways to defend against
other clients trying to attack the model, and contribution assessment methods.
An important element in for-profit Federated Learning is the development of
incentive methods to determine the allocation and distribution of rewards for
participants. While numerous methods for allocation have been proposed and
thoroughly explored, distribution frameworks remain relatively understudied. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework which introduces client-specific
tokens as investment vehicles within the FL ecosystem. Our framework aims to
address the limitations of existing incentive schemes by leveraging a
decentralized finance (DeFi) platform and automated market makers (AMMs) to
create a more flexible and scalable reward distribution system for
participants, and a mechanism for third parties to invest in the federation
learning process.

Conclusion: SIDED数据集和AMDA方法有效解决了工业NILM中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，为复杂工业设备的能耗分解提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.

Abstract: Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.

Abstract: This paper is about optimally controlling skill-based queueing systems such

case study using a real-world data set, we investigate the practical
implementation of a recently developed reinforcement learning algorithm for
optimal customer routing. Our experiments show that the algorithm efficiently
learns and adapts to changing environments and outperforms static benchmark

real-world applicability of this algorithm by introducing a new heuristic
routing rule to reduce delays. Moreover, we show that the algorithm can
optimize for multiple objectives: next to payoff maximization, secondary
objectives such as server load fairness and customer waiting time reduction can
be incorporated. Tuning parameters are used for balancing inherent performance
trade--offs. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity to estimation errors and
parameter tuning, providing valuable insights for implementing adaptive routing
algorithms in complex real-world queueing systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is an important problem across
various fields such as healthcare, financial services, manufacturing or physics
detector monitoring. Accurately identifying when unexpected errors or faults
occur is essential, yet challenging, due to the unknown nature of anomalies and
the complex interdependencies between time series dimensions. In this paper, we

focusing on the recently proposed iTransformer architecture. Our contributions
are fourfold: (i) we explore the application of the iTransformer to time series
anomaly detection, and analyse the influence of key parameters such as window
size, step size, and model dimensions on performance; (ii) we examine methods
for extracting anomaly labels from multidimensional anomaly scores and discuss
appropriate evaluation metrics for such labels; (iii) we study the impact of
anomalous data present during training and assess the effectiveness of
alternative loss functions in mitigating their influence; and (iv) we present a
comprehensive comparison of several transformer-based models across a diverse
set of datasets for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Deep learning on graphs has shown remarkable success across numerous
applications, including social networks, bio-physics, traffic networks, and
recommendation systems. Regardless of their successes, current methods
frequently depend on the assumption that training and testing data share the
same distribution, a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. While
graph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional
message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)
benchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of
backbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in
OOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading
domain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their
performance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.
Our results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently
demonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without
specialized DG algorithms.
  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that
compares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,
specifically examining domain alignment and class separation. Demonstrating its
model-agnostic design, this approach not only provided meaningful insights into
GT and MPNN backbones. It also shows promise for broader applicability to DG
problems beyond graph learning, offering a deeper perspective on generalization
abilities that goes beyond standard accuracy metrics. Together, our findings
highlight the promise of graph-transformers for robust, real-world graph
learning and set a new direction for future research in OOD generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型图索引SVG，利用核方法构建适用于度量与非度量向量空间的图结构，并引入SVG-L0实现有界出度，相比传统方法更具理论保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图索引的导航性保证仅适用于欧氏空间，无法直接推广到度量或非度量空间（如内积相似性）。论文旨在通过机器学习方法构建更通用的图索引。

Method: 1. 提出支持向量图(SVG)，利用核方法建立图连接性；2. 将HNSW等流行索引解释为SVG的特例；3. 设计SVG-L0，通过ℓ0稀疏约束控制出度。

Result: SVG在度量/非度量空间均具有理论导航性保证；SVG-L0实现了出度限制的自适应调节，避免了传统启发式截断方法的缺陷。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法可构建通用图索引，SVG框架为新型索引设计提供理论基础，SVG-L0通过稀疏约束实现了更优雅的工程实践。

Abstract: The most popular graph indices for vector search use principles from
computational geometry to build the graph. Hence, their formal graph
navigability guarantees are only valid in Euclidean space. In this work, we
show that machine learning can be used to build graph indices for vector search
in metric and non-metric vector spaces (e.g., for inner product similarity).
From this novel perspective, we introduce the Support Vector Graph (SVG), a new
type of graph index that leverages kernel methods to establish the graph
connectivity and that comes with formal navigability guarantees valid in metric
and non-metric vector spaces. In addition, we interpret the most popular graph
indices, including HNSW and DiskANN, as particular specializations of SVG and
show that new indices can be derived from the principles behind this
specialization. Finally, we propose SVG-L0 that incorporates an $\ell_0$
sparsity constraint into the SVG kernel method to build graphs with a bounded
out-degree. This yields a principled way of implementing this practical
requirement, in contrast to the traditional heuristic of simply truncating the
out edges of each node. Additionally, we show that SVG-L0 has a self-tuning
property that avoids the heuristic of using a set of candidates to find the
out-edges of each node and that keeps its computational complexity in check.

<details>

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在捕捉复杂哈密顿函数和保持能量守恒方面存在困难，因此需要一种更有效的方法来学习哈密顿系统的控制方程。

Method: 采用有限表达式方法（H-FEX），引入新型交互节点以有效捕捉复杂的交互项。

Result: 实验表明，H-FEX能够恢复复杂系统的哈密顿函数，准确捕捉系统动力学并在长时间范围内保持能量守恒。

Conclusion: H-FEX作为一种强大框架，具有发现复杂动力系统闭式表达式的潜力。

Abstract: Hamiltonian systems describe a broad class of dynamical systems governed by
Hamiltonian functions, which encode the total energy and dictate the evolution
of the system. Data-driven approaches, such as symbolic regression and neural
network-based methods, provide a means to learn the governing equations of
dynamical systems directly from observational data of Hamiltonian systems.
However, these methods often struggle to accurately capture complex Hamiltonian
functions while preserving energy conservation. To overcome this limitation, we
propose the Finite Expression Method for learning Hamiltonian Systems (H-FEX),
a symbolic learning method that introduces novel interaction nodes designed to
capture intricate interaction terms effectively. Our experiments, including
those on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover
Hamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system
dynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight
the potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form
expressions of complex dynamical systems.

Motivation: 研究闭环学习中模型参数动态，特别是大神经网络可能主要依赖自身生成数据训练的情况。

Method: 推导指数族模型的运动方程，分析最大似然估计和最大后验估计对参数动态的影响。

Result: 最大似然估计使充分统计量具有鞅性质，导致吸收态放大初始偏差；但可通过微小数据污染、最大后验估计或正则化防止。

Conclusion: 闭环学习的渐进行为不是重参数不变的，需谨慎处理以避免偏差放大。

Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from
data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to
the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be
primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves.
We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving
equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that
maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics
with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to
absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we
show that this outcome may be prevented by polluting the data with an
infinitesimal fraction of data points generated from a fixed model, by relying
on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.
Furthermore, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics is not
reparametrisation invariant.

Conclusion: FedEDS通过加密数据共享机制有效提升了联邦学习在边缘设备上的性能，为隐私保护和高效模型训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being
trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through
Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of
network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices,
leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To
address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge
devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).
FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data
encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other
clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and
encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's
local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the
model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning
training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it
suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid
convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model
performance.

Abstract: The problem of learning to defer with multiple experts consists of optimally
assigning input instances to experts, balancing the trade-off between their
accuracy and computational cost. This is a critical challenge in natural
language generation, but also in other fields such as image processing, and
medical diagnostics. Recent studies have proposed surrogate loss functions to
optimize deferral, but challenges remain in ensuring their consistency
properties. This paper introduces novel surrogate loss functions and efficient
algorithms with strong theoretical learning guarantees. We address open
questions regarding realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency bounds, and
Bayes-consistency for both single-stage (jointly learning predictor and
deferral function) and two-stage (learning only the deferral function with a
fixed expert) learning scenarios. For single-stage deferral, we introduce a
family of new realizable $H$-consistent surrogate losses and further prove
$H$-consistency for a selected member. For two-stage deferral, we derive new
surrogate losses that achieve realizable $H$-consistency, $H$-consistency
bounds, and Bayes-consistency for the two-expert scenario and, under natural
assumptions, multiple-expert scenario. Additionally, we provide enhanced
theoretical guarantees under low-noise assumptions for both scenarios. Finally,
we report the results of experiments using our proposed surrogate losses,
comparing their performance against existing baselines.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的梯度更新可能无意中泄露客户端的敏感信息，尤其是当恶意服务器操纵全局模型以获取信息丰富的更新时。论文从防御者的角度出发，探讨了此类攻击的局限性和可检测性。

Method: 论文首先分析了恶意梯度泄露攻击的核心权衡（效果与隐蔽性），然后提出了一种轻量级的客户端检测机制，用于在本地训练开始前标记可疑的模型更新。

Result: 研究发现，恶意梯度泄露攻击在实际联邦学习设置中（如包含归一化技术和联邦平均）效果有限且易被检测。提出的检测机制进一步证明了防御此类攻击的可行性。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论：恶意梯度泄露攻击虽然理论上有风险，但实际应用中受限且可检测。提出的检测机制为隐私敏感的联邦学习系统提供了可部署的保障。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that gradient updates in federated learning (FL) can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about a client's local data. This
risk becomes significantly greater when a malicious server manipulates the
global model to provoke information-rich updates from clients. In this paper,
we adopt a defender's perspective to provide the first comprehensive analysis
of malicious gradient leakage attacks and the model manipulation techniques
that enable them. Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks
cannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently
stealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that
incorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.
  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,
while theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often
detectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we
propose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection
mechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,
despite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic
FL settings. This mechanism further underscores the feasibility of defending
against these attacks with minimal overhead, offering a deployable safeguard
for privacy-conscious federated learning systems.

Abstract: A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment
conventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML)
models. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation
($\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and
analysis of $\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this
paper, we revisit $\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We
first establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\Omega(\kappa \cdot
\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\epsilon$-PLA
fitting algorithms, where $\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then
present a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-PLA algorithms
when used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key
trade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing
actionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data
structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风电场控制方法独立优化单台风机功率，忽略了尾流协同效应。现有优化方法多依赖静态低精度模拟，无法捕捉湍流动态特性。

Method: 将强化学习控制器与高保真大涡模拟（LES）直接结合，实现实时响应大气湍流的动态协同控制策略。

Result: 强化学习控制器使风电场发电量提升4.30%，是贝叶斯优化静态偏航控制增益（2.19%）的近两倍。

Conclusion: 动态流响应控制为风电场优化带来变革性突破，对加速实现净零排放的可再生能源部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize
individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire
farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production.
Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control
applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static,
low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this
work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated
directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time
response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control
strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power
output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from
static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These
results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach
to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable
energy deployment to net-zero targets.

Motivation: 随着设备端大型语言模型(LLM)推理需求的增长，能效成为关键问题，尤其是电池有限的移动设备。现有工作多关注预填充阶段加速，忽视了内存绑定的解码阶段能耗。

Method: 提出自适应能效核心选择(AECS)方法，集成到MNN中形成MNN-AECS系统，无需root权限或系统修改，动态选择低功耗CPU核心优化解码能效。

Result: 在7台设备上测试5种LLM，相比原MNN平均节能23%；对比其他引擎节能39%-78%，提速12%-363%。

Conclusion: MNN-AECS是首个系统级解决方案，有效平衡LLM解码能耗与速度，为移动设备提供高效能推理支持。

Abstract: As the demand for on-device Large Language Model (LLM) inference grows,
energy efficiency has become a major concern, especially for battery-limited
mobile devices. Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase
dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the
prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric
Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient
version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring
root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is
designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an
acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores.
MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of
various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23%
without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other
engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS
delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.

Result: 在PDBbind2020、DockGen等基准测试中，PocketVina在物理有效性（PB-valid）和RMSD上均达到领先水平，且能有效区分活性与非活性靶点。

Conclusion: PocketVina为高通量虚拟筛选和基于结构的药物发现提供了稳健、可扩展的对接策略。

Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in
molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We
introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking
framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket
exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established
benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and
PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically
valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when
jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while
remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD
alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets.
PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy
across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce
TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000
protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem
activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully
discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning
baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina
offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific
training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for
high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.

Motivation: 化学键断裂的可靠描述是量子化学中的主要挑战，因为解离物种的电子结构具有多参考性。传统多参考方法计算成本高，且无法利用分子间电子结构的共性。

Method: 采用量子蒙特卡洛与深度神经网络（deep QMC）结合的方法，预训练可转移的波函数模型Orbformer，利用分子间电子结构的共性。

Result: Orbformer在已建立的基准测试、更具挑战性的键解离和Diels-Alder反应中，是唯一能持续收敛到化学精度（1 kcal/mol）的方法。

Conclusion: 该工作将‘分摊求解薛定谔方程成本’的理念转化为量子化学中的实用方法，为量子化学计算提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Reliable description of bond breaking remains a major challenge for quantum
chemistry due to the multireferential character of the electronic structure in
dissociating species. Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large
computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for
each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure
across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC)
uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable
wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here,
we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable
wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures
that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio
rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well
as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is
the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).
This work turns the idea of amortizing the cost of solving the Schr\"odinger
equation over many molecules into a practical approach in quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing
prediction sets with coverage guarantees. In practice, multiple valid conformal
prediction sets may be available, arising from different models or
methodologies. However, selecting the most desirable set, such as the smallest,
can invalidate the coverage guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a
stability-based approach that ensures coverage for the selected prediction set.
We extend our results to the online conformal setting, propose several
refinements in settings where additional structure is available, and
demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments.

Method: 采用Anisotropic Diffusion Maps这一非线性流形学习技术，通过线性扩散近似嵌入动态，并利用卡尔曼滤波从扩散映射嵌入空间直接预测协变量和响应变量的演化。

Conclusion: 本文提出的数据驱动框架不仅理论上严谨，且在实际应用中表现出色，特别是在金融压力测试领域，为高维动态系统的建模和预测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven dynamic factor framework where a response variable
depends on a high-dimensional set of covariates, without imposing any
parametric model on the joint dynamics. Leveraging Anisotropic Diffusion Maps,
a nonlinear manifold learning technique introduced by Singer and Coifman, our
framework uncovers the joint dynamics of the covariates and responses in a
purely data-driven way. We approximate the embedding dynamics using linear
diffusions, and exploit Kalman filtering to predict the evolution of the
covariates and response variables directly from the diffusion map embedding
space. We generalize Singer's convergence rate analysis of the graph Laplacian
from the case of independent uniform samples on a compact manifold to the case
of time series arising from Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space.
Furthermore, we provide rigorous justification for our procedure by showing the
robustness of approximations of the diffusion map coordinates by linear
diffusions, and the convergence of ergodic averages under standard spectral
assumptions on the underlying dynamics. We apply our method to the stress
testing of equity portfolios using a combination of financial and macroeconomic
factors from the Federal Reserve's supervisory scenarios. We demonstrate that
our data-driven stress testing method outperforms standard scenario analysis
and Principal Component Analysis benchmarks through historical backtests
spanning three major financial crises, achieving reductions in mean absolute
error of up to 55% and 39% for scenario-based portfolio return prediction,
respectively.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE) focuses
on estimating the return distribution of a target policy using offline data
collected under a different policy. This work focuses on extending the widely
used fitted-Q evaluation -- developed for expectation-based reinforcement
learning -- to the distributional OPE setting. We refer to this extension as
fitted distributional evaluation (FDE). While only a few related approaches
exist, there remains no unified framework for designing FDE methods. To fill
this gap, we present a set of guiding principles for constructing theoretically
grounded FDE methods. Building on these principles, we develop several new FDE
methods with convergence analysis and provide theoretical justification for
existing methods, even in non-tabular environments. Extensive experiments,
including simulations on linear quadratic regulators and Atari games,
demonstrate the superior performance of the FDE methods.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their
accuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel
at prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful
relationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of
decision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can
be manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the
response. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control
the number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which
improves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve
optimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for
computing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to
varying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error
bounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the
best data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to
the same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the
large-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the
oracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms
existing algorithms for rule extraction.

*Ruijia Zhang,Zhengling Qi,Yue Wu,Xiangyu Zhang,Yanxun Xu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: POLAR是一种新型的悲观模型策略学习算法，用于优化离线动态治疗策略，通过量化不确定性并引入悲观惩罚，提供统计和计算保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态治疗策略（DTRs）方法在部分数据覆盖下缺乏鲁棒性，且离线强化学习方法缺乏统计保证和计算效率。POLAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: POLAR从离线数据估计转移动态，量化每个历史-动作对的不确定性，并在奖励函数中引入悲观惩罚以减少高不确定性动作的影响。

Result: POLAR在合成数据和MIMIC-III数据集上表现优于现有方法，提供接近最优的历史感知治疗策略，并具有有限样本下的策略次优性理论保证。

Conclusion: POLAR是首个同时提供统计和计算保证的基于模型的DTR方法，适用于医疗、教育等领域，优化了离线决策过程。

Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for
optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt
over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare,
education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods
often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial
data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus
on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require
solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose
POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline
DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and
quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is
then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high
uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training
performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned
policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally
intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our
knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both
statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on
policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ℓ0正则化方法，用于线性混合模型（LMMs）的子集选择，能够高效处理数千个预测变量，填补了现有稀疏学习方法在LMMs中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模的增大，尤其是包含数千个候选预测变量的情况，现有的稀疏学习方法在处理线性混合模型时效率不足，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 论文开发了一种坐标下降算法作为主要工具，并提供了其收敛性保证；同时提出了一种局部搜索算法以优化非凸优化表面。这些算法还可扩展到广义LMMs的子集选择。

Result: 新方法在合成实验中表现出色，并在生物学和新闻学的两个数据集中展示了其实际应用价值。同时，论文还提供了新方法的有限样本Kullback-Leibler散度边界。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的ℓ0正则化方法显著提升了线性混合模型在高维数据中的稀疏学习和子集选择效率，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are
key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine or
adaptive marketing. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes
containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for
prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for
LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large
gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random
effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for
LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of
predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a
coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of
its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the
nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset
selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation.
On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its
excellent performance in synthetic experiments and illustrate its utility on
two datasets from biology and journalism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鲁棒子空间估计是机器学习和数据分析的基础任务，但现有IRLS方法的理论性质尚不明确，缺乏全局收敛保证。

Method: 采用动态平滑正则化的IRLS变体，在确定性条件下进行理论分析，并拓展到黎曼流形上的非凸优化问题。

Result: 证明了该方法能从任意初始点线性收敛到真实子空间，首次为仿射子空间估计提供恢复理论，并在神经网络训练中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为IRLS在非凸优化问题中的应用奠定了理论基础，特别是在鲁棒子空间恢复领域实现了理论突破。

Abstract: Robust subspace estimation is fundamental to many machine learning and data
analysis tasks. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an elegant and
empirically effective approach to this problem, yet its theoretical properties
remain poorly understood. This paper establishes that, under deterministic
conditions, a variant of IRLS with dynamic smoothing regularization converges
linearly to the underlying subspace from any initialization. We extend these
guarantees to affine subspace estimation, a setting that lacks prior recovery
theory. Additionally, we illustrate the practical benefits of IRLS through an
application to low-dimensional neural network training. Our results provide the
first global convergence guarantees for IRLS in robust subspace recovery and,
more broadly, for nonconvex IRLS on a Riemannian manifold.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了学习者无关的鲁棒数据预过滤（LARP）框架，旨在通过预过滤保护下游学习器免受低质量数据影响，尽管会带来一定的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中常含有低质量或污染数据，影响学习算法的性能。因此，需要开发一种与学习器无关的鲁棒预过滤方法，以保护下游学习任务。

Method: 论文提出了LARP框架，通过最小化预定义学习器集合上的最坏情况损失来实现数据预过滤，并在Huber污染模型下进行了实例化分析。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，LARP在异构学习器集合上会导致性能损失，但通过博弈论框架权衡了预过滤成本与效用下降的关系，证明其在大数据集上的优势。

Conclusion: LARP为数据预过滤提供了一种通用方法，尽管会牺牲部分性能，但在处理大规模数据集时具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind
the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods.
However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to
which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of
whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate
downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction
of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in
the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners
from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic
Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures
that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first
instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber
estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness
result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering
procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a
heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared
to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.
We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem
parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,
observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the
trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)
prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP
for large datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用大语言模型（LLMs）的序列信息处理能力，导致推荐任务性能不佳。

Method: CoVE系统为每个项目分配唯一ID，扩展词汇表，并压缩嵌入层，以利用LLMs的序列理解能力。

Result: 在多个推荐数据集上的实验表明，CoVE显著提升了性能，并适用于大规模工业应用。

Conclusion: CoVE通过有效利用LLMs的序列理解能力，显著提升了推荐任务的性能，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in providing relevant content to
users. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), researchers
have begun utilizing LLMs to build more powerful recommender systems. However,
existing approaches that focus on aligning LLMs with recommendation tasks do
not fully leverage their sequential information processing capabilities,
leading to suboptimal performance.
  In this paper, we propose a novel system called compressed vocabulary
expansion (CoVE). In CoVE, each item is assigned a unique ID within the
expanded vocabulary. Our framework effectively capitalizes on sequence
understanding abilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance on
recommendation tasks. Additionally, we compress the embedding layer, making
CoVE practical for large-scale industrial applications. The effectiveness and
performance of CoVE are demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on
multiple recommendation datasets and comparisons with prior works. Our code can
be found at https://github.com/HaochenZhang717/CoVE-official-Repo.

TL;DR: 提出FemmIR框架，通过无监督方式实现多模态检索，避免标注成本，并在新数据集MuQNOL上验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检索方法依赖标注数据或模态映射，成本高且不灵活。本文旨在利用预训练模型，避免标注开销，实现无监督多模态检索。

Method: FemmIR框架基于样本间编辑距离的弱监督信号，通过多级交互评分衡量查询与数据的相关性，复用预训练编码器的高层属性。

Result: 在MuQNOL数据集上的实验表明，FemmIR在精确和近似相似度检索任务中表现与现有系统相当，且无需微调。

Conclusion: FemmIR提供了一种无标注、可跨应用复用的多模态检索方案，为数据稀缺场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing multi-media retrieval models either rely on creating a common
subspace with modality-specific representation models or require schema mapping
among modalities to measure similarities among multi-media data. Our goal is to
avoid the annotation overhead incurred from considering retrieval as a
supervised classification task and re-use the pretrained encoders in large
language models and vision tasks. We propose "FemmIR", a framework to retrieve
multimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal
queries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is
necessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and
satisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common
framework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for
benchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision
introduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be
modified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its
properties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the
amount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding
networks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property
value and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between
data samples and the query example provided by the user. We empirically
evaluate FemmIR on a missing person use case with MuQNOL. FemmIR performs
comparably to similar retrieval systems in delivering on-demand retrieval
results with exact and approximate similarities while using the existing
property identifiers in the system.

Result: 发现文档位置交换或特征分布重叠是参数恢复的必要条件，日志策略在模型不完美时会放大偏差。

Conclusion: 样本加权技术可有效缓解偏差，为双塔模型的研究与实践提供实用建议。

Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling
biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a
concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by
well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This
paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding
effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We
theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models,
showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature
distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also
investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that
they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However,
logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user
behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement
across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these
effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using
two-tower models.

Conclusion: 通过这种方法，论文为理解可视化设计原理提供了新的视角和工具，弥补了现有研究在探究设计编码方面的不足。

Abstract: Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks
such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and
visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies
often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and
artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the
interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather
than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and
methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural
language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural
language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as
part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts
with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind
their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate
and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and
articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and
curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices
and corresponding rationales of the students.

Motivation: 当前AI代码助手缺乏解释其建议的能力，导致开发者难以评估输出、形成准确心智模型并建立校准信任。

Method: 引入CopilotLens作为解释层，通过动态界面展示AI代理的“思考过程”，包括高层次计划和代码库上下文。

Result: CopilotLens将代码补全从简单建议转变为透明、可解释的事件，促进更深层次的理解和更稳健的人机协作。

Conclusion: CopilotLens为未来注重推理清晰度的代理代码助手提供了具体框架，优先考虑建议的透明度而非速度。

Abstract: AI-powered code assistants are widely used to generate code completions,
significantly boosting developer productivity. However, these tools typically
present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their
decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability
to critically evaluate the output, form accurate mental models, and build
calibrated trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a
novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple
suggestion into a transparent, explainable event. CopilotLens operates as an
explanation layer that reveals the AI agent's "thought process" through a
dynamic two-level interface, surfacing everything from its reconstructed
high-level plans to the specific codebase context influencing the code. This
paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete
framework for building future agentic code assistants that prioritize clarity
of reasoning over speed of suggestion, thereby fostering deeper comprehension
and more robust human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: Insight Recall范式及Irec系统能有效增强元认知与自我调节能力，为智能学习工具设计开辟新方向。

Abstract: The core challenge in learning has shifted from knowledge acquisition to
effective Self-Regulated Learning (SRL): planning, monitoring, and reflecting
on one's learning. Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support
metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized
review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management
(PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.
  To address these challenges, this paper introduces "Insight Recall," a novel
paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past
insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm
using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a
prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses
a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a
new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal "insights."
Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity
assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time
manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline
for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional "Guided
Inquiry" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert
LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context. The
contribution of this paper is a solid theoretical framework and a usable system
platform for designing next-generation intelligent learning systems that
enhance metacognition and self-regulation.

Abstract: The ubiquity of technologies like ChatGPT has raised concerns about their
impact on student writing, particularly regarding reduced learner agency and
superficial engagement with content. While standalone chat-based LLMs often
produce suboptimal writing outcomes, evidence suggests that purposefully
designed AI writing support tools can enhance the writing process. This paper
investigates how different AI support approaches affect writers' sense of
agency and depth of knowledge transformation. Through a randomized control
trial with 90 undergraduate students, we compare three conditions: (1) a
chat-based LLM writing assistant, (2) an integrated AI writing tool to support
diverse subprocesses, and (3) a standard writing interface (control). Our
findings demonstrate that, among AI-supported conditions, students using the
integrated AI writing tool exhibited greater agency over their writing process
and engaged in deeper knowledge transformation overall. These results suggest
that thoughtfully designed AI writing support targeting specific aspects of the
writing process can help students maintain ownership of their work while
facilitating improved engagement with content.

Motivation: 现有的MaxWeight分析仅保证稳定性和在重负载下的渐近最优性，但未考虑有限时间内的性能。论文旨在填补这一空白，研究调度策略在有限时间内的最优性能。

Method: 论文采用极小极大框架，识别影响策略有限时间性能的参数，提出信息论下界，并设计了一种新的调度规则，最小化Lyapunov漂移（包括其二阶项）。

Result: 研究发现MaxWeight在有限时间内可能因问题相关因素导致更大的积压，而新提出的调度规则在特定条件下能够匹配信息论下界。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了仅依赖漂移方法的局限性，为队列控制中的非渐近最优性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and
derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling
problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and
stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and
asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons,
MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which
we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the
precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2)
an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental
limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new
scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its
second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up
to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on
"drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic
optimality in queueing control.

Abstract: Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the
optimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely
open. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study
of the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we
first provide a closed-form expression of all critical points. Building on
this, we establish precise conditions under which a critical point is a local
minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point, or a non-strict saddle
point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition
under which each critical point is either a local minimizer or a strict saddle
point. This provides insights into why gradient-based methods almost always
converge to a local minimizer of the regularized DMF problem. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments to visualize its loss landscape under different
settings to support our theory.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of stochastic and finite-sum convex
optimization problems with deterministic constraints. Existing methods
typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-$expectedly\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
solution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality
gap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\epsilon$. However, in many
practical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,
rendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial
violations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods
for finding an $\epsilon$-$surely\ feasible\ stochastic\ optimal$
($\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically
bounded by $\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\epsilon$.
Our methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified
variance-reduced ASG scheme $only\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty
subproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish

TL;DR: LLMs能有效处理政府遗留代码（如ALC/MUMPS），其自动分块方法生成的文档比人工分块更准确实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs未充分解决政府遗留代码（如ALC/MUMPS）的挑战，包括超长上下文和缺乏训练数据的问题。

Method: 研究不同代码分块方法对LLMs生成遗留代码摘要的影响，测试模型包括GPT-4o、Claude 3等。

Result: LLMs选择的分割点与专家一致，其生成的文档事实准确性提高20%，实用性提高10%。

Conclusion: LLMs可替代人工分块，助力大规模遗留代码现代化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,
especially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,
existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code
written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise
software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language
code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context
window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are
primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited
testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy
languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines
the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written
in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We
investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary
module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking
methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs
can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We
also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks
such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that
are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create
partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable
replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided
modernization.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的半自动化方法，用于BIM中的规范检查，显著减少了时间和错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的手动代码合规性检查在BIM中耗时且容易出错，因此需要一种更高效、准确的方法来改进这一关键流程。

Method: 研究整合了GPT、Claude、Gemini和Llama等LLM与Revit软件，通过解释建筑规范、生成Python脚本并在BIM环境中进行半自动化合规检查。

Result: 案例研究表明，该系统能够减少合规检查的时间和精力，提高准确性，并自动识别违规情况，如不合规的房间尺寸、材料使用和对象放置。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于BIM的合规检查提供了一种全面、适应性强且经济高效的解决方案，有望在建筑项目的多样化监管文件中得到广泛应用。

Abstract: This research addresses the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual
code compliance checking in Building Information Modeling (BIM) by introducing
a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approach to semi-automate this critical
process. The developed system integrates LLMs such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and
Llama, with Revit software to interpret building codes, generate Python
scripts, and perform semi-automated compliance checks within the BIM
environment. Case studies on a single-family residential project and an office
building project demonstrated the system's ability to reduce the time and
effort required for compliance checks while improving accuracy. It streamlined
the identification of violations, such as non-compliant room dimensions,
material usage, and object placements, by automatically assessing relationships
and generating actionable reports. Compared to manual methods, the system
eliminated repetitive tasks, simplified complex regulations, and ensured
reliable adherence to standards. By offering a comprehensive, adaptable, and
cost-effective solution, this proposed approach offers a promising advancement
in BIM-based compliance checking, with potential applications across diverse
regulatory documents in construction projects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Define-ML框架，扩展了Lean Inception方法，通过结构化活动整合数据和ML技术考量，以解决ML产品构思中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在软件系统中的广泛应用，传统构思方法如Lean Inception缺乏对ML特有挑战（如数据依赖性和技术可行性）的支持，导致产品愿景与实际情况脱节。

Method: 基于技术转移模型开发并验证Define-ML框架，通过静态验证（玩具问题）和动态验证（工业案例研究）结合定量与定性分析，评估其实用性和易用性。

Result: 参与者认为Define-ML能有效澄清数据问题、对齐ML能力与业务目标，并促进跨职能协作，但ML特定组件存在学习曲线，需专家辅助。所有参与者均表示愿意采用该框架。

Conclusion: Define-ML提供了一个公开可用的验证方法，在保持Lean Inception敏捷性的同时，增强了数据与技术可行性的考量，适用于ML产品构思。

Abstract: [Context] The increasing adoption of machine learning (ML) in software
systems demands specialized ideation approaches that address ML-specific
challenges, including data dependencies, technical feasibility, and alignment
between business objectives and probabilistic system behavior. Traditional
ideation methods like Lean Inception lack structured support for these ML
considerations, which can result in misaligned product visions and unrealistic
expectations. [Goal] This paper presents Define-ML, a framework that extends
Lean Inception with tailored activities - Data Source Mapping, Feature-to-Data
Source Mapping, and ML Mapping - to systematically integrate data and technical
constraints into early-stage ML product ideation. [Method] We developed and
validated Define-ML following the Technology Transfer Model, conducting both
static validation (with a toy problem) and dynamic validation (in a real-world
industrial case study). The analysis combined quantitative surveys with
qualitative feedback, assessing utility, ease of use, and intent of adoption.
[Results] Participants found Define-ML effective for clarifying data concerns,
aligning ML capabilities with business goals, and fostering cross-functional
collaboration. The approach's structured activities reduced ideation ambiguity,
though some noted a learning curve for ML-specific components, which can be
mitigated by expert facilitation. All participants expressed the intention to
adopt Define-ML. [Conclusion] Define-ML provides an openly available, validated
approach for ML product ideation, building on Lean Inception's agility while
aligning features with available data and increasing awareness of technical
feasibility.

Motivation: 传统的光子器件开发方法在计算成本、实现难度和优化复杂性方面存在挑战，机器学习的出现为解决这些问题提供了新的数据驱动策略。

Method: 论文提出了一种结合机器学习的方法（ML-PDD），包括替代估计器加速计算、生成建模用于噪声测量建模和数据增强、强化学习用于制造以及主动学习用于实验物理发现。

Conclusion: 该综述为来自不同背景的研究人员提供了对这一新兴主题的宝贵见解，促进了跨学科合作，加速了复杂光子器件和系统的开发。

Abstract: Photonic device development (PDD) has achieved remarkable success in
designing and implementing new devices for controlling light across various
wavelengths, scales, and applications, including telecommunications, imaging,
sensing, and quantum information processing. PDD is an iterative, five-step
process that consists of: i) deriving device behavior from design parameters,
ii) simulating device performance, iii) finding the optimal candidate designs
from simulations, iv) fabricating the optimal device, and v) measuring device
performance. Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,
material science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.
However, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily
costly, or difficult to implement at scale. In addition, PDD suffers from large
optimization landscapes, uncertainties in structural or optical
characterization, and difficulties in implementing robust fabrication
processes. However, the advent of machine learning over the past decade has
provided novel, data-driven strategies for tackling these challenges, including
surrogate estimators for speeding up computations, generative modeling for
noisy measurement modeling and data augmentation, reinforcement learning for
fabrication, and active learning for experimental physical discovery. In this
review, we present a comprehensive perspective on these methods to enable
machine-learning-assisted PDD (ML-PDD) for efficient design optimization with
powerful generative models, fast simulation and characterization modeling under
noisy measurements, and reinforcement learning for fabrication. This review
will provide researchers from diverse backgrounds with valuable insights into
this emerging topic, fostering interdisciplinary efforts to accelerate the
development of complex photonic devices and systems.

Motivation: AI顶会投稿量激增导致强制实施投稿限制和简单ID顺序拒稿政策，虽减轻审稿负担但可能误拒优质论文。作者探讨如何在遵守限制下最小化无意义拒稿。

Method: 将当前拒稿政策形式化为优化问题，开发基于线性规划松弛和舍入方案的实用算法。

Result: 在11年ICLR真实数据测试中，该方法在不违反作者投稿限制前提下多保留19.23%论文，且计算效率高（最长53.64秒完成）。

Conclusion: 该策略显著减少不必要拒稿，为改进计算机科学会议投稿政策提供实用方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth of AI research has driven paper submissions at flagship
AI conferences to unprecedented levels, necessitating many venues in 2025
(e.g., CVPR, ICCV, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM) to enforce strict per-author
submission limits and to desk-reject any excess papers by simple ID order.
While this policy helps reduce reviewer workload, it may unintentionally
discard valuable papers and penalize authors' efforts. In this paper, we ask an
essential research question on whether it is possible to follow submission
limits while minimizing needless rejections. We first formalize the current
desk-rejection policies as an optimization problem, and then develop a
practical algorithm based on linear programming relaxation and a rounding
scheme. Under extensive evaluation on 11 years of real-world ICLR
(International Conference on Learning Representations) data, our method
preserves up to $19.23\%$ more papers without violating any author limits.
Moreover, our algorithm is highly efficient in practice, with all results on
ICLR data computed within at most 53.64 seconds. Our work provides a simple and
practical desk-rejection strategy that significantly reduces unnecessary
rejections, demonstrating strong potential to improve current CS conference
submission policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无损压缩中顺序模式（反向适应）的探索与利用权衡问题，并改进现有方法的局限性。

Method: 将顺序模式重新建模为多臂老虎机问题，提出鲁棒的成本导向多臂老虎机算法。

Result: 证明了现有方法的局限性，并提出了适用于任意块长度的鲁棒算法。

Conclusion: 鲁棒的成本导向算法在无损压缩中表现更优，解决了短块性能和鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch
mode (forward adaptation), or in a sequential mode (backward adaptation). We
recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model
in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed
"natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB
algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in
terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze
robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.

*Sergio Torres Aguilar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了五种先进的目标检测架构在三个历史文档数据集上的表现，发现模型性能受架构、数据集特性和边界框表示影响显著，CNN-OBB模型在复杂文档上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过比较不同目标检测架构在复杂历史文档布局分析中的表现，为自动处理和理解这些文档提供更优解决方案。

Method: 使用三个不同复杂度的历史文档数据集（e-NDP、CATMuS、HORAE），评估了两种基于Transformer的模型（Co-DETR、Grounding DINO）和三种YOLO变体（AABB、OBB、YOLO-World）。

Result: 在e-NDP数据集上，Co-DETR表现最佳（0.752 mAP@.50:.95）；而在更复杂的CATMuS和HORAE数据集上，YOLOv11x-OBB显著优于其他模型（0.564和0.568）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用定向边界框（OBB）是准确建模历史文档非笛卡尔特性的关键，Transformer模型适合结构化布局，而CNN-OBB模型在视觉多样性和复杂性高的文档上表现更优。

Abstract: Robust Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is critical for the automated
processing and understanding of historical documents with complex page
organizations. This paper benchmarks five state-of-the-art object detection
architectures on three annotated datasets representing a spectrum of
codicological complexity: The e-NDP, a corpus of Parisian medieval registers
(1326-1504); CATMuS, a diverse multiclass dataset derived from various medieval
and modern sources (ca.12th-17th centuries) and HORAE, a corpus of decorated
books of hours (ca.13th-16th centuries). We evaluate two Transformer-based
models (Co-DETR, Grounding DINO) against three YOLO variants (AABB, OBB, and
YOLO-World). Our findings reveal significant performance variations dependent
on model architecture, data set characteristics, and bounding box
representation. In the e-NDP dataset, Co-DETR achieves state-of-the-art results
(0.752 mAP@.50:.95), closely followed by YOLOv11X-OBB (0.721). Conversely, on
the more complex CATMuS and HORAE datasets, the CNN-based YOLOv11x-OBB
significantly outperforms all other models (0.564 and 0.568, respectively).
This study unequivocally demonstrates that using Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB)
is not a minor refinement but a fundamental requirement for accurately modeling
the non-Cartesian nature of historical manuscripts. We conclude that a key
trade-off exists between the global context awareness of Transformers, ideal
for structured layouts, and the superior generalization of CNN-OBB models for
visually diverse and complex documents.

Motivation: 现有方法如检索增强生成（RAG）和提示工程搜索代理依赖固定流程，导致搜索效率低下或过度。为应对真实场景中复杂动态的信息需求，需要更灵活的搜索框架。

Method: 提出MMSearch-R1框架，整合图文搜索工具，通过基于结果的奖励和搜索惩罚机制指导模型决策搜索时机和方式；构建多模态搜索VQA数据集支持训练。

Abstract: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios
requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic
nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely
on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors.
We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework
that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world
Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search
tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by
an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect
a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers
diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset
with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for
shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on
knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only
outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the
performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over
30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for
advancing research in multimodal search.

Method: 构建BrokenVideos数据集，包含3,254个AI生成视频，带有像素级标注的视觉伪影区域，并通过人工验证确保标注质量。

Result: 实验表明，在BrokenVideos上训练的模型能显著提升伪影定位能力，为生成视频模型的改进提供了重要基准。

Conclusion: BrokenVideos填补了研究空白，为生成视频模型的伪影定位研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have led to significant progress in
video generation, yet the fidelity of AI-generated videos remains limited.
Synthesized content often exhibits visual artifacts such as temporally
inconsistent motion, physically implausible trajectories, unnatural object
deformations, and local blurring that undermine realism and user trust.
Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for
both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved
generative models. However, the research community currently lacks a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI
generated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or
frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary
for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce
BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with
meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual
corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to
ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of
the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)
on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted
regions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos
establishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on
artifact localization in generative video models. The dataset is available at:

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved unified and strong performance
across both visual understanding and image generation tasks. However, removing
undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality
remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive
Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept
erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation
(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and
Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the
target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,
Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more
rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR
models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large
language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of
target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from
these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to
ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted
on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR
achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility
preservation. Code is available at: https://github.com/immc-lab/ear/

Motivation: 为了在资源有限的边缘设备上部署深度神经网络，需要一种高效的剪枝方法来减少计算量，同时保持模型的准确性。现有的剪枝方法通常需要分阶段进行，效率较低。

Method: LAASP采用了一种剪枝与训练相结合的方法，自动选择剪枝标准和层，并通过网络的整体损失来指导剪枝过程。此外，每次剪枝后都会进行短暂的重新训练以减少准确率下降。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，LAASP在ResNet56和ResNet110模型上显著提高了top-1准确率，同时减少了52%的计算量。在ResNet50模型上，计算量减少了42%以上，top-5准确率仅下降0.33%。

Conclusion: LAASP是一种高效的结构化剪枝方法，能够自动选择剪枝标准和层，显著减少计算量，同时保持较高的模型准确性，适用于资源有限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural
networks, making it suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices.
This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured
Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks.
The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of
three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed
pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the
first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The
automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria
from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each
pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of
the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the
network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in
the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual
allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on
the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the
ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the
top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network
FLOPs by 52\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces
FLOPs by more than 42\% with a negligible 0.33\% drop in top-5 accuracy. The

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的渐进对齐退化模块（PADM）和HFreqdiff方法，用于提升深度学习全色锐化的性能，通过自适应学习退化过程和嵌入高频细节，显著提高了图像的空间清晰度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Wald协议在生成监督学习所需的HRMS图像时，假设网络在人工低分辨率数据上的训练效果可以同样适用于高分辨率数据，但实际上这种假设限制了模型的泛化能力。因此，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了PADM模块，通过PAlignNet和PDegradeNet两个子网络的相互迭代，自适应学习准确的退化过程；并引入HFreqdiff方法，结合CFB和BACM模块，嵌入高频细节到扩散框架中，实现频率选择性细节提取和精确的反向过程学习。

Result: 实验和消融研究表明，该方法在空间清晰度和图像质量上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过提出的PADM和HFreqdiff方法，论文成功提升了全色锐化模型的性能，解决了Wald协议在退化模式近似上的不足，为高分辨率多光谱图像的生成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate
high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth
HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly
employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial
low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,
well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between
reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into
the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world
degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To
address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module
(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and
PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying
on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds

Abstract: Understanding human actions in videos requires more than raw pixel analysis;
it relies on high-level semantic reasoning and effective integration of
multimodal features. We propose a deep translational action recognition
framework that enhances recognition accuracy by jointly predicting action
concepts and auxiliary features from RGB video frames. At test time,
hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations
without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions
beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors. Object
Detection Features (ODF) aggregate outputs from multiple object detectors to
capture contextual cues, while Saliency Detection Features (SDF) highlight
spatial and intensity patterns crucial for action recognition. Our framework
seamlessly integrates these descriptors with auxiliary modalities such as
optical flow, Improved Dense Trajectories, skeleton data, and audio cues. It
remains compatible with state-of-the-art architectures, including I3D,
AssembleNet, Video Transformer Network, FASTER, and recent models like VideoMAE
V2 and InternVideo2. To handle uncertainty in auxiliary features, we
incorporate aleatoric uncertainty modeling in the hallucination step and
introduce a robust loss function to mitigate feature noise. Our multimodal
self-supervised action recognition framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, including Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and
Something-Something V2, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
fine-grained action dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合离线图像和在线笔划数据的端到端网络，通过早期融合和共享潜在空间提升手写识别准确率，并在多个数据集上实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数手写识别系统仅利用单一模态（如离线图像或在线笔划数据），而忽略了两种模态之间的互补性。论文旨在通过融合这两种模态的信息，提升识别准确率和书写者独立性。

Method: 论文提出了一种端到端网络，通过早期融合离线图像和在线笔划数据。使用补丁编码器将灰度图像转换为视觉标记，轻量级Transformer嵌入笔划序列，并通过可学习的潜在查询联合处理两种模态，最终在交叉熵损失目标下解码。

Result: 在IAMOn-DB和VNOn-DB数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最优的识别准确率，比之前的最佳结果提高了1%。此外，该方法在ISI-Air数据集上也展示了良好的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过早期融合离线图像和在线笔划数据，该方法显著提升了手写识别的准确率和鲁棒性，证明了多模态融合在表示学习中的有效性。

Abstract: We posit that handwriting recognition benefits from complementary cues
carried by the rasterized complex glyph and the pen's trajectory, yet most
systems exploit only one modality. We introduce an end-to-end network that
performs early fusion of offline images and online stroke data within a shared
latent space. A patch encoder converts the grayscale crop into fixed-length
visual tokens, while a lightweight transformer embeds the $(x, y, \text{pen})$
sequence. Learnable latent queries attend jointly to both token streams,
yielding context-enhanced stroke embeddings that are pooled and decoded under a
cross-entropy loss objective. Because integration occurs before any high-level
classification, temporal cues reinforce each other during representation
learning, producing stronger writer independence. Comprehensive experiments on
IAMOn-DB and VNOn-DB demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy, exceeding previous bests by up to 1\%. Our study also shows
adaptation of this pipeline with gesturification on the ISI-Air dataset. Our
code can be found here.

TL;DR: PLADA是一种新型的深度伪造检测框架，通过处理压缩图像中的块效应和利用配对/非配对数据，显著提升了在开放社交网络中的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测方法忽视了压缩图像中的块效应，且主要针对原始图像，难以应对实际场景中的挑战。

Method: PLADA包含两个核心模块：块效应消除器（B2E）和开放数据聚合（ODA），分别处理块效应和利用多种数据提升检测能力。

Result: 在26个数据集上的实验表明，PLADA在有限配对数据和压缩条件下，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLADA不仅解决了块效应问题，还为开放世界场景提供了鲁棒的深度伪造检测方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly through generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models (DMs), AI-generated images, or
``deepfakes", have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. These images
are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about
their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects"
introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and
primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive
Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and
the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:
Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to
handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both
paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26
datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake
detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with
limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the
``block effect" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust
solution for open-world scenarios. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为艺术品分析开辟了新途径，展示了深度学习在画布相似性评估中的潜力。

Abstract: The study of canvas fabrics in works of art is a crucial tool for
authentication, attribution and conservation. Traditional methods are based on
thread density map matching, which cannot be applied when canvases do not come
from contiguous positions on a roll. This paper presents a novel approach based
on deep learning to assess the similarity of textiles. We introduce an
automatic tool that evaluates the similarity between canvases without relying
on thread density maps. A Siamese deep learning model is designed and trained
to compare pairs of images by exploiting the feature representations learned
from the scans. In addition, a similarity estimation method is proposed,
aggregating predictions from multiple pairs of cloth samples to provide a
robust similarity score. Our approach is applied to canvases from the Museo
Nacional del Prado, corroborating the hypothesis that plain weave canvases,
widely used in painting, can be effectively compared even when their thread
densities are similar. The results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of
the proposed method, opening new avenues for the analysis of masterpieces.

<details>

Motivation: 为了解决未修剪长视频的密集描述问题，作者提出将视频分割为多个事件提议，并利用视觉特征辅助句子摘要，以生成更准确的视频描述。

Method: 首先将视频分割为多个事件提议，每个提议包含多个视频片段；然后提取视觉特征并为每个片段生成句子描述；最后使用两阶段LSTM网络（编码器-解码器结构）结合分层注意力机制，汇总所有句子和视觉特征生成最终描述。

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions数据集上的实验证明了DaS框架的有效性，能够生成准确的密集视频描述。

Conclusion: 提出的DaS框架通过结合视觉特征和句子摘要，显著提升了密集视频描述的性能，为视频内容理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.

these causal representations improve generalisability and robustness across

Result: 在ActivityNet Captions和YouCook II数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: GPaS框架通过分割和总结策略，结合GCN和LSTM，有效提升了密集视频描述的性能。

Abstract: Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization"
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.

Conclusion: 该框架通过联合优化抗失真特征和可训练参考码，实现了无需修改原图的鲁棒零水印，为数字版权保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image
zero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a
zero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and
learns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The
proposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature
extractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations
that are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is
achieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion
discriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the
second module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme
where the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable
reference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive
experiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and
watermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised
and deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our
framework in generalization and robustness.

Conclusion: HiT和DyHiT在速度和精度上取得了显著平衡，动态路由技术为高性能跟踪器提供了有效的加速方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated significant advancements
due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, their practicality is
limited on resource-constrained devices because of their slow processing
speeds. To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient
tracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation
across various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,
which connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing
feature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image
position encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT
achieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson
AGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,
outperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose
DyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by
selecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search
area features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an
efficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the
classification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting
appropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.
The fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while
maintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free
acceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT. This
method significantly improves the execution speed of various high-performance
trackers without sacrificing accuracy. For instance, our acceleration method
enables the state-of-the-art tracker SeqTrack-B256 to achieve a 2.68 times
speedup on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU while maintaining the same AUC of
69.9% on the LaSOT.

Abstract: Microscopy image analysis is fundamental for different applications, from
diagnosis to synthetic engineering and environmental monitoring. Modern
acquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating
amount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of
deep learning-based automatic image analysis methods. Although deep neural

  This work proposes a Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) methodology
to enhance model interpretability for microscopy image classification.
Exploiting benchmark datasets from three different microscopic image domains
(plankton, yeast vacuoles, and human cells), we show how a DRL framework, based
on transferring a representation learnt from synthetic data, can provide a good
trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in this domain.

Conclusion: HiWave无需重新训练或架构修改，即可实现高质量的超高分辨率图像合成，显著提升了视觉保真度和结构一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,
demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training
diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and
existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond
training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and
spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,
zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural
coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion
models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from
the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel
wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion
methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the
base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer
retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural
consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine
details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL
demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in
prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed
HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art
alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for
high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring
retraining or architectural modifications.

Conclusion: 说话人嵌入能有效解决间歇移动场景的身份连续性问题，为跟踪系统提供鲁棒的跨时段身份关联。

Abstract: Speaker tracking methods often rely on spatial observations to assign
coherent track identities over time. This raises limits in scenarios with
intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when
they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This
paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple
solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment
post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related
information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal.
Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in
order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track
identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset
where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it
consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and
standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming
and input duration for embedding extraction.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer trading and the move to decentralized grids have reshaped the
energy markets in the United States. Notwithstanding, such developments lead to
new challenges, mainly regarding the safety and authenticity of energy trade.
This study aimed to develop and build a secure, intelligent, and efficient
energy transaction system for the decentralized US energy market. This research
interlinks the technological prowess of blockchain and artificial intelligence
(AI) in a novel way to solve long-standing challenges in the distributed energy
market, specifically those of security, fraudulent behavior detection, and
market reliability. The dataset for this research is comprised of more than 1.2
million anonymized energy transaction records from a simulated peer-to-peer
(P2P) energy exchange network emulating real-life blockchain-based American
microgrids, including those tested by LO3 Energy and Grid+ Labs. Each record
contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume

(hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement
confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior

Abstract: Insurance fraud detection represents a pivotal advancement in modern
insurance service, providing intelligent and digitalized monitoring to enhance
management and prevent fraud. It is crucial for ensuring the security and
efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms
have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the
absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable
to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach
to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate
that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model
details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a
99\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and
claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially
bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent
need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against
adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of
different insurance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全权重发布方案缺乏严格的安全理论基础，仅提供非正式的安全保证。论文旨在通过形式化安全定义，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 论文引入了多个具体的安全定义，并以TaylorMLP为例进行案例分析，揭示其潜在漏洞。

Result: 分析表明，TaylorMLP存在参数提取漏洞，无法实现其非正式的安全目标。

Conclusion: 论文为未来权重发布方案的设计和评估提供了蓝图，并倡导在机器学习和安全交叉领域进行更严谨的研究。

Abstract: Recent secure weight release schemes claim to enable open-source model
distribution while protecting model ownership and preventing misuse. However,
these approaches lack rigorous security foundations and provide only informal
security guarantees. Inspired by established works in cryptography, we
formalize the security of weight release schemes by introducing several
concrete security definitions. We then demonstrate our definition's utility
through a case study of TaylorMLP, a prominent secure weight release scheme.
Our analysis reveals vulnerabilities that allow parameter extraction thus
showing that TaylorMLP fails to achieve its informal security goals. We hope
this work will advocate for rigorous research at the intersection of machine
learning and security communities and provide a blueprint for how future weight
release schemes should be designed and evaluated.

Motivation: 寻找适合入侵检测的机器学习模型，以构建有效且通用的安全解决方案。

Method: 在CICIDS2017数据集上对比了MLP、1D CNN、OCSVM和LOF四种模型，分别测试已知攻击和未知攻击的检测效果。

Result: 监督学习的MLP和CNN在已知攻击上表现优异，但在未知攻击上召回率骤降；无监督的LOF对未知攻击召回率高但误报率高；OCSVM在精度和召回率之间平衡最好。

Conclusion: OCSVM在动态网络环境中表现出最稳健的检测能力，为入侵检测模型选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Identifying suitable machine learning paradigms for intrusion detection
remains critical for building effective and generalizable security solutions.
In this study, we present a controlled comparison of four representative models
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) - on
the CICIDS2017 dataset under two scenarios: detecting known attack types and
generalizing to previously unseen threats. Our results show that supervised MLP
and CNN achieve near-perfect accuracy on familiar attacks but suffer drastic
recall drops on novel attacks. Unsupervised LOF attains moderate overall
accuracy and high recall on unknown threats at the cost of elevated false
alarms, while boundary-based OCSVM balances precision and recall best,
demonstrating robust detection across both scenarios. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting IDS models in dynamic network environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索混淆生成(RCG)的新防御范式，可高效隐蔽地防御LLM隐私侵犯攻击(PVA)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在推理成本高、效果不佳或暴露防御机制的问题，亟需更高效的隐蔽防御方案。

Method: 通过改写提示构建扰动数据库，采用最不相关检索策略替换数据评论，生成含错误属性的响应。

Result: 在2个数据集和8个主流LLM上的实验验证了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: RCG范式成功实现了对PVA攻击的高效隐蔽防御，为LLM隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made a profound impact
on our society and also raised new security concerns. Particularly, due to the
remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA),
revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing
defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which
requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense
performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective
defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of
PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on
retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly
defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to
rewrite the "user comments" of the attack query to construct a disturbed
database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve
the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the "data comments"
are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to
responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the
attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight
popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of
the proposed defense method.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出RepuNet，一种去中心化联邦学习中的信誉系统，通过动态评估节点行为来检测和缓解恶意攻击，实验表明其在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中节点自主选择聚合对等节点，易受模型投毒、延迟攻击和消息洪泛等恶意行为影响。现有解决方案依赖固定配置或额外基础设施，存在计算开销、可扩展性差或适应性不足的问题。

Method: 提出RepuNet信誉系统，通过模型相似度、参数变化、消息延迟和通信量等指标动态评估节点行为，并基于信誉分数调整节点在模型聚合中的影响力。集成至Nebula DFL平台，在非独立同分布数据（MNIST/CIFAR-10）和不同拓扑结构下进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示RepuNet能有效检测和缓解恶意行为：在MNIST场景下F1分数超过95%，CIFAR-10场景下约76%。系统展现出良好的适应性、鲁棒性和实用潜力。

Conclusion: RepuNet通过动态信誉机制解决了DFL中的安全威胁，其去中心化设计避免了额外基础设施依赖，为实际部署提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables nodes to collaboratively train
models without a central server, introducing new vulnerabilities since each
node independently selects peers for model aggregation. Malicious nodes may
exploit this autonomy by sending corrupted models (model poisoning), delaying
model submissions (delay attack), or flooding the network with excessive
messages, negatively affecting system performance. Existing solutions often
depend on rigid configurations or additional infrastructures such as
blockchain, leading to computational overhead, scalability issues, or limited
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a
decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically
evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes,
message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model
aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was
integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to
25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack
intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results
demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior,
achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for
CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness,
and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated
learning environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成模型输出是否可能侵犯训练数据版权，并寻求可证明的版权保护方法。

Method: 提出无责复制保护框架，并引入清洁室复制保护概念，同时分析差分隐私与版权的关系。

Result: 证明近访问自由性（NAF）不足以防止侵权，差分隐私在数据集满足去重要求时可实现清洁室复制保护。

Conclusion: 论文建立了更坚实的技术和法律基础，为生成模型的版权保护提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are
guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the
question of "provable copyright protection" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and
Barak (ICML 2023). They define near access-freeness (NAF) and propose it as
sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new
foundations for provable copyright protection -- foundations that are firmer
both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent
infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant
failure of copy protection that we dub being tainted. Then, we introduce our
blameless copy protection framework for defining meaningful guarantees, and
instantiate it with clean-room copy protection. Clean-room copy protection
allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is
unlikely to copy in a counterfactual clean-room setting. Finally, we formalize
a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP
implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is golden, a copyright
deduplication requirement.

Motivation: 面向任务的语义通信在6G网络中具有潜力，但存在隐私泄露和传统图像质量评估指标不适用的问题。

Method: 提出DiffSem框架，利用扩散机制和自引用标签嵌入优化语义重建，并采用语义信息失真增强系统鲁棒性。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，DiffSem将分类准确率提高10.03%，且在动态信道中表现稳定。

Conclusion: DiffSem有效提升任务性能，同时传统图像质量指标与语义信息泄露之间存在显著偏差。

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system
design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel
paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by
transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task
performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining
task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In
such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by
analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based
nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality
indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be
inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences
do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a
diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes
semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with
self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our
model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion
to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio
environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric
that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.
Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,
DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable
performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that
significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and
the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.

Conclusion: Guardian-FC为隐私保护的联邦计算提供了一个统一的框架，并提出了未来的研究方向，包括自适应防护栏调优、多后端组合和DSL规范开发。

Abstract: We propose Guardian-FC, a novel two-layer framework for privacy preserving
federated computing that unifies safety enforcement across diverse privacy
preserving mechanisms, including cryptographic back-ends like fully homomorphic
encryption (FHE) and multiparty computation (MPC), as well as statistical
techniques such as differential privacy (DP). Guardian-FC decouples guard-rails
from privacy mechanisms by executing plug-ins (modular computation units),
written in a backend-neutral, domain-specific language (DSL) designed
specifically for federated computing workflows and interchangeable Execution
Providers (EPs), which implement DSL operations for various privacy back-ends.
An Agentic-AI control plane enforces a finite-state safety loop through signed
telemetry and commands, ensuring consistent risk management and auditability.
The manifest-centric design supports fail-fast job admission and seamless
extensibility to new privacy back-ends. We present qualitative scenarios
illustrating backend-agnostic safety and a formal model foundation for
verification. Finally, we outline a research agenda inviting the community to
advance adaptive guard-rail tuning, multi-backend composition, DSL
specification development, implementation, and compiler extensibility alongside
human-override usability.

Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ADWPF的注意力驱动细粒度网页指纹攻击方法，通过注意力机制增强流量特征提取，解决了多标签浏览和子页面识别难题，并在不同规模数据集上超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网站指纹攻击（WF）主要局限于识别主页，难以应对实际场景中用户快速访问多个子页面及多标签浏览的复杂情况，导致分类困难。

Method: ADWPF在训练阶段基于注意力图对流量关键区域进行针对性增强（如注意力裁剪和掩码），提取低维特征后通过自注意力模块捕捉全局上下文模式，并利用残差注意力处理多标签场景下的时序位置差异。

Result: 实验表明，ADWPF在不同规模数据集上均显著优于现有基线方法，验证了其对子页面和多标签浏览场景的有效性。

Conclusion: ADWPF通过注意力机制实现了细粒度网页指纹识别，为大规模实际环境中的用户隐私保护研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is
visiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity.
Although this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled
experimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios,
typically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings,
however, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often
before previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes
the WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same
site as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,
resulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we
consider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses
multiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,
and similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,
thereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these
challenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named
ADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation
to salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention
cropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features
from both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules
to capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the
multi-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific
representations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.

Motivation: IT与OT的融合使关键基础设施暴露于新型自适应攻击下，传统静态防御失效。现有安全范式未能解决'信任三元组'（系统模型保真度、数据同步完整性、分析引擎抗规避性）问题。

Method: 提出ARC框架：1) 用深度强化学习训练'红方'自主发现隐蔽攻击路径；2) 通过对抗训练持续强化基于集成的'蓝方'防御；3) 在F-SCDT沙箱中建立持续对抗演化的闭环机制。

Result: 在TEP和SWaT测试平台上验证：1) 对抗演化过程显著提升新攻击检测率（ROC曲线/SHAP图佐证）；2) 结合XAI确保操作员信任；3) 可扩展的F-ARC架构实现动态自进化安全。

Conclusion: ARC框架代表关键基础设施安全范式的根本转变——从静态防御转向动态自主演进的安全体系，为未来基础设施防护提供必要解决方案。

Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing
critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries
that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to
address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the
system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the
analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC
framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,
closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms
race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red
Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,
physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while
evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is
continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats
discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to
become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously
probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the
TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A
comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including
ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is
responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.
By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC
architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a
necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future
of critical infrastructure.

Motivation: 当前对抗攻击理论在实际应用中存在差距，特别是在结构化数据如网络流量中，现有防御方法难以应对不断演变的攻击。

Result: 实验证明该方法能以最小交互有效规避检测，提升实际场景中的适应性和应用性。

Conclusion: 本研究推进了对网络流量中对抗攻击的理解，为开发鲁棒防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks, wherein slight inputs are carefully crafted to mislead
intelligent models, have attracted increasing attention. However, a critical
gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application,
particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent
features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in
current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field.
Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that
addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system
access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box
constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect
real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using
change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive
features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational
cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's
effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its
adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the
understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a
foundation for developing robust defenses.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems
described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based
on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static
state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional
incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking
of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation
uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS,
we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a
tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional
incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the
formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive
feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results
are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process
benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于格量化的联邦学习方法通常采用固定量化规则，在异构和动态环境中表现不佳。

Method: 提出OLALa框架，允许客户端通过轻量级本地计算在线调整量化器，并设计了在线学习算法。

Result: 实验表明OLALa在不同量化率下均能提升学习性能，优于传统固定码本和非自适应方案。

Conclusion: OLALa通过动态调整量化器有效优化了联邦学习的通信效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across distributed
clients without sharing raw data, often at the cost of substantial
communication overhead induced by transmitting high-dimensional model updates.
This overhead can be alleviated by having the clients quantize their model
updates, with dithered lattice quantizers identified as an attractive scheme
due to its structural simplicity and convergence-preserving properties.
However, existing lattice-based FL schemes typically rely on a fixed
quantization rule, which is suboptimal in heterogeneous and dynamic
environments where the model updates distribution varies across users and
training rounds. In this work, we propose Online Learned Adaptive Lattices
(OLALa), a heterogeneous FL framework where each client can adjust its
quantizer online using lightweight local computations. We first derive
convergence guarantees for FL with non-fixed lattice quantizers and show that
proper lattice adaptation can tighten the convergence bound. Then, we design an
online learning algorithm that enables clients to tune their quantizers
throughout the FL process while exchanging only a compact set of quantization
parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that OLALa consistently improves
learning performance under various quantization rates, outperforming

### [196] [Quantum Neural Networks for Propensity Score Estimation and Survival Analysis in Observational Biomedical Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19973)
*Vojtěch Novák,Ivan Zelinka,Lenka Přibylová,Lubomír Martínek*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了量子神经网络（QNN）在倾向评分估计中的应用，以解决比较腹腔镜与开放手术技术生存结果时的选择偏差问题。在1177名结直肠癌患者的数据集上，QNN模型在噪声环境下表现优于传统方法，并通过倾向评分匹配和加权实现了协变量平衡。生存分析显示调整后无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用量子神经网络（QNN）改进倾向评分估计，以解决在比较腹腔镜与开放手术技术生存结果时的选择偏差问题，特别是在小样本高维数据集中提升因果推断的准确性。

Method: 研究使用包含77个变量的数据集，开发了基于QNN的倾向评分模型，采用线性ZFeatureMap编码数据、SummedPaulis算子进行预测，并通过CMA-ES进行优化。同时整合方差正则化以减少量子测量噪声，并在不同噪声条件下进行模拟。

Result: QNN模型在模拟硬件噪声条件下表现优于经典逻辑回归和梯度提升机（AUC达0.750）。倾向评分匹配和加权实现了协变量平衡（标准化均数差分别为0.0849和0.0869）。生存分析显示调整后无显著生存差异（p值0.287-0.851）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，QNN结合CMA-优化和噪声感知策略，能够有效提升生物医学研究中的因果推断能力，尤其适用于小样本高维数据集。调整后的分析揭示了未调整结果中的混杂偏差。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of quantum neural networks (QNNs) for
propensity score estimation to address selection bias in comparing survival
outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgical techniques in a cohort of 1177
colorectal carcinoma patients treated at University Hospital Ostrava
(2001-2009). Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics
and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models
focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture
employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for
predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance
regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with
simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware
(FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,
outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in
small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing
predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via
genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with
standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival
analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen
additive regression revealed no significant survival differences
post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in
unadjusted outcomes. These results highlight QNNs' potential, enhanced by
CMA-ES and noise-aware strategies, to improve causal inference in biomedical
research, particularly for small-sample, high-dimensional datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可解释的表面视觉Transformer（X-SiT），用于基于可解释的皮层特征进行医学图像分析，特别是在阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆的检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D体积数据在可视化和解释复杂结构（如大脑皮层）方面存在挑战，而皮层表面渲染提供了更易理解的3D表示。因此，开发一种可解释的神经网络以支持临床决策成为必要。

Method: 提出了eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer（X-SiT），这是一种基于可解释皮层特征的可解释神经网络，并引入了一种原型表面补丁解码器，用于分类表面补丁嵌入，结合了基于案例的推理和空间对应的皮层原型。

Result: X-SiT在检测阿尔茨海默病和额颞叶痴呆方面表现出最先进的性能，同时提供了与已知疾病模式一致的信息原型，并揭示了分类错误。

Conclusion: X-SiT不仅提高了医学图像分析的性能，还通过可解释的特征增强了临床决策的支持，为神经系统疾病的研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Interpretable models are crucial for supporting clinical decision-making,
driving advances in their development and application for medical images.
However, the nature of 3D volumetric data makes it inherently challenging to
visualize and interpret intricate and complex structures like the cerebral
cortex. Cortical surface renderings, on the other hand, provide a more
accessible and understandable 3D representation of brain anatomy, facilitating
visualization and interactive exploration. Motivated by this advantage and the
widespread use of surface data for studying neurological disorders, we present
the eXplainable Surface Vision Transformer (X-SiT). This is the first
inherently interpretable neural network that offers human-understandable
predictions based on interpretable cortical features. As part of X-SiT, we
introduce a prototypical surface patch decoder for classifying surface patch
embeddings, incorporating case-based reasoning with spatially corresponding
cortical prototypes. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
detecting Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia while additionally
providing informative prototypes that align with known disease patterns and
reveal classification errors.

### [198] [DeepQuark: deep-neural-network approach to multiquark bound states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555)
*Wei-Lin Wu,Lu Meng,Shi-Lin Zhu*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 本文首次将基于深度神经网络的变分蒙特卡洛方法应用于多夸克束缚态研究，提出高效架构DeepQuark，在多夸克系统中表现出色，尤其在五夸克领域超越现有计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多夸克束缚态的研究因强SU(3)色相互作用而比电子或核子系统更为复杂，传统方法面临计算障碍。本文旨在克服这些挑战，探索非微扰QCD和一般多体物理。

Method: 设计了一种新颖高效的架构DeepQuark，解决了多夸克系统中的强相关性、额外离散量子数和难处理的约束相互作用等独特挑战。

Result: 在核子、双重重四夸克和全重重四夸克系统中，该方法与扩散蒙特卡洛和高斯展开法等先进方法竞争。在五夸克领域，如三重重五夸克，表现优于现有计算。

Conclusion: DeepQuark有望扩展到更大的多夸克系统，克服传统方法的计算障碍，并为探索多夸克态中超越二体相互作用的约束机制提供强大框架。

Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational
Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity
surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color
interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to
address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger
correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement
interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with
state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian
expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy
tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for
pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we
successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without
additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe
hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased
form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound
$\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its
bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the
molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in
the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for
extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers
in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring
confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which
may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body
physics.

Conclusion: 研讨会验证了AI通过快速迭代和跨学科综合加速核能研究的潜力，同时强调了需要定制核能专用数据集、工作流自动化和专业化模型开发。这些结果为将AI工具整合到核科学工作流中提供了路线图，同时保持严格的科学标准。

Abstract: The AI for Nuclear Energy workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory evaluated
the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate fusion and fission
research. Fourteen interdisciplinary teams explored diverse nuclear science
challenges using ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI models over a single
day. Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor
control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation,
and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed
structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities,
and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research
strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage
exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully
identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks.
However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel
materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and
domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes
resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a
complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The
workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through
rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need
for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized
model development. These results provide a roadmap for integrating AI tools
into nuclear science workflows, potentially reducing development cycles for
safer, more efficient nuclear energy systems while maintaining rigorous
scientific standards.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单边分组、预定义团队或固定群体设置，而动态群体中算法双向分组选择的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入了一个动态多智能体系统中学习双向团队形成的框架，分析双边团队形成中影响策略性能和泛化的算法特性。

Result: 在广泛采用的多智能体场景中验证了该方法，展示了在大多数场景中的竞争性能和改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态多智能体系统中的双向团队形成提供了新的见解，并验证了其在实际场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant
interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However,
existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or
fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral
grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic
multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic
properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and
generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent
scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in
most scenarios.

Conclusion: FundaQ-8框架显著提升眼底图像质量评估的客观性，质量感知训练对实际筛查应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: Automated fundus image quality assessment (FIQA) remains a challenge due to
variations in image acquisition and subjective expert evaluations. We introduce
FundaQ-8, a novel expert-validated framework for systematically assessing
fundus image quality using eight critical parameters, including field coverage,
anatomical visibility, illumination, and image artifacts. Using FundaQ-8 as a
structured scoring reference, we develop a ResNet18-based regression model to
predict continuous quality scores in the 0 to 1 range. The model is trained on
1800 fundus images from real-world clinical sources and Kaggle datasets, using
transfer learning, mean squared error optimization, and standardized
preprocessing. Validation against the EyeQ dataset and statistical analyses
confirm the framework's reliability and clinical interpretability.
Incorporating FundaQ-8 into deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy

TL;DR: VoxelOpt提出了一种结合学习与迭代方法优势的离散优化框架，用于可变形图像配准，在精度与速度间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法在训练数据有限、大形变或无标签监督时表现不佳，而迭代方法虽准确但速度慢。VoxelOpt旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: 通过位移熵衡量体素位移信号强度，引入体素自适应消息传递、多级图像金字塔及预训练分割模型提取特征。

Result: 在腹部CT配准中，VoxelOpt在效率和精度上超越主流迭代方法，并媲美有监督学习的先进方法。

Conclusion: VoxelOpt通过离散优化框架有效结合两类方法优势，为图像配准提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image
registration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and
accurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges
with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform
compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While
iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are
considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,
we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines
the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better
balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement
entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each
voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it
introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy
receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level
image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential
complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive
learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature
extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to
outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching
state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision. The
source code will be available at https://github.com/tinymilky/VoxelOpt

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为加权平均频率（WMF）的新手工特征，用于改善4D Flow MRI图像的分割效果，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI图像在量化血流速度场方面具有潜力，但分辨率低和噪声问题影响了如壁剪切应力等生物标志物的准确性。PC-MRA是目前最先进的分割辅助方法，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入了一种新的手工特征——加权平均频率（WMF），该特征能够三维显示被脉动血流经过的体素区域，从而辅助分割任务。通过最优阈值化和深度学习方法进行了分割实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，与PC-MRA特征相比，WMF特征在IoU和Dice指标上分别提高了0.12和0.13，显著提升了分割性能。

Conclusion: WMF特征在4D Flow MRI图像分割中表现出优越性，未来可能为心脏或大脑等其他血管区域的分割提供有价值的见解。

Abstract: In recent decades, the use of 4D Flow MRI images has enabled the
quantification of velocity fields within a volume of interest and along the
cardiac cycle. However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in
these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it
appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by
the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate
segmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft
feature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is
useful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies
(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has
been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the
hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under
discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved
segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning
methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of
IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with
the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task. This feature has
the potential to yield valuable insights that could inform future segmentation
processes in other vascular regions, such as the heart or the brain.

Abstract: This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion
framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the
hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages
the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the
flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By
integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorch's automatic differentiation
mechanism, the framework enables accurate and efficient inversion of both
dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Experimental evaluations
on synthetic data and real wavefield data demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves dual-parameter FWI for GPR data while maintaining high accuracy.
Moreover, the framework is flexible and extensible, supporting optional
regularization strategies such as total variation and multi-scale inversion.
These features make the proposed approach a practical and scalable framework
for rapid GPR-based subsurface imaging in applications including civil
engineering, environmental monitoring, and geophysical exploration.

Abstract: Cloud computing drives innovation but also poses significant environmental
challenges due to its high-energy consumption and carbon emissions. Data
centers account for 2-4% of global energy usage, and the ICT sector's share of
electricity consumption is projected to reach 40% by 2040. As the goal of
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 becomes increasingly urgent, there is a
growing need for more efficient and transparent solutions, particularly for
private cloud infrastructures, which are utilized by 87% of organizations,
despite the dominance of public-cloud systems.
  This study evaluates the MAIZX framework, designed to optimize cloud
operations and reduce carbon footprint by dynamically ranking resources,
including data centers, edge computing nodes, and multi-cloud environments,
based on real-time and forecasted carbon intensity, Power Usage Effectiveness
(PUE), and energy consumption. Leveraging a flexible ranking algorithm, MAIZX
achieved an 85.68% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to baseline hypervisor
operations. Tested across geographically distributed data centers, the
framework demonstrates scalability and effectiveness, directly interfacing with
hypervisors to optimize workloads in private, hybrid, and multi-cloud
environments. MAIZX integrates real-time data on carbon intensity, power
consumption, and carbon footprint, as well as forecasted values, into cloud
management, providing a robust tool for enhancing climate performance potential
while maintaining operational efficiency.

integrating with existing AI frameworks, WattsOnAI offers standardized reports
and exports fine-grained time-series data to support benchmarking and
reproducibility in a lightweight manner. It further enables in-depth
correlation analysis between hardware metrics and model performance and thus
facilitates bottleneck identification and performance enhancement. By

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) that respect E(3) symmetries have
achieved strong performance on small molecule modeling, but they face
scalability and expressiveness challenges when applied to large biomolecules
such as RNA and proteins. These systems require models that can simultaneously
capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across
spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure,
such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains.
Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either
Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture
both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware
dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large
biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant
Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and
Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware
features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a
novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate
atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling
efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.
DualEquiNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing
benchmarks for RNA property prediction and protein modeling, and outperforms
prior methods on two newly introduced 3D structural benchmarks demonstrating
its broad effectiveness across a range of large biomolecule modeling tasks.

Abstract: Template-based molecular generation offers a promising avenue for drug design
by ensuring generated compounds are synthetically accessible through predefined
reaction templates and building blocks. In this work, we tackle three core
challenges in template-based GFlowNets: (1) minimizing synthesis cost, (2)
scaling to large building block libraries, and (3) effectively utilizing small
fragment sets. We propose \textbf{Recursive Cost Guidance}, a backward policy
framework that employs auxiliary machine learning models to approximate
synthesis cost and viability. This guidance steers generation toward low-cost
synthesis pathways, significantly enhancing cost-efficiency, molecular
diversity, and quality, especially when paired with an \textbf{Exploitation
Penalty} that balances the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To
enhance performance in smaller building block libraries, we develop a
\textbf{Dynamic Library} mechanism that reuses intermediate high-reward states
to construct full synthesis trees. Our approach establishes state-of-the-art
results in template-based molecular generation.

*Mototaka Suzuki,Jaan Aru*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Recent advances in neuroscience shed light on how cortical pyramidal neurons, dubbed 'psychic cells' by Ramón y Cajal, may underlie consciousness through specific cellular mechanisms involving metabotropic receptors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the brain, building on historical insights and recent technological advancements.

Method: The study reviews recent progress in neuroscience, focusing on the role of cortical pyramidal neurons and their metabotropic receptors in conscious processing.

Result: Findings suggest that a specific class of metabotropic receptors on pyramidal cell dendrites plays a key role in consciousness, particularly in how anesthesia disrupts feedback signaling.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Ramón y Cajal's early intuition about 'psychic cells' may be correct, as current research begins to uncover how these neurons could generate and control consciousness.

Abstract: Technological advances in the past decades have begun to enable
neuroscientists to address fundamental questions about consciousness in an
unprecedented way. Here we review remarkable recent progress in our
understanding of cellular-level mechanisms of conscious processing in the
brain. Of particular interest are the cortical pyramidal neurons -- or "psychic
cells" called by Ram\'on y Cajal more than 100 years ago -- which have an
intriguing cellular mechanism that accounts for selective disruption of
feedback signaling in the brain upon anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness.
Importantly, a particular class of metabotropic receptors distributed over the
dendrites of pyramidal cells are highlighted as the key cellular mechanism.
After all, Cajal's instinct over a century ago may turn out to be correct -- we
may have just begun to understand whether and how psychic cells indeed generate
and control our consciousness.

Method: 研究利用手机等普及设备录制的枪声，通过分析枪口爆炸和冲击波等声学特征，采用支持向量机（SVM）和卷积神经网络（CNN）进行枪声检测和枪支分类。

Result: 深度学习方法的平均精度（mAP）达到0.58，优于SVM基线（0.39）。但在网络来源的噪声数据上表现下降（mAP 0.35）。

Abstract: The escalating rates of gun-related violence and mass shootings represent a
significant threat to public safety. Timely and accurate information for law
enforcement agencies is crucial in mitigating these incidents. Current
commercial gunshot detection systems, while effective, often come with
prohibitive costs. This research explores a cost-effective alternative by
leveraging acoustic analysis of gunshot recordings, potentially obtainable from
ubiquitous devices like cell phones, to not only detect gunshots but also
classify the type of firearm used. This paper details a study on deciphering
gun type hierarchies using a curated dataset of 3459 recordings. We investigate
the fundamental acoustic characteristics of gunshots, including muzzle blasts
and shockwaves, which vary based on firearm type, ammunition, and shooting
direction. We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type
classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a
mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the
SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental
noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data
(mAP 0.35) are also discussed. The long-term vision is to develop a highly
accurate, real-time system deployable on common recording devices,
significantly reducing detection costs and providing critical intelligence to
first responders.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的信道占用预测方法MiLAAP，通过自注意力机制预测干扰区域内的信道状态，无需节点间状态共享，显著提高了动态网络中的信道状态预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线网络中，信道跳变通信系统需要适应干扰变化和节点移动以维持吞吐效率。传统的状态共享方法会引入大量通信开销，尤其在网络规模扩大或节点移动性增强时，这会进一步降低容量受限网络的吞吐效率。

Method: 论文提出了MiLAAP框架，利用基于自注意力的机器学习模型，通过局部被动观测的信道活动数据，预测干扰区域内的信道占用状态。此外，采用多头自注意力机制捕捉节点间的时空依赖性，预测移动节点的轨迹，从而进一步提高预测准确性。

Result: 实验表明，MiLAAP在不同节点移动模式下，信道状态预测准确率接近100%，并且能够实现跨不同信道跳变序列的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MiLAAP通过局部观测和自注意力机制，有效解决了信道状态预测中的通信开销问题，显著提升了动态网络中的预测准确率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes
in the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput
efficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information
(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in
interference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant
communication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,
thereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.
In this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on
a learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP
attention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,
spatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a
self-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS
pattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel
occupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on
locally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no
communication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a
multi-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it
and accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes
that enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve
the prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks
that use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the
channel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across
different node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability
across different periods of CS sequences.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段、物理引导的深度学习流程，用于自动化放射治疗计划，通过结合MLC和MU值的直接监督以及预测3D剂量分布的额外监督信号，显著提高了治疗计划的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射治疗（RT）是癌症治疗的重要手段，而自适应放疗需要频繁调整治疗计划以适应解剖结构变化。传统方法耗时且复杂，因此需要一种高效自动化的解决方案。深度学习为此提供了可能。

Method: 论文提出了一种两阶段的深度学习流程：第一阶段网络通过直接监督学习治疗计划参数（MLC和MU值）；第二阶段引入预测3D剂量分布的额外监督信号，将物理引导整合到训练过程中。使用了3D U-Net和UNETR架构。

Result: 在133名前列腺癌患者的数据集上，该方法生成的计划与临床真实值高度吻合，PTV的D95%和V95%差异分别为0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy和-0.22 +/- 1.87%，同时降低了危险器官的辐射暴露。

Conclusion: 研究表明，物理引导的深度学习在放射治疗计划中具有巨大潜力，能够高效生成高质量的治疗计划，同时减少对危险器官的辐射。

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) is a critical cancer treatment, with volumetric modulated
arc therapy (VMAT) being a commonly used technique that enhances dose
conformity by dynamically adjusting multileaf collimator (MLC) positions and
monitor units (MU) throughout gantry rotation. Adaptive radiotherapy requires
frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations,
necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising
solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage,
physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first
stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan
parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we
incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose
distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We
train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a
uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target
volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented
using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment
plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean
difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV
while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at
risk. These findings highlight the potential of physics-guided deep learning in
RT planning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于神经网络的模型，用于预测皮肤与粘合剂剥离时的最小剥离力，显著降低了计算成本并保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究皮肤与粘合剂的剥离行为对医疗粘合剂和透皮贴剂等生物医学应用至关重要。传统方法如实验测试和有限元分析（FEM）虽然被视为金标准，但资源密集、计算成本高且耗时，特别是在分析广泛的材料参数空间时。

Abstract: Studying the peeling behaviour of adhesives on skin is vital for advancing
biomedical applications such as medical adhesives and transdermal patches.
Traditional methods like experimental testing and finite element method (FEM),
though considered gold standards, are resource-intensive, computationally
expensive and time-consuming, particularly when analysing a wide material
parameter space. In this study, we present a neural network-based approach to
predict the minimum peel force (F_min) required for adhesive detachment from
skin tissue, limiting the need for repeated FEM simulations and significantly
reducing the computational cost. Leveraging a dataset generated from FEM
simulations of 90 degree peel test with varying adhesive and fracture mechanics
parameters, our neural network model achieved high accuracy, validated through
rigorous 5-fold cross-validation. The final architecture was able to predict a
wide variety of skin-adhesive peeling behaviour, exhibiting a mean squared
error (MSE) of 3.66*10^-7 and a R^2 score of 0.94 on test set, demonstrating
robust performance. This work introduces a reliable, computationally efficient
method for predicting adhesive behaviour, significantly reducing simulation
time while maintaining accuracy. This integration of machine learning with
high-fidelity biomechanical simulations enables efficient design and
optimization of skin-adhesive systems, providing a scalable framework for
future research in computational dermato-mechanics and bio-adhesive material
design.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PSALM-V是首个能在视觉环境中通过交互自主推断符号动作语义（前置与后置条件）的神经符号学习系统，无需专家定义即可实现可靠符号规划，显著提升部分可观测环境下的规划成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型生成PDDL动作语义的方法局限于文本领域或依赖不现实的假设（如预定义问题文件、完全可观测性）。PSALM-V旨在突破这些限制，实现视觉环境下的自主符号推理。

Method: 系统通过LLM生成启发式规划和候选符号语义，动态推断PDDL问题文件，分析执行结果并合成错误解释，以树状信念结构迭代优化动作语义直至达成目标。

Result: 在ALFRED任务中规划成功率从37%提升至74%；在RTFM和Overcooked-AI中提升步骤效率并实现多智能体领域归纳；成功推导出真实机器人BlocksWorld任务的PDDL条件。

Conclusion: PSALM-V证明了神经符号方法在复杂视觉环境中自主获取符号语义的可行性，为具身AI的规划能力提供了新范式。

Abstract: We propose PSALM-V, the first autonomous neuro-symbolic learning system able
to induce symbolic action semantics (i.e., pre- and post-conditions) in visual
environments through interaction. PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning
without expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and
candidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language
models to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily
focused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as
access to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error
messages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain
action semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible
error explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while
maintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each
action, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.
Simulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V
increases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially
observed setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,
show that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in
multi-agent settings. PSALM-V correctly induces PDDL pre- and post-conditions
for real-world robot BlocksWorld tasks, despite low-level manipulation failures
from the robot.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了机器学习模型在检测人机对话中沟通错误的效果，发现即使使用最先进的计算机视觉模型，识别沟通错误的性能也仅略高于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测人机交互中的沟通错误对于维持用户参与和信任至关重要。尽管人类能轻松通过语言和非语言线索识别沟通错误，但机器人在解释非语言反馈方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 研究使用了包含240段人机对话的多模态数据集，系统性地引入了四种对话失败类型，并评估了最先进的计算机视觉模型在检测这些错误中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，即使使用最先进的模型，识别沟通错误的性能仅略高于随机猜测。在情感表达更丰富的数据集上，模型能成功识别困惑状态，但人类评分者也仅能识别约一半的沟通错误。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了识别机器人对话中沟通错误的根本局限性：即使用户感知到沟通错误，也往往不会向机器人传达这一信息。这一发现有助于设定对计算机视觉模型性能的合理预期，并指导设计更好的人机对话系统。

Abstract: Detecting miscommunication in human-robot interaction is a critical function
for maintaining user engagement and trust. While humans effortlessly detect
communication errors in conversations through both verbal and non-verbal cues,
robots face significant challenges in interpreting non-verbal feedback, despite
advances in computer vision for recognizing affective expressions. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting
miscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240
human-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures
were systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art
computer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback
on whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability
to accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the
performance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while
on a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully
identified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human
raters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced
miscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental
limitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users
perceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate
this to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape
expectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help
researchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately
eliciting feedback where needed.

Conclusion: 分层强化学习框架显著提升了四足机器人的地形适应能力，无需额外训练即可泛化至更复杂环境。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
quadruped locomotion over challenging terrain. Our approach incorporates a
two-layer hierarchy in which a high-level policy (HLP) selects optimal goals
for a low-level policy (LLP). The LLP is trained using an on-policy
actor-critic RL algorithm and is given footstep placements as goals. We propose
an HLP that does not require any additional training or environment samples and
instead operates via an online optimization process over the learned value
function of the LLP. We demonstrate the benefits of this framework by comparing
it with an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We observe
improvements in its ability to achieve higher rewards with fewer collisions
across an array of different terrains, including terrains more difficult than
any encountered during training.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing robotic exploration by using
generative occupancy mapping. We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model
designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial
observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions
into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant
improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard
a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that
occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully
observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59%
improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating
SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a "drop-in" map
improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in
improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of
full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar
environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent
exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network approach for generating and customizing the
trajectory of a robotic arm, that guarantees precision and repeatability. To
highlight the potential of this novel method, we describe the design and
implementation of the technique and show its application in an experimental
setting of cognitive robotics. In this scenario, the NICO robot was
characterized by the ability to point to specific points in space with precise
linear movements, increasing the predictability of the robotic action during
its interaction with humans. To achieve this goal, the neural network computes
the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial
dataset created from suitable start and end poses of the robotic arm. Through
the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in
terms of shape and accuracy. Thanks to its broad applicability, our approach
successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their
shape and adapted to different settings.

Conclusion: CARMA系统在人机协作环境中，通过结构化三元组提供强大的情境感知基础，支持复杂的时空推理和决策。

Abstract: We introduce CARMA, a system for situational grounding in human-robot group
interactions. Effective collaboration in such group settings requires
situational awareness based on a consistent representation of present persons
and objects coupled with an episodic abstraction of events regarding actors and
manipulated objects. This calls for a clear and consistent assignment of
instances, ensuring that robots correctly recognize and track actors, objects,
and their interactions over time. To achieve this, CARMA uniquely identifies
physical instances of such entities in the real world and organizes them into
grounded triplets of actors, objects, and actions.
  To validate our approach, we conducted three experiments, where multiple
humans and a robot interact: collaborative pouring, handovers, and sorting.
These scenarios allow the assessment of the system's capabilities as to role
distinction, multi-actor awareness, and consistent instance identification. Our
experiments demonstrate that the system can reliably generate accurate
actor-action-object triplets, providing a structured and robust foundation for
applications requiring spatiotemporal reasoning and situated decision-making in
collaborative settings.

Abstract: We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to
perform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human
demonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand
motion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's
end-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot
motion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted
motion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with
plausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained
generalist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows
the human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot
actions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or
paired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes
with minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world
settings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the
retargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the
pre-trained generalist policy fails entirely. Project page:
