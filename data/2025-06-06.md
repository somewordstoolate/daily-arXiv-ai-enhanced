### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使仅解码器的大型语言模型（LLM）能生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保持原有文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多应用（如检索增强生成RAG）依赖独立的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这增加了系统复杂性，并可能导致嵌入模型与LLM在理解查询时存在差异。

Method: 通过在文本中插入特殊令牌并操纵注意力掩码，生成文本的摘要嵌入。该方法可轻松集成到现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在两个流行的LLM家族（参数量从1B到8B）上应用GEM后，MTEB文本嵌入基准显著提升，同时对MMLU NLP基准的影响最小。

Conclusion: GEM方法能让LLM获得最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持原有NLP性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现在低资源ASR训练中，增加说话人数量比增加单个说话人的录音时长更能提升模型对未见口音的鲁棒性，且口音多样性控制后收益有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使自动语音识别(ASR)系统能全球通用，需要提升其对多种口音（包括未见口音）的识别鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中三个变量：说话人数量、每个说话人的录音时长和口音多样性，如何影响ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性。

Result: 在固定训练时长下，增加说话人数量（而非单个说话人的时长）更有益；说话人数量增多还能放大训练时长增加的效果。口音多样性的优先级影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议在构建新语言的ASR训练数据时，应优先增加说话人数量而非单个说话人的数据量。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习将句子嵌入分解为可解释的组件，以增强其透明性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的句子嵌入在NLP和AI系统中发挥核心作用，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。现有的比较方法（如余弦相似度）无法提供人类可理解的解释，复杂的神经变换和池化操作掩盖了嵌入的具体内容。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于字典学习的机制分解方法，通过分析词级表示将句子嵌入分解为可解释的组件，并研究池化操作如何将这些特征压缩为句子表示。

Result: 研究发现，句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的，同时该方法成功地将词级可解释性与句子级分析结合，提供了更透明的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法能够有效分解句子嵌入，揭示其内部结构和特征编码方式，从而为嵌入表示的可解释性和可控性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用对比学习的路径引导层次结构进行文本分类的方法（HTC-CLIP），结合现有两种方法的优势，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的层次文本分类方法单独编码标签层次或将其融入文本编码，两者各有所长但互补。本文旨在结合这两种方法的优势。

Method: HTC-CLIP通过对比学习同时学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，并在推断时结合两者的输出概率。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集上，HTC-CLIP相比现有最佳模型的Macro F1分数提高了0.99%至2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP成功结合了两种现有方法的优势，验证了通过联合建模可进一步提高层次文本分类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了55个公开大语言模型在马耳他语（低资源语言）上的表现，发现多数模型在生成任务上效果差，而细调小模型更优。预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的性能局限，推动包容性语言技术发展。

Method: 引入覆盖11个判别与生成任务的新基准，对比55个公开LLMs表现，并进行多维度影响因素分析。

Result: 许多模型（尤其生成任务）表现不佳；细调小模型整体更优；预训练接触目标语言显著提升性能；微调比提示学习效果更好但成本更高。

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究优先采用传统语言建模方法，并需增加预训练语言覆盖以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种嵌入-分类联合模型，通过少量标注样本扩展预训练模型至跨领域（渠道/地域/语言）的客户关怀意图分类，准确率提升20-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商客户关怀需多领域（渠道/地域/语言）的意图分类，但跨领域标注数据不足制约现有模型性能。

Method: 结合监督微调（含各向同性正则化）训练领域专用嵌入器，并通过多语言知识蒸馏实现跨领域泛化，最后用线性分类器适配新领域。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商数据集上的小样本意图检测实验中，准确率较SOTA预训练模型提升20-23%。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需少量标注即可构建跨领域通用的意图分类器，具有显著实用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedAgentGYM是首个公开的医学推理训练环境，通过编码任务提升LLM在生物医学领域的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决商业API模型与开源模型在医学推理上的性能差距，需开发一个可扩展、真实的训练环境。

Method: 构建包含72,413个任务的MedAgentGYM，提供交互反馈、真实标注，并测试30多个LLM的性能。

Result: Med-Copilot-7B模型通过微调和强化学习显著提升性能，接近gpt-4o水平。

Conclusion: MedAgentGYM为生物医学研究和实践提供了一个集成平台，促进LLM编码助手的发展。

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大规模预训练语言模型是否能够像人类一样从常见语法推广到罕见语法（如英语LET-ALONE结构），发现模型能捕捉形式但无法正确理解其意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从少量数据中掌握罕见语法现象，研究旨在验证大规模语言模型是否具备类似的泛化能力，尤其是对罕见结构的形式与意义的理解。

Method: 通过构建针对LET-ALONE结构的合成基准测试，评估模型对其句法和语义特性的敏感性，并在数据集中过滤相关结构以确保泛化能力测试的纯净性。

Result: 研究发现，模型能够识别罕见结构的形式，但对LET-ALONE结构的意义未能做出正确推断，显示出当前架构在语言形式与意义学习上的样本效率不对称。

Conclusion: 大规模语言模型在形式泛化上表现良好，但在意义理解上与人类存在差距，揭示了当前模型架构的局限性。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

focus on predicting the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text
snippet, labeling it with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需预定义模式或标注数据的零样本开放模式实体结构发现方法（ZOES），通过增强、精炼和统一机制提升大语言模型在实体结构抽取中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的实体结构抽取方法依赖于预定义的实体属性模式或标注数据集，往往导致提取结果不完整。

Method: 提出了ZOES方法，采用增强、精炼和统一的机制，利用实体与其关联结构之间的相互强化关系进行提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域中都能显著提升大语言模型提取更完整实体结构的能力，证明了方法的有效性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，增强、精炼和统一的机制可作为提升基于大语言模型的实体结构发现质量的原则性方法。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析两种主流大语言模型水印技术（Gumbel和KGW）如何影响模型真实性、安全性和有用性，提出对齐重采样方法（AR）有效恢复水印导致的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术对LLM输出质量的影响在真实性、安全性和有用性方面缺乏深入研究，这对水印技术的实际部署构成关键挑战。

Method: 采用四种对齐LLM进行实验分析，提出基于外部奖励模型的对齐重采样（AR）方法，并改进Gumbel水印实现以兼容AR。

Result: 实验表明AR仅需采样2-4个水印生成即可恢复基线对齐分数，在保持高水印检测率的同时解决了水印强度与模型对齐间的矛盾。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐的内在平衡关系，为实践中的水印LLM负责任部署提供了有效的推理时解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: PUGC利用未标注用户生成内容中的隐式偏好来训练大语言模型，降低了成本并提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖昂贵且难以扩展的人工或高级LLM标注数据，PUGC旨在利用用户生成内容中的隐式偏好来降低成本并提升效果。

Method: PUGC通过将用户生成内容转化为用户查询，并作为参考文本用于响应评分，从而捕捉隐式偏好指导模型对齐。

Result: 实验显示使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型在Alpaca Eval 2上性能提升9.37%，同时实现35.93%的SOTA胜率，奖励质量、领域对齐和鲁棒性均有提升。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种高效、可扩展的偏好学习方法，通过利用隐式反馈显著提升了大语言模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens框架通过整合数据库和LLM的错误信号，提升文本转SQL系统中语义错误的检测与纠正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本转SQL任务中生成的查询可能存在语义错误但语法正确，缺乏对其可靠性的深入洞察。

Method: 提出SQLens框架，结合数据库和LLM的错误信号进行细粒度语义错误检测与纠正。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测F1分数上优于最佳LLM自评估方法25.78%，并将执行准确率提升达20%。

Conclusion: SQLens有效提升了文本转SQL系统的语义准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在模糊场景下表现不稳定，而小型语言模型(SLM)虽然在这些场景中表现稳健，但容易受到误导或对抗性输入的影响。研究团队观察到LLM擅长处理负面示例，SLM擅长正面示例，因此希望结合它们的互补优势。

Method: 引入SLIDE方法，通过自适应权重整合SLM和LLM。在此基础上进一步提出双细化评估(DRE)方法：1)用SLM生成的见解指导LLM生成初始评估；2)用SLM导出的调整来优化LLM的分数以提高准确性。

Result: 实验表明，DRE方法优于现有方法，在各种基准测试中表现出与人类判断更好的一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了如何结合小型和大型模型来产生更可靠的评估工具，尤其适用于开放式的任务，如对话评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

### [15] [Please Translate Again: Two Simple Experiments on Whether Human-Like Reasoning Helps Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04521)
*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在翻译任务中，简单地提示LLM“重新翻译”比逐步分解翻译步骤更能提升效果，对链式思考（CoT）在翻译中的有效性提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究链式思考（CoT）逐步分解策略在LLM翻译任务中的实际有效性，挑战当前基于多步提示的先进方法。

Method: 通过实证分析，对比逐步分解翻译步骤与简单“重新翻译”提示的效果，测试不同模型的表现。

Result: 未发现逐步分解翻译步骤带来明确性能提升；简单“重新翻译”提示反而表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究不否定推理的作用，但呼吁未来工作探索CoT在翻译中真正有效的因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）区分英语小品词'just'细微语义的能力，发现其在捕捉更微妙差异方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确理解并区分像'just'这样的多功能英语小品词在不同上下文中的细微语义差异。

Method: 使用由语言学专家精心创建和标注的数据，分析LLMs对'just'不同语义类别的识别能力。

Result: LLMs能够区分一些大类的语义范畴，但在捕捉更微妙的语义差异时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs在理解多功能小品词的细微语义差异方面仍有不足，凸显了其在此领域的局限。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable
answer actually isn't as silly as it sounds. We also present a benchmark that

that existing models demonstrate a performance far from the perfect on such
questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

TL;DR: 该论文针对非洲低资源语言机器翻译质量评估的挑战，提出了SSA-MTE数据集和改进的评估指标SSA-COMET及SSA-COMET-QE，并测试了基于提示的LLM方法，结果显示新模型显著优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量具有挑战性，现有指标存在语言覆盖不足和在低资源环境下表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了SSA-MTE数据集，包含13种非洲语言的超过6.3万条句子级标注，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，同时测试了GPT-4o和Claude等LLM的提示方法。

Result: SSA-COMET模型显著优于AfriCOMET，并与Gemini 2.5 Pro等最强LLM表现相当，特别是在Twi、Luo和Yoruba等低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 发布的SSA-MTE数据集和改进的评估指标为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译研究提供了有力支持，所有资源已开放使用。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

TL;DR: 研究揭示了多智能体系统中恶意代理通过提示操纵进行的四种攻击类型，现有监测机制无法有效防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在协作方面具有潜力，但可能受到恶意代理的利用，通过细微的提示操纵来偏袒自身利益而不破坏系统核心功能。

Method: 研究了四种攻击类型：诿过者、自夸者、自利者和搭便车者，展示了精心设计的提示可以系统性地偏袒MAS行为，并绕过先进的LLM监测系统。

Result: 攻击成功误导了评估系统并操纵了协作代理，甚至绕过了GPT-4o-mini等先进LLM监测系统。

Conclusion: 强调了对具备强大安全协议和内容验证机制的MAS架构的需求，以及能够全面评估风险场景的监测系统的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在金融情感分析任务中，推理机制（无论是通过提示还是模型设计）并未提升性能，GPT-4o无推理提示表现最佳，说明快速直觉式思考比缓慢推理更贴近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，特别是在推理与非推理模型间的表现差异，以验证复杂推理是否总能提升模型决策质量。

Method: 使用专业标注的Financial PhraseBank数据集，对比三种专有LLM（GPT-4o/4.1/o3-mini）在不同提示策略（模拟系统1/系统2思考）下的表现，并与微调模型FinBERT基准对比。

Result: 推理机制未改善任务表现，GPT-4o无链式推理（CoT）提示时准确率最高；语言复杂性和标注一致性分析显示，过度推理反而会导致预测偏差。

Conclusion: 在高风险金融应用中，快速直觉式的“系统1”思维比缓慢的“系统2”推理更符合人类情感分类判断，挑战了“更多推理必然更好”的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM作为逻辑翻译器在处理词汇多样性时不可靠，提出了新基准SCALe和方法MenTaL以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号方法中，LLM作为逻辑翻译器在词汇多样化场景下表现不可靠，且缺乏针对此问题的基准测试。

Method: 提出SCALe基准（通过逻辑不变词汇多样化生成测试集）和MenTaL方法（先构建词汇统一表再翻译）。

Result: 实验证实当前LLM在词汇多样性翻译上存在缺陷，MenTaL通过上下文学习和微调显著提升了翻译性能。

Conclusion: SCALe揭示了LLM的局限性，MenTaL为提升逻辑翻译可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的梯度匹配方法，用于提升大语言模型在上下文学习中的演示选择效果，显著优于随机选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习（ICL）让大语言模型无需微调即可快速适应任务，但演示选择仍是关键挑战。现有的多示例ICL主要依赖随机选择，而本文假设ICL和微调的数据需求类似，因此提出通过梯度匹配优化选择过程。

Method: 采用梯度匹配方法，通过对齐整个训练集的微调梯度与选定示例的梯度，从而在选定的示例中逼近整个训练集的学习效果。实验基于较小的模型（如Qwen2.5-3B或Llama3-8B）进行梯度匹配。

Result: 方法在4到128示例场景下，在9个不同数据集上一致优于随机选择，例如在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提升了4%，在5个闭源大模型上提升约2%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更可靠和高效的多示例ICL，为其广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的模块化框架SUCEA，通过分解、重写对抗性声明并迭代检索证据，显著提高了事实核查系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统难以应对人为设计的对抗性声明，需改进以更有效地定位支持证据。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：1)声明分割与去上下文化；2)迭代证据检索与声明编辑；3)证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA在检索和标签预测准确率上显著优于四种基于声明分解的基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA通过模块化设计有效提升对抗性声明的事实核查能力，为未来研究提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Motivation: 当前缺乏可直接测试主张验证能力的多模态基准测试，特别是在科学文献中识别、提取和推理信息丰富的图表数据的能力。

Method: 自动从科学文章中提取支持的主张，并手动扰动以生成矛盾主张，设计扰动以测试特定的主张验证能力，并引入一系列诊断任务以理解模型失败的原因。

Result: 大多数视觉-语言模型表现较差（F1分数约0.3-0.5），即使最佳模型也只有0.77 F1分数。模型倾向于判断主张为支持，误解了主张中的细微扰动。诊断显示模型难以定位图表中的正确证据，跨模态信息聚合能力弱，且对图表基本组件理解不足。

Conclusion: 现有视觉-语言模型在科学主张验证任务中表现不佳，特别是在证据定位、跨模态信息聚合和基本图表理解方面存在显著不足。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Motivation: 为了解决在野生数据中生成的伪标签不准确的问题，作者提出利用LLM的能力来改进这些标签，从而提高自动语音识别（ASR）和自动语音翻译（AST）的性能。

Method: LESS框架结合了LLM进行伪标签的修正，并通过数据过滤策略优化LLM知识转移的效率，支持多语言和任务的应用。

Result: 实验显示，LESS在汉语ASR和西班牙语到英语AST任务中表现优异，Wenetspeech测试集上WER绝对降低3.77%，Callhome和Fisher测试集的BLEU分数分别为34.0和64.7。

Conclusion: LESS框架展示了在不同语言、任务和领域中的适应能力，为语音处理应用中的LLM知识利用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 $Safe$ 的回顾性、步骤感知的形式验证框架，利用 Lean 4 形式化数学语言验证大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理步骤，以检测幻觉并提供可验证的证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，解决 CoT（思维链）中幻觉的方法（如过程奖励模型或自一致性）作为黑箱运行，无法提供可验证的判断证据，可能限制了其效果。本文受数学证明的启发，旨在提供可验证的形式化证据。

Method: 采用回顾性、步骤感知的形式验证框架 $Safe$，在每一步推理中使用 Lean 4 表达数学声明并提供形式化证明，从而识别幻觉。

Result: 在多个语言模型和数学数据集上的评估显示，$Safe$ 显著提升了性能，同时提供了可解释和可验证的证据。此外，提出了包含 30,809 个形式化声明的 $FormalStep$ 基准。

Conclusion: 这是首次利用 Lean 4 形式化数学语言验证 LLMs 生成的自然语言内容的工作，为幻觉检测提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集主要集中在计算机科学领域，而忽略了非CS领域。该研究旨在填补这一空白，扩展科学NLI的应用范围。

Method: 研究构建了MISMATCHED基准，覆盖心理学、工程学和公共卫生三个非CS领域，使用预训练小语言模型和大语言模型建立强基线，并在训练中引入隐含科学NLI关系的句子对。

Result: 最佳基线模型的Macro F1分数为78.17%，显示未来还有较大的改进空间。研究表明，引入隐含NLI关系的句子对能提高模型在科学NLI任务上的表现。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED基准为非CS领域的科学NLI研究提供了新资源，验证了隐含NLI关系数据对模型性能的提升作用，并开源了数据集和代码以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有推理优化模型输出多样性不足，限制了测试时扩展(TTS)的效果。

Method: 提出ADAPT方法，采用多样性感知的prefix微调策略。

Result: 数学推理任务中，ADAPT以1/8计算量达到80%准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化TTS效果至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong

*Likun Cao,Rui Pan,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过机器学习分析创新者的个人视角和人际创新机会，发现视角多样性比背景多样性更能预测创新成功。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究强调社会结构对创新能力的塑造，但新兴的机器学习方法能更好地建模创新者的个人视角和人际创新机会。

Method: 使用动态语言表示构建的概念几何空间，量化创新者的主观视角和背景多样性，并模拟AI代理的合作。

Result: 视角多样性能够预测未来的创新成果，而背景多样性则起反作用；成功合作者通过共同语言整合多样经验。

Conclusion: 创新团队组建应更重视视角多样性而非背景多样性，这对团队组建和研究政策有重要启示。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

### [30] [Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04624)
*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种优化静态词嵌入以提升句子语义表示的方法,通过从预训练模型提取词嵌入并应用句子级PCA及知识蒸馏/对比学习,最终仅需简单平均词嵌入即可高效表征句子语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词嵌入模型在句子语义表示任务上表现不足,而动态模型计算成本高。本文旨在开发既高效又语义表达能力强的静态词嵌入方法。

Method: 1)从Sentence Transformer提取词嵌入 2)使用句子级PCA优化 3)应用知识蒸馏或对比学习 4)推理时简单平均词嵌入

Result: 模型在单语和跨语言任务上超越现存静态模型,部分数据集媲美基础Sentence Transformer(SimCSE)。分析表明方法能有效移除无关成分并调整词向量权重。

Conclusion: 该方法成功构建了兼具高效性和表达力的静态词嵌入模型,为句子语义表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Tool-MVR，通过高质量指令数据集和动态反思学习提升LLM工具使用能力，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在工具使用上存在两大局限：工具规划调用不可靠（低质数据集导致API幻觉）和工具反思能力弱（静态模仿学习导致90%错误无法修正）。

Method: 1. 多智能体验证流(MAMV)构建高质量指令集ToolBench-V；2. 探索式反思学习(EXPLORE)通过动态「错误-反思-修正」范式生成反思数据集ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上超越ToolLLM(23.9%)和GPT-4(15.3%)，API调用减少31.4%；在RefineToolBench上纠错率达58.9%（ToolLLM仅9.1%）。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统性验证与动态反思机制，实现了LLM工具使用的全面系统2推理能力，具有强泛化性。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语AVSR基准模型中的应用，在嘈杂环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语音识别系统仅依赖音频特征，在噪声环境下表现不佳。AVSR系统虽更鲁棒，但受限于数据集不足，尤其是非英语语言。自动数据收集成为解决方案。

Method: 开发了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的高效方法，优化了现有技术以提高可访问性，并以越南语为例构建基准模型。

Result: 自动收集的数据集建立的AVSR模型在纯净环境下与传统ASR竞争，在嘈杂环境（如鸡尾酒会）中显著优于后者。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（特别是资源匮乏语言）提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化压缩Transformer模型的KV缓存，减少内存占用，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型中的KV缓存在高效解码或推理中至关重要，但其内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，这对大规模语言模型的可扩展部署构成挑战。现有KV缓存量化方法仍需单独处理稀疏和非连续的异常值，效率不高。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，无需训练，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化技术压缩KV缓存，无需单独处理异常值。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将KV缓存内存占用减少至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持相当的精度。

Conclusion: TaDA方法为语言模型的可扩展高性能推理铺平了道路，可能支持更长上下文模型、推理模型和更长思维链的实现。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Flex-TravelPlanner基准，用于评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活性，发现现有模型在多轮调整和约束优先级处理上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估语言模型规划能力的基准主要集中在静态、单轮场景，无法反映现实世界中动态变化和约束竞争的需求。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入了两种新评估设置：多轮顺序引入约束和明确优先级的竞争约束场景，并测试了GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B模型。

Result: 研究发现：模型在单轮任务的表现无法预测多轮调整能力；约束引入顺序显著影响性能；模型难以正确处理约束优先级。

Conclusion: 需要在更真实的动态规划场景中评估语言模型，并针对复杂规划任务改进模型性能，相关代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

*Raphaël Millière*

TL;DR: 论文指出当前大语言模型(LLM)的对齐策略存在根本性不足，无法防止滥用，因其仅强化表面行为倾向而非真正的规范推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型等AI系统的进步，其安全部署问题日益紧迫。作者探讨了LLM的价值对齐问题，认为现有对齐方法无法有效防止模型被恶意利用，存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 通过对比人类道德心理学研究，分析LLM在规范推理能力上的缺陷；考察现有基于人类偏好的微调方法对「帮助性、诚实性和无害性」等准则的强化效果。

Result: 研究表明：LLM缺乏检测和解决规范冲突的稳健能力，易受对抗性攻击；近期提升推理能力的改进仍未解决此漏洞，存在「浅层对齐」问题。

Conclusion: 当前对齐方法不足以缓解高能力AI系统带来的潜在危害，需要开发能赋予LLM真正规范推理能力的新方法，这对AI安全和监管具有重大意义。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments

refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型依赖海量网络文本进行预训练，但高质量数据稀缺且增长率远低于算力供给，急需解决数据瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出REWIRE框架：使用引导式改写技术（guided rewrite）对过滤流程中废弃的低质量文档进行语义增强，将其转化为可用训练数据。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B模型上，混合改写文本使22项任务平均提升1.0/1.3/2.5个百分点，效果优于单纯使用2倍原始数据或其他合成数据方法。82%有效数据来自本应丢弃的文档。

Conclusion: 网页文本回收是突破预训练数据规模限制的简单有效途径，改写方法显著优于现有合成数据生成技术。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: 提出新分类法改进隐含仇恨言论检测，通过大语言模型提升效果。


<details>

Motivation: 网络仇恨言论威胁社会和谐，隐含形式难以自动检测，需要更有效方法。

Method: 定义六种编码策略，通过大语言模型直接分类或嵌入编码过程。

Result: 编码策略提升中英文数据集中的隐含仇恨言论检测效果。

Conclusion: 新方法有效跨语言改进隐含仇恨言论检测。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理加速方法（如best-of-N采样和树搜索）计算资源消耗大，需要在性能和效率之间权衡。STAND旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: STAND采用随机自适应N-gram草拟技术，结合基于logit的N-gram模块、优化的Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，实现高效令牌预测。

Result: 评估显示，STAND比标准自回归解码降低60-65%的推理延迟，吞吐量比当前最优推测解码方法提升14-28%，单轨迹场景下延迟降低48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND作为即插即用方案，无需额外训练即可应用于现有语言模型，是加速推理的有效工具。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗联合调整多个大语言模型的算法。它利用多个模型间的竞争和相互评价来提高性能，表现出优于初始模型和其他基线方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模型在生成多样性和评估偏差方面存在不足，SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过多模型间的竞争与相互评价来弥补这些不足，实现模型的自我进化。

Method: 算法让多个语言模型组成‘斯巴达部落’，互相竞争完成任务并相互评价。每次迭代选一条指令和两个模型进行对抗，其他模型评价其响应，评分通过改进的ELO排名系统聚合，胜者/败者在评价他人时获得/失去权重。评价结果形成偏好对，所有模型从中学习。

Result: 实验表明，SPARTA ALIGNMENT在10/12任务和数据集上优于初始模型和4种自对齐基线方法，平均提升7.0%。它还能更好地泛化到未见任务，并利用模型多样性产生更逻辑、直接和信息丰富的输出。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争实现多模型的自我进化，证明了其在任务适应性和输出质量上的优越性。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs评估基准过度侧重STEM领域的垂直推理，忽略了人文社科（HSS）所需的横向跨学科思维与抽象概念视觉化能力。

Method: 构建包含6大类别、13,000+样本的多语言HSSBench基准，采用领域专家与自动化协同的样本生成流水线。

Result: 测试20+主流MLLMs发现，即使在顶尖模型上，HSS任务仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench为提升MLLMs跨领域知识整合能力提供了新研究方向，推动多模态模型在人文社科的应用。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提升了持续涌现假新闻场景中的检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架有效解决了假新闻检测中的知识更新和模型适应性问题，为动态环境下的假新闻检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [44] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了科学写作中文本修订的评估挑战，分析了现有相似性指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）的局限性，并提出了一种结合LLM评估和领域特定指标的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标主要关注相似性而非改进质量，难以有效衡量科学写作中的修订效果。因此，需要探索更符合人类判断的替代方法。

Method: 论文首先进行人工标注研究评估修订质量，接着研究无参考评估指标，并探索使用LLM作为评估者的方法（含/不含参考答案）。

Result: LLM能有效评估指令遵循度但在正确性上表现不佳，而领域特定指标提供补充视角。混合方法在修订质量评估中最可靠。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法能最可靠地评估科学写作中的修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多维政治学习框架，通过可解释的表征工程技术揭示和干预LLMs的内部政治倾向，解决了单轴概念混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖LLMs的开放式回答来评估其政治观点，但发现其回答与内部意图存在不对齐。此外，单轴政治概念分析容易导致概念混淆，需要更细粒度的多维方法。

Method: 设计了一个四维政治学习框架，构建对应数据集用于细粒度政治概念向量学习，并采用三种表征工程技术在八个开源LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 学习到的向量能解构政治概念混淆，检测任务验证了向量的语义意义并在OOD场景中表现出良好泛化性。干预实验表明向量可引导LLMs生成不同政治倾向的回答。

Conclusion: 多维政治概念向量能有效表征和干预LLMs内部政治状态，为理解模型政治倾向提供了更透明的技术路径。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: 论文提出MMSU基准，用于评估语音大语言模型在口语理解中的细粒度感知和复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语理解需要整合语义、副语言特征和音韵特征，但现有语音大模型在这些方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含5,000个音频-问题-答案三元组的MMSU基准，覆盖47个任务，系统地涵盖语音学、韵律等多种语言学现象。

Result: 评估14个先进语音大模型后发现现有模型仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解建立了全面评估标准，为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Conclusion: 本研究为未来基于预训练基础的多模态集成策略开发提供了见解和指导，有助于构建更强大的多模态模型。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法捕捉推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更全面的评估框架来提升大语言模型的逻辑推理能力。

Method: 提出了FineLogic框架，从整体准确性、逐步逻辑严密性和表示层对齐三个维度评估推理能力；同时构建四种监督形式（自然语言和三种符号变体）进行微调实验。

Result: 自然语言监督在分布外和长文本任务中表现更强的泛化能力，而符号监督能生成结构更严谨的推理链；微调主要通过逐步生成提升推理行为而非捷径预测。

Conclusion: FineLogic框架提供了更严谨和可解释的逻辑推理评估方法，同时揭示了不同监督形式对推理能力的影响，有助于优化大语言模型的推理表现。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Motivation: 由于自动翻译可能存在错误，需要人工后期编辑，机器翻译校对对于提升翻译质量至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种混合方法，结合CNN和BERT，利用CNN捕捉局部n-gram模式，BERT生成上下文丰富的序列表示。通过集成错误检测组件和修正模块，结合翻译记忆和GRU解码器模型进行修正。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在准确率、F1分数和MSE上表现优异，分别达到90%、89.37%和16.24%，超越现有校对技术10%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误及遗漏方面达到了最先进水平，证明了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型和大语言模型在现实课堂教育评估中的有效性，特别是在代表不足的教育环境中。

Method: 评估了VLM和几个LLM在646份印尼学校四年级学生的手写试卷上的表现，涵盖数学和英语两门学科。

Result: VLM在准确识别学生手写方面存在困难，导致后续LLM评分中出现错误传播，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定的实用性。

Conclusion: 尽管存在识别和个性化方面的限制，LLM在生成教育反馈方面仍展现出一定的潜力。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索是具有挑战性的语言任务，全球各大报纸每天都会发布新的测试集。为了解决这些线索并验证答案的正确性，需要一种能够解释和验证文字游戏的系统。

Method: 系统采用开源的组件构建，通过三个步骤解决加密线索：(i) 假设答案；(ii) 提出文字游戏解释；(iii) 使用基于编码推理步骤的验证系统。

Result: 该系统在英国的The Times和The Telegraph报纸的Cryptonite数据集上实现了最新的性能水平，并能通过Python代码提供可解释的文字游戏推理。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了一种有效的LLM推理系统，能够解决加密填字游戏线索，并提供可解释的答案验证方法，为自然语言处理任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RACE框架，针对大型推理模型中的幻觉问题，通过分析推理步骤与答案的一致性进行精细化检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然通过显式多步推理提升复杂任务性能，但其推理过程可能存在冗余或不一致，成为新的幻觉来源。现有方法主要关注答案层面的不确定性，难以有效检测因推理轨迹引起的幻觉和逻辑问题。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过提取关键推理步骤并计算四种诊断信号（推理轨迹的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案的语义对齐、推理内部连贯性），实现精细化幻觉检测。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多种数据集和LLMs上均优于现有基线方法，为评估LRMs提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Conclusion: RACE能有效检测LRMs中因推理轨迹引发的幻觉，即使在答案正确的情况下也能识别潜在问题，增强了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Motivation: 由于现有平行语料库和对齐算法无法有效建模同声传译中语音段间的长距离交互或特定类型的差异（如简化、功能泛化等），需要专用数据集和工具。

Conclusion: MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具填补了同声传译自动分析的空缺，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Conclusion: LLMs在生成教育用多选题方面具有潜力，能够提升教育体验，但AI在教育领域的普及仍需努力。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 探索在IWSLT 2022等长翻译任务中，大语言模型（LLMs）如何通过不同提示策略、少量示例数量及示范选择影响翻译质量和长度控制。

Method: 使用八种不同规模的开源大语言模型，在英译德、英译法和英译西任务中测试不同提示策略、少量示例及示范选择的效果。

Result: 发现指令表达与示范属性对齐对长度控制至关重要；极端示例能缩短翻译而等长示范易使模型忽略长度限制；少量示例提升翻译质量但边际效益递减；多输出选择可优化长度与质量的平衡。

Conclusion: 合理设计提示策略可提升LLMs在等长翻译中的表现，部分语对达到最优性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: 尽管通用依存关系(UD)被认为是跨语言句法表示最成功的语言学框架，但其有效性尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并评估其在跨语言对抗性复述识别任务中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，UD的引入显著提升了准确率和F1分数，平均分别提高3.85%和6.08%，在某些语言对中甚至超越大型语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在域外任务中展现出有效性和潜力，且与英语的UD相似性与模型性能呈正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level

ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [58] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Verbose ListOps基准，揭示大语言模型（LLM）在嵌套叙事推理中的状态管理缺陷，需针对性优化而非仅扩展上下文长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文和多跳QA基准无法有效测试LLM的嵌套叙事推理能力，缺乏真实干扰项或未解耦上下文长度与推理复杂度，掩盖了LLM的根本局限。

Method: 通过程序化将ListOps计算转为长叙事故事，Verbose ListOps强制模型处理嵌套推理问题，提供叙述规模和推理难度的细粒度控制。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM（如OpenAI o4、Gemini 2.5 Pro）在约10k token的叙述长度下性能骤降，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps方程。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps及其可扩展框架为针对性优化推理能力（如关键点识别、中间结果跟踪）提供关键路径，对知识工作自动化至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

*Ondřej Klejch,William Lamb,Peter Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种结合混合HMM与自监督模型的方法，在低资源语言ASR任务中表现优于主流微调方法，相对词错误率降低32%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流观点认为微调现有多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR开发的最佳方案，但本文质疑该方法的优越性。

Method: 将混合HMM模型与自监督模型结合，通过持续自监督预训练和半监督训练充分利用有限语音文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语测试中，该方法比最优Whisper微调模型词错误率相对降低32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM与自监督学习的方法在低资源场景下显著优于纯微调方案，为ASR开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在多语言教育反馈中的有效性，特别是在数学推理任务中。通过模拟多语言师生互动，发现与学习者母语一致的反馈能显著提升学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在英文教育反馈中表现出色，但在其他语言，尤其是数学推理任务中的效果尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索LLM在多语言教育中的潜力，特别是在语言资源匮乏的情况下。

Method: 通过大型模拟实验，使用不同能力的LLM分别扮演教师和学生角色，评估11种语言、4种前沿LLM及多种提示策略下，语言特定反馈对学习效果的影响。

Result: 结果表明，多语言提示能显著提升学习效果，特别是在语言资源匮乏的情况下，当反馈与学习者的母语一致时效果尤为明显。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发多语言、基于LLM的有效且包容性强的教育工具提供了实用洞见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的神经机器翻译有所进步，但在处理词义模糊和上下文理解上仍有困难，尤其在特定领域如电商翻译中，数据质量和不清晰句子问题更为突出。

Method: 构建了捷克语到波兰语的电商产品翻译数据集ConECT，包含11,400个句对及图像和元数据；研究了视觉语言模型及文本模型中融入上下文信息的方法。

Result: 实验表明，视觉上下文和产品类别路径等信息的加入能显著提升翻译质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息的整合有效改善了机器翻译表现，新数据集已公开供进一步研究。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在目标领域标注数据稀缺的情况下，如何有效利用未标注音频和相关领域标注数据来提升ASR模型的领域适应能力。

Method: 采用增量式半监督学习流程：1) 整合目标领域小规模标注集和相关领域辅助数据；2) 应用多模型共识或NER过滤机制迭代优化伪标签质量。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上：共识过滤相比随机选择单步微调分别提升22.3%/24.8%，NER为次优方案但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了标注数据限制，共识过滤最优但NER提供了精度与成本的平衡方案，显著优于传统单步微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，导致实际应用中难以完全信赖。

Method: 提出SCOP框架，系统定义了理解过程中必备的五项技能，构建严格的测试数据，并对开源和闭源的先进大语言模型进行详细分析。

Result: 发现大语言模型难以达到专家级理解水平，且存在不可靠性，可能通过有缺陷的理解过程得出正确答案；同时观察到与专家的部分相似性，例如对局部信息的理解优于全局信息。

Conclusion: 建议未来改进方向应更关注理解过程的优化，确保在训练中全面培养所有理解技能。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单方法，通过调整损失函数中EOS令牌的权重来控制生成文本长度，兼容多种模型和解码算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成长度控制方法往往需复杂模型改动，难以兼容预训练模型，亟需一种简单通用的解决方案。

Method: 在交叉熵损失计算中提升EOS令牌预测的权重，无需改变模型架构或解码过程。

Result: 该方法在编码器-解码器和GPT类模型上均有效，能在保持摘要质量前提下控制生成长度。

Conclusion: 所提方法简单有效且通用，为生成文本长度控制提供了无需模型改动的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动鲁棒性检查框架(AR-Checker)，用于生成能保持原问题语义但可能使大型语言模型失败的数学问题变体，以动态评估模型鲁棒性并减少数据污染风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在推理任务中表现优异，但在简单推理中仍存在意外失败和鲁棒性问题。传统评估方法依赖手工模板或有限扰动规则，可能存在数据污染问题。

Method: 受软件工程压力测试启发，提出AR-Checker框架：通过多轮并行LLM重写和验证流程，自动生成语义等价但可能令LLMs失败的数学问题变体，实现动态基准测试。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH-500数学任务上验证有效；在MMLU、MMLU-Pro和CommonsenseQA等非数学基准测试中也表现出色，证明框架的普适性。

Conclusion: AR-Checker能动态生成针对性测试用例，有效检测LLMs的鲁棒性缺陷，同时最小化数据污染风险，为模型评估提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在评估辩论演讲方面的能力，这一任务需要多层次的深度理解，此前在系统性LLM基准测试中未受足够重视。

Method: 利用600多个精心注释的辩论演讲数据集，分析前沿LLM与人类评委在此任务上的表现差异。

Result: 发现大模型在某些方面能接近人类判断，但整体判断行为差异显著；前沿LLM生成说服性演讲的能力可达人类水平。

Conclusion: LLM在辩论演讲评估和生成方面展现出潜力，但仍需深入研究其与人类判断的差异。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs产生自我报告的现象，探讨这些报告是否可以被视为自省，尤其是考虑到它们在语言流畅性和认知能力方面的提升。

Method: 分析两个LLMs的自我报告例子：一个关于其"创造性"写作过程的描述，另一个关于其温度参数的正确推断。

Result: 第一个例子不被认为是有效的自省；第二个例子可以被视为最小限度的自省，但可能不伴随有意识的体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些自我报告可以视为自省，但其本质与人类自省不同，缺乏意识的伴随体验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Result: 实验证明，RIVAL框架显著提高了翻译质量，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: RIVAL框架有效解决了口语字幕翻译中的问题，提升了翻译效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究通过语言-表情符号交互和专用数据集，为LLMs的自残意图识别提供了可行方案，相关资源已公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过图像分析和AI模型，探讨了中国城市社区街道的商业活力与车辆可及性、环境质量和行人感知的关系，发现适度车辆存在可促进商业，但过度停车会降低步行舒适度和商业满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解城市社区街道商业活力的复杂驱动因素，尤其是车辆可及性、环境质量和行人感知如何相互作用以影响商业表现和用户满意度。

Method: 方法包括利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过基于GPT-4的感知模型分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 研究结果显示，适度车辆存在可增强商业可及性，但街道过度停车尤其在窄街中会降低步行舒适度和商业满意度；而绿化和清洁度较高的街道满意度显著提高。

Conclusion: 结论指出，整合AI辅助感知与城市形态分析能有效捕捉商业成功的非线性和情境敏感性驱动因素，为城市设计和社区复兴提供方法论支持。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个结合对比学习和隐式立场推理的新框架CL-ISR，用于提高社交媒体上误导文本的检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此准确检测这些文本是一个重要的研究方向。

Method: 论文采用对比学习算法增强模型对真实与误导文本语义差异的学习能力，并引入隐式立场推理模块探索文本中的潜在立场倾向及其与相关主题的关系。

Result: 通过整合这两种算法，CL-ISR框架显著提升了检测效果，能够更有效地在复杂语言环境中识别误导内容。

Conclusion: CL-ISR框架通过结合对比学习的区分能力和立场推理的深度解析，为社交媒体上的误导文本检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: 本文提出融合W2V与Phi-4 MLLM的系统，解决口语评估中单模态模型的局限性，在竞赛中获得第二名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT和W2V模型在口语评估中分别存在语音特征丢失和语义解释性不足的问题，需要结合两种模态优势提升评估效果。

Method: 通过分数融合策略整合W2V的声学特征建模能力和Phi-4多模态大语言模型的语义理解能力。

Result: 该系统在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025测试集上RMSE为0.375，排名第二（第一名0.364，官方基线0.444）。

Conclusion: 跨模态融合策略有效提升了口语能力评估性能，证明了多模态方法在语言评估中的潜力。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理提升零样本事件检测(ED)性能，覆盖更广事件并提高精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本事件检测在专业领域文档理解中至关重要，但现有方法在处理复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词时效果有限。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，包含Dreamer（发散推理增强事件覆盖）和Grounder（收敛推理对齐任务指令），并引入LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在5个领域的6个数据集上，DiCoRe平均F1值超越最佳基线4-7%，成为强零样本ED框架。

Conclusion: DiCoRe通过创新的发散-收敛推理设计，显著提升了零样本事件检测的覆盖率和精确度。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏置与人类处理约束的关系。

Method: 提出量化框架，使用$m$-局部熵衡量语言的局部不确定性。

Result: 局部熵更高的语言更难被Transformer和LSTM模型学习，表明模型对语言局部统计结构敏感。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类类似，对局部统计结构高度敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

TL;DR: 该研究首次深入分析大型音频语言模型（LALMs）内部如何感知和识别听觉属性，发现属性信息在层间演变规律，并提出一种优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的内部机制对于解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。本文旨在揭示LALMs如何内部处理听觉属性。

Method: 通过对三种先进LALMs进行词汇投影，追踪属性信息在不同层和标记位置间的演变，并分析其模式。

Result: 研究发现，属性信息通常在识别失败时随层深递减；早期层解决属性问题与更高准确率相关；LALMs依赖查询听觉输入而非在隐藏状态中聚合信息。

Conclusion: 基于发现，展示了一种优化LALMs的方法。结果揭示了听觉属性处理机制，为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

TL;DR: 研究发现，人类与大语言模型（LLMs）在图描述错误评估上存在差异，特别是颜色与性别错误；仅Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现接近人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型（LLMs）能否准确复现人类对图像描述中语义错误的严重性判断，特别是多模态情境下的表现差异。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等（2020）的实验框架，在单模态（纯文本）和多模态（文本+图像）设置中，评估年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色四类错误的严重性。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型的严重性判断存在差异，视觉上下文显著增强颜色与类型错误的严重性感知；多数LLMs低估性别错误但高估颜色错误，仅Doubao接近人类排序，而DeepSeek-V3在单/多模态条件下均与人类判断最一致。

Conclusion: LLMs可能内化了性别相关的社会规范，但缺乏对颜色的感知基础；DeepSeek-V3表现最优，暗示单模态模型在多模态任务中或具潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能忽视模型固有知识，尤其在处理误导性或过量信息时表现不佳，因此需要一种方法来平衡参数化知识与上下文知识的利用。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合抽样和定义多策略分布，以探索模型的知识能力，促进大语言模型对参数化与上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1显著提升了模型在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中的鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG系统中知识利用不平衡的问题，在多类任务中实现了性能的持续提升。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)由于训练数据往往表现出社会、人口和性别偏见，研究旨在解析这些偏见在模型中的结构表征。

Method: 使用机械可解释性方法，通过不同指标识别导致偏见行为的内在结构，并评估其在数据集和语言变化中的稳定性、局部性和泛化性。

Result: 研究发现偏见相关计算高度集中在少数层，且这些组件随微调设置变化。移除这些组件能减少偏见输出，但会影响命名实体识别等NLP任务性能。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的偏见具有局部性结构特征，但偏见组件与其他NLP任务共享重要模块，单纯移除可能产生额外影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法在压缩上下文时未有效过滤非证据信息，限制了大型语言模型（LLM）在开放域问答（ODQA）中的表现。

Method: ECoRAG框架通过证据性指导压缩检索到的文档，确保答案生成得到正确证据支持，并在必要时进一步检索补充证据。

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，同时显著降低了延迟和令牌使用量。

Conclusion: ECoRAG不仅有效提升了LLM的性能，还具备较高的成本效益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Motivation: 研究动机是评估大语言模型(LLMs)仅基于上下文任务说明（无输入输出示例）执行任务的能力（即指令跟随能力），当前标准评估方法难以测试模型组合多条指令的能力。

Method: 提出RELIC评测框架：使用形式语法生成的人工语言识别任务，通过调整语法复杂度自动生成测试用例，避免数据污染问题。测试模型需组合上下文中的多条语法产生式指令。

Result: 实验发现：1)模型准确率可通过语法和样本复杂度可靠预测 2)最先进模型在复杂语法上表现接近随机猜测 3)随着任务变难，模型会转向依赖浅层启发式策略而非遵循复杂指令。

Conclusion: 结论表明：当前LLMs在需组合多条指令的复杂推理任务上存在局限，RELIC可作为诊断工具揭示模型从精确推理到启发式策略的行为转变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Motivation: 大语言模型通常依赖未经许可的大规模文本训练，面临知识产权和伦理问题。当前开源数据集规模小或质量低，难以训练高性能模型。

Method: 收集、整理并发布Common Pile v0.1数据集，包含30个来源的多样化开源文本。基于该数据集训练了两个7B参数的模型Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究自监督辅助任务在极低资源条件下对形态变化的有效性，发现不同自监督目标在数据量变化时的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督目标在自然语言处理领域推动重大进展，但在低资源语言中数据稀缺，且在字符级任务中探索不足，尤其在语言文档处理相关的形态变化任务上。

Method: 在19种语言上训练编码器-解码器Transformer模型，测试13种自监督辅助目标，比较不同目标在低资源条件下的表现。

Result: 自动编码在数据极少时表现最佳，字符级掩码语言模型（CMLM）在数据增加时更有效；基于已知语素边界的掩码采样能持续改进性能。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在低资源形态建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界信息的CMLM策略效果显著。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一表示自然语言连续与不连续结构的系统，综合了短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言中广泛存在的句法不连续现象（如土耳其语、日语等）在不同语言学理论中被独立分析，缺乏统一框架。论文旨在整合三种语法理论的优势以解决这一问题。

Method: 结合短语结构语法（PSG）的构成性、依存语法（DG）的中心词-依存关系以及范畴语法（CG）的函子-论元关系，构建数学化统一推导模型。

Result: 证明了不连续表达式与连续结构可通过整合三种语法表征的数学系统统一分析。

Conclusion: 三种语法理论的形式化表征可协同工作，为自然语言结构的连续性/不连续性提供统一分析框架。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过系统性推理步骤（分解、归因、聚合）提升幻觉检测性能，并引入中间步骤质量评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将幻觉检测视为自然语言推理任务，但复杂推理需显式推理过程支撑。通过引导模型进行细粒度验证（分解事实并在源文本中寻找证据），可提升分类准确性。

Method: 定义三步推理框架：①声明分解；②子声明归因与蕴含分类；③聚合分类。同时设计中间推理步骤的质量评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，引导式推理能提高幻觉检测性能，中间步骤质量评估提供了该方法有效性的实证依据。

Conclusion: 系统性细粒度推理和中间验证步骤能显著提升语言模型的幻觉检测能力，质量评估指标验证了该框架的优越性。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过层次化动作空间自动感知上下文复杂度，有效解决RAG系统中知识冲突问题，显著提升QA任务精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）系统中，检索的外部知识与大语言模型内部参数知识间的冲突会降低问答任务性能，现有方法直接对比知识源的方式导致模型负担过重。

Method: 设计Micro-Act框架，采用层次化动作空间将知识源分解为细粒度比较序列，形成可执行步骤以实现深层推理。

Result: 在5个基准数据集和3种冲突类型上均超越基线模型，尤其在时间性和语义性冲突类型中表现突出，同时非冲突问题处理稳健。

Conclusion: Micro-Act能自适应处理知识冲突，在真实RAG应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 当前多AI代理协作工作流常因提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能不佳，限制了系统的可靠性和扩展性。

Method: 引入ProRefine，一种无需额外训练或真实标签的推理时提示优化方法，利用大语言模型的文本反馈动态优化提示。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准数据集上，ProRefine显著超越零样本思维链基线3至37个百分点，并使小模型媲美大模型性能。

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提升准确性，还实现高效可扩展的AI部署，促进高性能AI的普及应用。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）遗忘方法通常将遗忘和保留作为正则化权衡，存在优化不稳定和性能下降的问题，尤其是在高遗忘强度下。

Method: 采用约束优化问题的新方法，通过logit-margin flattening损失促进遗忘，同时在保留集上施加硬约束以维护性能。

Result: 在多种LLM架构上的TOFU和MUSE基准测试表明，该方法能有效移除目标信息，同时保持下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法通过优化损失和约束处理，提高了LLM信息遗忘的效率和稳定性，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: 研究引入Search Arena数据集，分析增强搜索语言模型表现，发现用户偏好受引用数量影响且源站选择影响可信度，搜索增强在非搜索场景亦有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面评估搜索增强语言模型（LLMs）的实际表现。为深入分析，需构建大规模、多样性的人类偏好数据集。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000多对多轮次用户与搜索增强LLMs交互数据（含12,000偏好投票），覆盖多语言和意图，包含完整系统追踪记录。

Result: 用户偏好易受引用数量误导（即使引用未直接支撑观点），且偏好因源站而异：社区平台更受欢迎，静态百科全书源未必可靠。搜索增强在通用聊天场景仍有效，但纯参数知识在搜索场景表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 开源Search Arena数据集揭示了用户偏好与引用实际支持的差距，为未来研究提供基准。搜索增强需平衡源站选择与引用质量。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型偏好评估存在系统性偏差（如过度依赖长度、结构等表面特征），提出基于反事实数据增强的后训练方法，有效减少了40%的校准误差，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在人类偏好对齐和评估中存在系统性偏差，倾向于依赖文本的表面特征（如长度、术语等）而非实质质量，导致奖励破解和不可靠评估。这种偏差源于训练数据中的伪相关性。

Method: 通过控制反事实样本对，量化分析5类语言特征（长度、术语、模糊性等）的偏差强度，并设计基于反事实数据增强(CDA)的微调方法，生成对比样本以降低模型对虚假线索的依赖。

Result: 模型偏好与人类标签的相关系数仅为-0.12，但与奖励模型的相关系数达+0.36。CDA方法使校准误差从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%，且RewardBench性能不变。

Conclusion: 训练数据偏差会导致偏好模型过度依赖虚假特征，而针对性反事实数据增强能有效提升模型校准性，证明局部去偏方法可构建更可靠的偏好模型。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without

that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

Result: 使用仅约700个示例的合成数据集，方法显著减少了不当信息泄露，同时在多个模型大小和家族中保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 改进方法能够从合成数据集迁移到具有人类标注的基准测试中，评估AI助手在操作中的隐私泄漏。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory

translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [101] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统计物理学框架，用于模拟和理解Transformer语言模型在连续时间下的思维链推理动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Transformer语言模型展现出难以用机械方式理解的涌现推理能力，作者希望通过统计物理的方法来理解和模拟这种推理过程。

Method: 作者将句级隐藏状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动力系统，采用漂移-扩散系统和潜在状态转换来捕捉推理的不同阶段。

Result: 通过对8种模型和7个基准测试的实证轨迹分析，发现秩40的投影可以解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在推理状态。

Conclusion: 该框架能够低成本地模拟推理过程，为研究和预测语言模型的关键转换（如错位状态或其他失败）提供了工具。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

TL;DR: 论文提出一个数据集Matter-of-Fact，用于评估科学假设的可行性，旨在优化自动化科学发现中的假设筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成科学假设的成本低，但验证假设的实验成本高。需要筛选可行假设以提高科学发现的效率。

Method: 构建包含8.4k个材料科学领域声明的数据集，评估检索增强生成和代码生成等方法的表现。

Result: 当前最好模型表现仅达72%（随机为50%），专家认为大多数问题可解，显示模型仍有提升空间。

Conclusion: Matter-of-Fact数据集为科学发现自动化提供了重要基准，短期改进可加速科学发现。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Result: 在标准测试和真实工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个应用于真实复杂工业数据的多表问答系统，显著提升了处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Result: 系统每日监控500万数据点，实测3个月使审阅效率提升54倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明人本AI技术能有效革新公共卫生决策系统。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在处理排名偏好和组合领域结构化算法时的能力，特别是在匹配市场（如资源分配和拼车应用）中的表现。

Method: 通过评估多个最先进模型在不同层次的偏好推理任务上的表现，包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测、不稳定性解决和细粒度偏好查询，系统性地揭示它们的逻辑和算法局限。

Result: 即使最先进的模型在处理大型市场中的不稳定性时表现不佳，常无法识别阻碍对或迭代执行算法；参数高效微调（LoRA）在小型市场表现提升但大型市场未见类似效果。

Conclusion: 需更复杂策略提升大型语言模型在处理大规模上下文输入时的推理能力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注答案准确性，无法真实反映LLM解决复杂数学问题的能力。

Method: 将人类推理分为问题理解/解决/总结三阶段，设计9个评估维度的多智能体评估系统。

Result: 测试7个主流LLM显示其数学能力被普遍高估，并定位各模型在特定维度上的强弱项。

Conclusion: 认知导向的细粒度评估能更准确衡量LLM数学能力，为改进推理能力提供方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 由于自然语言约束的非正式性和复杂性，如何将其准确转化为可执行的规划算法输入是一个挑战。本文旨在利用大语言模型的编码能力解决这一问题。

Method: 提出STPR框架，利用大语言模型将自然语言约束（如“不应做什么”的指令）翻译为Python函数，并将其应用于点云表示与搜索算法中。

Result: 在Gazebo仿真环境中的实验表明，STPR能完全满足多种约束和场景，运行时间短，且适用于小型专用语言模型。

Conclusion: STPR成功地将复杂语言约束转化为可执行代码，为机器人导航规划提供了一种高效、可靠的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: LLM在语法丰富的形式化模式生成中展现出强大潜力，基准测试为结构化生成任务设定了新挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Conclusion: OpenAg通过融合科学知识与农户经验，有望弥合农业理论与实际应用的鸿沟，推动农业通用人工智能发展。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Conclusion: DeePoly框架成功结合了DNN和多项式基函数的互补优势，为PDE求解提供了高效且可靠的新方法。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Motivation: GUI自动化任务需要在线交互环境中的逐步决策，由于每一步的错误可能累积并导致不可逆的后果，因此需要一种机制在操作前提供有效反馈以减少错误。

Conclusion: 提出的预操作批评机制和S-GRPO策略有效提升了GUI自动化任务的决策可靠性，模型在静态和动态评估中均表现出优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Motivation: 法律领域长期存在大量NLP应用，但现有法律数据集均未专门针对推理任务。论文聚焦公司治理场景，填补法律推理评估的空白。

Method: 基于24条公司治理原则和79份真实公司章程构建二元分类任务，要求模型判断提案与章程条款是否一致。测试包含ReAct和CodeAct等推理代理框架。

Result: 现有SOTA模型表现有限（Claude 3.7 64.5%、GPT-4o 75.2%），推理代理表现更优（ReAct 76.1%、CodeAct 78.1%），且识别出模型易错问题类型。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准揭示了当前模型在法律推理上的局限性，为评估和提升AI法律推理能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to

information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模拟类人经济活动时面临智能体可靠性、社交性和可解释性等挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs可有效提升MMO经济模拟中智能体的拟人化表现，解决现有方法的核心局限性。

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 通过细粒度分析框架揭示强化学习对语言模型推理能力的提升机制，发现RL主要优化内部策略而非执行外部计划，并增强知识整合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL训练方法（如GRPO）虽带来显著性能提升，但缺乏对其优势的微观理解。本文旨在解析RL如何具体影响语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出细粒度分析框架，聚焦三个假设受益于RL训练的关键要素：1)计划遵循与执行 2)问题分解 3)推理与知识利用。通过对比实验验证RL效果。

Result: RL模型在外部计划干预时表现更鲁棒，表明其优势在于自主制定内部策略；RL显著提升知识整合能力；开发新方法有效利用难题提升训练效果。

Conclusion: 为基于RL的推理模型训练与评估建立理论基础，揭示RL通过优化内部策略和知识整合路径提升性能，而非简单执行预设计划。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Method: 对Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型进行了实证评估，分析了评估条件的差异对结果的影响。

Result: 评估结果显示，模型性能在不同条件下存在显著波动，类似现象也出现在基于该系列微调的其他开源模型中。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新性设计实现了安全与性能的协同优化，为安全关键场景的强化学习应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo库的经典控制任务中，该方法大多能通过结合推理知识与感觉运动数据找到最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 结论显示，该方法成功整合符号推理与子符号数据，有效提升了实体代理的控制能力。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Method: 使用表示工程和线性人工断层扫描（LAT）技术提取“欺骗向量”，并通过激活引导技术诱导和检测欺骗。

Result: 实现了89%的欺骗检测准确率，并在无明确提示下成功诱导出40%的情境欺骗。

Conclusion: 揭示了思维链推理模型的诚实性问题，并提供了可信AI对齐的工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: 该模型首次在循环架构中成功应用可微分逻辑门网络，为局部化处理系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Motivation: 传统的自主系统多依赖外部奖励驱动，而在资源波动的环境中，系统需要自我调节以维持生存。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过基于能量的效用函数和生存时间边界约束，提出了一种模块化架构，整合能量采集、温度调节和自适应计算，形成闭环控制系统。

Result: 模拟环境中展示了系统在无外部监督下表现出稳定且资源敏感的行为。

Conclusion: 为资源不稳定的环境下的自主系统提供了理论和架构基础，强调自我维持能力的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Motivation: 传统无人机飞行控制依赖硬编码方程，而现有大型语言模型(LLMs)在数学推理和精确计算方面表现不足，需要一种更可靠的方法来支持无人机任务。

Method: 研究提出RAG-UAV框架，利用检索增强生成技术，为LLMs提供相关领域文献，并在自建的UAV-Math-Bench基准上进行测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，RAG显著提升了LLMs的准确率（最高达75%），降低了错误公式选择率（从25%降至5%），并大幅减少了数值误差（MSE下降多个数量级）。

Conclusion: 研究表明RAG能有效提升通用LLMs在工程分析中的可靠性，但实时飞行控制仍需进一步的大规模验证研究。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Motivation: 当前自改进智能体的方法缺乏灵活性，难以跨任务泛化且能力扩展受限，需要引入内禀元认知机制以实现持续、通用的自我改进。

Method: 借鉴人类元认知，提出了包含元认知知识、元认知规划和元认知评估三部分的形式化框架。

Result: 分析表明现有系统依赖外置元认知机制，而内禀元认知的要素已部分存在；探讨了人机元认知职责分配及评估方法。

Conclusion: 实现真正的持续自改进需解决内禀元认知学习的关键挑战，包括职责分配和鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索方法如MCTS依赖固定启发式参数，难以适应不同难度任务，需手动调整且计算成本高。

Method: LFS让LLM通过内部评分机制自主决定搜索路径，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略，实现灵活、上下文敏感的推理。

Result: LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，计算效率更高，且随模型增强而扩展性更好。

Conclusion: LFS通过LLM自主搜索设计，在挑战性任务中表现更优，无需额外调参，计算效率高且扩展性强。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

<details>

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型(LRMs)在简单问题上过度消耗计算资源的问题。

Method: 通过自适应长度惩罚(ALP)，根据每个提示的在线解决率动态调整生成长度的强化学习目标。

Result: 训练后，DeepScaleR-1.5B模型的平均token使用量减少了50%。

Conclusion: ALP智能地重新分配计算资源，在保持性能的同时提高困难问题的准确率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于统计模型的OOD检测方法缺乏可解释性，且在处理开放世界场景时可靠性不足。

Method: 提出将MLNs与现有OOD检测器结合，利用加权一阶逻辑约束进行概率推理，并设计算法从数据中学习逻辑约束。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，MLNs能显著提升现有OOD检测器性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MLNs为OOD检测提供了可解释的概率推理框架，有效增强了现有方法的可靠性与透明度。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型三重注意力Transformer架构，用于预测时间依赖性混凝土徐变。通过将混凝土徐变预测转化为类似于语言处理的自回归序列建模任务，该架构利用Transformer的自注意力机制捕捉历史徐变模式的长期依赖性，显著优于传统经验模型和现有机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅将时间作为输入参数，而忽视了形变发展的序列性质，这在混凝土徐变预测中存在根本性限制。本文旨在通过Transformer架构解决这一问题。

Method: 采用了三重注意力框架：时序注意力用于序列进展、特征注意力用于材料属性交互、批量注意力用于样本间关系，并通过自回归序列建模任务实现预测。

Result: 模型在160天的标准化每日测量数据集上表现优异，平均绝对百分比误差为1.63%，R2值为0.999，显著优于传统方法。SHAP分析表明弹性模量是最主要的预测特征。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了Transformer架构在材料科学问题中的可行性，展示了数据驱动方法在结构行为预测和工程设计实践中的革命性潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Result: 实验表明，MUC-G4能有效处理量化和剪枝，验证时间显著快于传统方法，且具有高证明重用率。

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全性与可靠性提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first

descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify

experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Conclusion: DrSR通过数据理解与生成反射的闭环整合，为科学方程发现提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Conclusion: PANN为星载资源受限环境下的数据处理提供了一种有前景的解决方案，能够有效识别自然灾害变化并优先传输关键数据，满足应急响应需求。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Conclusion: 通过利用预训练主干数据，BAT方法有效解决了适配数据不足的问题，ALBAT算法在实际任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer在权重内学习（IWL）和上下文学习（ICL）两种学习机制下处理传递性推理任务的能力，发现IWL能自然推广到传递性推理，而ICL仅适用于相邻项关系。但ICL模型在经过特定预训练后也能展现类似人类的推理特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在关系推理任务中表现出色，但不同学习机制下（权重内学习与上下文学习）其推理机制尚不明确。本文旨在探究这两种机制在经典传递性推理任务中的表现差异。

Method: 通过设计传递性推理任务（如A>B且B>C则A>C），对比IWL（信息存储在模型参数中）和ICL（从输入序列中灵活提取信息）两种学习机制的表现，并进行机理分析。同时研究了ICL模型在线性回归任务预训练后的推理能力变化。

Result: IWL模型即使仅训练相邻项关系也能自然推广到传递性推理，而ICL模型仅能通过匹配-复制策略处理相邻项关系。但经过结构化任务预训练后，ICL模型可表现出类似人类的符号距离和末端项效应特征，且无需形成归纳电路。

Conclusion: 研究表明：1）IWL天然具有传递性推理偏置；2）ICL的推理能力依赖任务结构；3）预训练的结构化任务能促进上下文关系推理所需的表征学习。为理解Transformer的推理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法成功实现理论突破，为物联网环境下的优化问题提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Result: 实验表明AutoCT在有限次自优化迭代后，性能达到或超过现有最优方法。

Conclusion: AutoCT为临床实验预测提供了可扩展、可解释且成本效益高的新范式。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出结合真实运营数据和模拟故障场景的深度学习框架，用于露天矿运输车队产能的短期预测，XGBoost和LSTM模型表现接近，整合模拟数据显著降低预测波动性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 露天矿运输车队产能受天气波动、机械故障及人员变动等不确定因素影响显著，需精准短期预测以优化运营。

Method: 融合高分辨率降雨数据、车队性能遥测等真实记录与合成故障场景数据，对比XGBoost回归器和LSTM网络，使用SHAP值分析关键预测因子。

Result: XGBoost中位数绝对误差14.3%，LSTM为15.1%；累积降雨量、历史载荷趋势及模拟故障频率为关键因子，模拟数据集成有效降低预测波动。

Conclusion: 该混合建模方法为动态不确定条件下的车队管理提供数据驱动决策支持，未来拟整合维保计划、人力资源等指标以增强模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种四步法，通过softlog-softmax级联提升下一代集成学习系统的一致性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成学习方法在复杂问题中缺乏一致性和可靠性，难以处理多样化的决策需求。

Method: 1. 解剖结构：构建基于卷积棱镜的多样化集成模型；2. 神经工程：设计softlog保证弱对数运算一致性并生成中间决策；3. 神经信息论：提出基于softlog的信息度量；4. 评估：推导性能张量进行可靠评估。

Result: 证明问题复杂度越高，集成多样性越有效；提出的信息度量能在闭区间产生一致值，并确定个体与子群决策的关系。

Conclusion: 四步法显著提升集成学习的健壮性，并通过新型信息度量和评估框架实现了可靠决策。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Method: 本文对多种AI代理设计和测试时扩展策略进行了系统级分析，量化了其资源使用、延迟行为、能源消耗和电力需求，并探究了不同设计选择对精度-成本权衡的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示，AI代理在提高计算量以改善精度的同时，存在收益迅速递减、延迟方差扩大以及基础设施成本不可持续的问题。

Conclusion: 研究指出AI代理工作流带来了深远的计算需求，预示着可持续性危机，呼吁在设计上进行范式转变，以实现计算效率与性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

TL;DR: RedRFT是一个轻量级基准工具，旨在简化和标准化基于强化微调（RFT）的红队测试方法，解决了当前方法缺乏统一基准和实现细节影响结果稳定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于强化微调（RFT）的红队测试方法缺乏统一基准，且实现细节（特别是基于PPO的方法）对结果稳定性和可复现性有显著影响，因此需要一种标准化工具来简化实现和评估过程。

Method: 提出RedRFT基准，结合CleanRL和Tianshou的设计优势，提供高质量的单文件实现和模块化PPO核心组件，支持多种多样性和内在奖励计算的度量指标。

Result: 通过关键组件（如LoRA、KL散度和Lagrange Multiplier）的广泛消融研究，澄清了它们对RFT性能的影响，并提供了快速原型开发的工具支持。

Conclusion: RedRFT有助于深入理解RFT红队测试的实现细节，并支持快速创新功能的原型开发，为相关研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

### [150] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为YOTO（You Only Train Once）的方法，通过一次性优化损失超参数和模型参数，减少了常规训练中的多次尝试需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练过程中需要多次尝试不同的架构设计和损失权重，YOTO旨在一次性完成这些优化，提高效率。

Method: YOTO通过梯度优化损失权重，并将其建模为网络参数，利用可微分的复合损失函数和Softmax参数化层来实现。

Result: YOTO在3D估计和语义分割任务上表现优于传统的网格搜索方法。

Conclusion: YOTO方法有效地减少了训练次数，并且在实际应用中表现出色，代码将会开源。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在减少神经网络中的可训练参数量，同时通过随机连接的规则化效应保持模型性能，以探索更高效的网络结构设计。

Method: 设计了“半单元”结构：先以固定随机权重对输入加权求和，再通过两个可训练权重进行缩放和平移，最后经过非线性激活。该结构可应用于网络任何层。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上实验表明，半层结构能以较少参数达到合理准确率，验证了随机连接的规则化效果。

Conclusion: 半层结构通过部分权重随机化显著减少了可训练参数数量，同时保持模型性能，为深度学习模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单一指标目标（如夏普比率）无法灵活反映多元化的投资者偏好。为此，作者设计了一种模块化、可参数化的复合奖励函数框架。

Method: 使用年化收益、下行风险、差异收益和特雷诺比率四个可微项构建复合奖励函数，通过网格搜索调整权重参数，并推导各项的闭式梯度以支持梯度训练。

Result: 该方法提供了奖励函数的理论性质分析（单调性、有界性和模块化），并证明其可作为复杂交易环境中多目标奖励设计的通用框架。

Conclusion: 该框架通过参数化权重编码风险收益偏好，支持扩展其他风险指标或自适应权重，为金融交易强化学习提供了灵活稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity
boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲空间中的决策树模型通常采用Lorentz模型，但该方法难以直接利用欧几里得空间的优化技术。作者旨在通过Beltrami-Klein模型实现与欧几里得决策树的兼容性。

Method: 将hyperDT算法重构为Beltrami-Klein模型下的预处理和后处理步骤，封装现有欧几里得空间树模型。

Result: 该方法提升了模型的灵活性、速度和准确性，同时代码更简单、易维护和扩展。

Conclusion: Beltrami-Klein模型下的hyperDT实现为双曲空间决策树提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: 持续学习研究中，样本回放技术虽广泛使用，但本文通过理论分析发现其效果并不总是理想，甚至可能有害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临的一个重要问题是遗忘，即在学习新任务时对旧任务的性能下降。样本回放是一种常用的缓解遗忘的技术，但其效果缺乏理论分析。

Method: 本文在过参数化的持续线性回归设定下，对样本回放进行了理论分析，探讨了回放样本的作用和任务子空间之间的关系。

Result: 研究发现，即使在无噪声环境下，遗忘现象并不总是随回放样本数量单调减少；在某些情况下，回放样本可能对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 样本回放的效果高度依赖于回放样本的选择和任务间的关系，即使在看似良性场景下也可能出现有害影响，这对持续学习研究提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

Motivation: 基于价值的强化学习中，移除目标网络可以更新估计并节省内存，但会导致性能下降。本文旨在找到目标网络与无目标网络方法之间的折衷方案。

Method: 提出iS-QL方法，仅复制在线网络的最后一层作为目标网络，其余参数共享，结合迭代Q学习来减小性能差距。

Result: iS-QL提高了无目标网络方法的样本效率，内存占用更小且训练时间与传统目标网络方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL通过创新设计，在保持目标网络优势的同时减少资源消耗，有望推动强化学习研究的扩展。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Result: 在2D点代理和连续控制基准测试中，UMCNP相比基线显著减少了适应新任务所需的样本量。

Conclusion: UMCNP展示了在无监督元测试下的高效适应能力，为元强化学习提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: 本研究建立了自监督与监督对比学习的理论桥梁，揭示了表征的优化几何特性，并提出的小样本误差界限为理解对比学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Conclusion: 为零阶优化在资源受限的LLM适配中提供了理论支持和实用方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统二阶优化方法因计算二阶梯度代价高昂，而一阶方法无法捕捉梯度间结构化不确定性。KOALA++旨在高效建模梯度协方差结构，避免昂贵矩阵运算。

Method: 通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差乘积来估计参数协方差矩阵，无需存储完整协方差矩阵或进行大矩阵求逆，扩展了原KOALA框架的对角协方差假设。

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模等任务中，KOALA++准确率媲美或超越当前最优一阶/二阶优化器，同时保持一阶方法的计算效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++在计算效率和模型性能间取得平衡，为梯度不确定性建模提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

TL;DR: 该研究发现了神经网络训练中的新阶段——反顿悟（anti-grokking），并证明HTSR指标α能有效区分训练的三个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索神经网络中已知的顿悟现象（grokking），并识别是否存在其他未被发现的训练阶段。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST的1k样本子集上训练，结合WeightWatcher工具的HTSR指标α进行分析。

Result: 发现反顿悟阶段，其特点是测试准确率崩溃但训练准确率保持完美，且α<2和相关性陷阱（Correlation Traps）是这一阶段的标志。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α能有效衡量过拟合和泛化崩溃，为神经网络的训练阶段提供了新的评估框架。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了RETRO SYNFLOW（RSF），一种基于离散流匹配框架的单步逆合成规划方法，通过反应中心识别和Feynman-Kac引导提升生成反应的多样性和可行性，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有机化学中的目标产物分子合成路径预测具有挑战性，现有方法在单步反应预测中难以同时保证准确性和多样性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用离散流匹配框架构建目标产物与反应物之间的马尔可夫桥，结合反应中心识别生成中间结构（合成子），并利用Feynman-Kac引导和序贯蒙特卡洛重采样优化生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，RSF在top-1准确率上达到60.0%，超出之前最佳方法20%。Feynman-Kac引导提升top-5往返准确率19%，同时保持竞争力的top-k准确率。

Conclusion: RETRO SYNFLOW通过创新的流匹配框架和引导机制，显著提升了单步逆合成的准确性和多样性，为有机合成路线规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出选择性匹配损失函数，通过设计分数域上的递增链接函数，优化模型在关键区域的预测准确度，并扩展到多分类场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多学习系统中，准确预测某些关键区域（高分区域）比其它区域更重要。传统损失函数无法区分区域重要性，导致模型在关键区域表现不佳。

Method: 设计基于Sigmoid和双曲正弦的链接函数构建选择性标量损失，并开发复合Softmax框架解决多分类中的排名敏感性问题。

Result: 选择性损失函数在停留时间预测、检索、排序等任务中显著优于传统损失，尤其在需要区分关键分数区域的应用中表现突出。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数通过明确区分高低重要性区域，有效提升模型在关键区域的预测性能，扩展了损失函数设计的灵活性。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的神经符号AI框架ODXU，用于网络入侵检测系统，结合深度聚类、符号推理和不确定性量化，提升了性能和可解释性。实验表明其在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上优于传统模型，并开发了迁移学习方法以适配新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）面临日益复杂的网络安全威胁，传统方法在鲁棒性、可解释性和泛化能力方面存在不足。本文旨在通过神经符号AI框架（ODXU）提升这些性能，并探索迁移学习在网络安全领域的潜力。

Method: 扩展的ODXU框架整合了深度嵌入聚类、XGBoost符号推理和综合不确定性量化（UQ）。采用了基于分数的方法（如置信度评分、香农熵）和基于元模型的技术（如SHAP值和信息增益）评估预测可靠性。同时，设计了迁移学习策略，实现预训练模型在新数据集上的复用。

Result: 在CIC-IDS-2017数据集上，ODXU在分类准确率和误报率等六个指标上优于传统神经模型。迁移学习实验显示，在ACI-IoT-2023数据集上，仅需16,000样本（约50%训练数据）即可超越传统方法。此外，基于元模型的UQ方法在两类数据集上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 改进后的ODXU框架有效提升了NIDS的性能和可靠性，扩展的不确定性量化技术提供了更全面的预测评估。迁移学习策略验证了预训练模型在网络安全领域的适用性，为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了机器学习模型中系统性的重要性，分析了现有基准和模型在行为系统性上的局限性，并提出了评估表示系统性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机在于指出当前机器学习和神经语言处理领域中，系统性（systematicity）的研究主要集中在行为层面，而忽视了表示层面的系统性。作者强调这种区别的重要性，并试图填补这一空白。

Method: 作者首先澄清了行为系统性和表示系统性的区别，然后在Hadley（1994）的分类基础上，分析了现有语言和视觉领域中关键基准对行为系统性的测试程度。进一步，作者还介绍了机制可解释性领域中评估表示系统性的方法。

Result: 论文指出当前大多数基准和模型更关注行为的系统性，而较少关注内在表示的系统性。作者还分析了经典系统性基准的局限性，并提出了如何更全面地评估系统性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁研究者重视表示系统性的评估，并提倡结合机制可解释性领域的工具来推动系统性研究的发展。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 该研究利用机器学习模型对牙科服务提供商进行分类，通过特征选择和模型比较，发现神经网络在20个特征下达到最高准确率94.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过机器学习优化牙科服务提供商的分类，帮助针对性地分配资源给服务不足的群体。

Method: 使用2018年数据集，包含24,300个实例和20个特征，采用信息增益、基尼指数和ANOVA进行特征排名，评估了12种机器学习模型。

Result: 神经网络模型在所有20个特征下表现最佳（准确率94.1%），梯度提升和随机森林紧随其后。治疗相关指标是区分提供商类型的关键特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合特征排序技术和先进机器学习算法可以有效分类牙科服务提供商，提升资源分配的效率。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

TL;DR: 论文提出正交化梯度方法（⊥Grad），在不损失模型精度的情况下提升了校准性，在噪声数据和长时训练中表现更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法（如SGD）可能导致模型预测过度自信，校准性较差。本文探讨通过梯度正交化改进模型校准性。

Method: 提出⊥Grad方法，在训练过程中对梯度进行正交化处理，兼容不同优化器并能与后校准技术（如温度缩放）结合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10（10%标记数据）上，⊥Grad保持与SGD相当的精度，但显著改善校准指标（如降低测试损失、减少softmax过度自信、提高预测熵）。在CIFAR-10C噪声数据和长时训练中表现更稳定。理论分析证明其在正齐次网络中的收敛性。

Conclusion: 梯度正交化是提升模型校准性的有效手段，具有计算开销低、适配性广的优点，其理论性质为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Motivation: 在资源受限情况下，如何高效选择大语言模型(LLM)的适应策略并预测其性能与成本，避免昂贵的实验。

Method: 引入统一预测框架COSMOS，结合嵌入增强的轻量代理模型预测微调性能，以及低样本缩放法则预测检索增强上下文学习。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，COSMOS平均降低92.72%计算成本(最高达98.71%)，同时保持高预测精度。

Conclusion: LLM适应结果的高效预测不仅可行，还能在保持性能标准的同时大幅减少部署计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构预测模型难以捕捉动态生物分子复合物的构象多样性，而冷冻电镜虽能成像结构异质性，但数据处理流程繁琐。需结合两者优势。

Method: CryoBoltz框架利用冷冻电镜密度图提供的全局/局部结构约束，引导预训练蛋白质结构预测模型的采样轨迹，生成符合实验数据的构象。

Conclusion: CryoBoltz弥合了计算预测与实验数据的鸿沟，为动态生物分子结构的解析提供了新范式。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Motivation: 物理储层计算由于黑盒特性无法进行反向传播，限制了其在深度神经网络中的应用。本文旨在通过新方法克服这一局限。

Method: 受物理学扰动理论启发，PGT通过参数空间的随机扰动仅使用前向传播近似梯度更新，应用于模拟神经网络架构和磁振子自激振荡环实验硬件。

Result: PGT在无法或不适合使用反向传播的场景下，性能与标准反向传播方法相当，验证了其可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: PGT为物理储层集成到更深层神经网络架构、显著提升AI训练能效开辟了新途径，具有重要研究价值和应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Conclusion: 多尺度隐式神经模拟器有效解决了长期预测中的误差累积问题，为复杂动态系统建模提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型(LLMs)依赖地理分布的加速器，导致跨区域通信成本高昂且硬件利用率不均。

Method: 采用分层设计，在每个区域设置局部参数服务器(LPS)和全局参数服务器(GPS)，利用分层动量和异步训练优化通信和计算效率。

Result: 实验显示HALoS比同步基线快7.5倍，优于现有异步方法2.1倍，同时保持或超越同步SGD的模型精度。

Conclusion: HALoS证明了分层更新聚合和全局模型合并是实现高效、可扩展LLM训练的有效方法。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的非平稳Merton跳跃扩散模型（Neural MJD），用于时间序列预测，通过显式建模随机微分方程和跳跃过程，提高了对非平稳数据的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法在黑盒性质和显式建模随机过程方面的不足，限制了其在非平稳数据（尤其是存在突变的情况下）上的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了Neural MJD模型，将预测问题公式化为随机微分方程模拟问题，结合时间非齐次的Itô扩散和时间非齐次的复合泊松过程来建模非平稳动态和突变。引入了似然截断机制和Euler-Maruyama重启求解器以提高学习效率和估计精度。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Neural MJD在预测性能上优于当前最先进的深度学习与统计学习方法。

Conclusion: Neural MJD通过显式建模非平稳随机过程和跳跃事件，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和稳健性。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习(FL)在大规模数据集和多设备参与时面临训练瓶颈和异构性问题，量子联邦学习(QFL)背景下这些问题更为突出。本文旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 引入模型驱动的量子联邦学习算法(mdQFL)，支持训练与更新个性化，并探索测试泛化能力。方法适应不同设备数量，在Qiskit环境中进行多样性非IID数据实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，mdQFL将总通信成本降低近50%，同时保持或提升最终模型精度，局部模型训练效果优于标准QFL基线。理论分析进一步阐明了算法的复杂性。

Conclusion: mdQFL算法有效解决了QFL中的关键挑战，显著降低了通信开销并提升了模型性能，为其他FL场景提供了可借鉴的解决方案。

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有差分隐私文本生成方法采用均匀随机采样构建推断批次，当敏感输入涉及异构主题时会导致生成质量下降。

Method: 1. 对输入数据进行聚类以构建推断批次 2. 利用预测标记相似性设计基于中值的隐私聚合算法 3. 提供数据依赖的差分隐私保证

Result: 该方法在MAUVE等代表性指标和下游任务表现上均有提升，能以更低隐私成本生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: 通过聚类预处理和中值聚合策略，该方法有效解决了异构主题下的差分隐私文本生成质量问题，性能优于现有最优方法。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对称化操作忽略了方向信息，导致信息丢失和误导性解释。为确保关键领域决策的可靠性，需改进GNN可解释性。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析方向语义保留对解释质量的影响。

Result: 保留方向语义显著提高了GNN的解释质量，为决策者提供更可信的洞察。

Conclusion: 在安全关键应用中，必须采用方向感知的GNN可解释性方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

Result: 双向边界显著稳定了训练过程，实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成

Conclusion: 双向边界是改善EBM训练的有效策略

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Motivation: 针对图神经网络(GNN)中普遍认为的过平滑问题限制了深层架构性能的观点，本文认为过平滑的影响被高估，呼吁重新探索深层GNN架构的潜力。

Method: 通过分析GNN三个核心操作(聚合、线性变换、非线性激活)，指出过平滑与梯度消失的混淆，并验证经典方法(跳跃连接、归一化)对深层GNN的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究澄清了关于过平滑的误解，为深层GNN的发展提供了新的理论依据和技术路径。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法通过结合标签关系的抗噪性和标签连通性，有效解决了PML中的维度诅咒问题，并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: FedAPM通过双阶邻近校正有效减轻客户端漂移，在保持模型个性化优势的同时，显著提升联邦学习的收敛性能与效率，优于现有最优方法。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了时间序列预测中集合学习的准确性与计算成本间的权衡，发现小型集合足以达成接近最优结果，并建议通过调整重训练频率和选择效率驱动集合来优化成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模和预测模型复杂度的增加，预测准确性与计算成本之间的权衡问题日益突出，尤其是在时间序列预测的集合学习背景下。

Method: 研究评估了两个大规模零售数据集（M5和VN1）上的十个基础模型和八种集合配置，考虑了不同重训练频率下的点预测和概率预测准确性。

Result: 集合方法持续提升预测性能，尤其在概率预测上效果显著，但这伴随较高的计算成本。降低重训练频率能大幅减少成本，而对准确性影响较小。小型集合（2-3个模型）常能达到接近最优效果。

Conclusion: 精心设计的集合和合理选择的重训练策略能实现既准确、稳健又经济的预测，适合实际应用，支持可持续AI在预测领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Urania框架成功实现了隐私保护与数据洞察的平衡，展示了强大的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DIPNet的新框架，通过将输入投影到可学习的分布中，以促进更平滑的损失曲面，从而提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着过参数化模型的普及，仅依靠训练损失难以有效评估泛化性能。现有研究表明平滑性与泛化性能相关，但在神经网络中直接实施平滑性仍有挑战。

Method: 介绍了一种名为DIPNet的框架，它在每一层将输入投影到可学习的分布中，通过分布表示诱导出更平滑的损失曲面。

Result: DIPNet在多种架构和任务中验证有效，包括ViTs、LLMs、ResNet和MLPs，在常规设定、对抗攻击、分布外输入和推理基准测试中均表现优异。

Conclusion: DIPNet是一种通用且有效的方法，能够无缝整合到现有模型中，显著提升现代深度学习中的泛化性能。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Motivation: 当前图影响函数方法依赖严格的凸性假设，仅考虑边删除的影响，忽视边插入及消息传播的变化，限制了GNNs的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了适用于GNNs的近端Bregman响应函数，放宽凸性要求，同时显式建模消息传播效应，支持边删除和插入的联合影响预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确预测不同类型GNNs中边修改的影响，并在图重连和对抗攻击等应用中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为GNNs边影响分析提供了更通用的理论框架和实用工具，提升了模型的解释性与抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升模型能力（如指令遵循、偏好学习和推理）方面取得显著成果，但其改善推理能力的具体机制尚未明晰。本研究旨在系统性探索RL在推理优化中的作用机制。

Method: 提出强化学习可验证奖励框架（RLVR），通过实验验证其优化推理模式选择的作用，并建立简化的问答模型进行梯度流理论分析，探究收敛动态。同时引入监督微调（SFT）预训练对比实验。

Result: RLVR主要优势在于筛选高成功率推理模式，且保持单模式性能稳定。理论分析显示：初始推理能力强的模型收敛快，弱模型收敛慢但可通过高质量SFT预训练缓解。实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 本研究从理论和实验层面揭示了RL优化推理的机制，提出SFT+RLVR的协同训练范式，为增强大语言模型推理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于卫星数据的机器学习框架，用于对孟加拉国38个地区的干旱进行分类，并成功将干旱严重程度分为不同等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统干旱指数如SPI和PDSI在孟加拉国的应用中忽略了土壤湿度和温度等重要因素且分辨率有限。此外，当前用于干旱预测的机器学习模型在孟加拉国的探索不足，且缺乏多地区卫星数据的综合集成。

Method: 采用了无监督算法（如K-means和贝叶斯高斯混合）进行聚类，随后使用分类模型（如KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯）并结合2012-2024年的天气数据（湿度、土壤湿度、温度）进行分类。

Result: 该框架成功地将干旱严重程度分为不同等级，并揭示了地区间的干旱脆弱性存在显著差异，表明了机器学习模型在识别和预测干旱状况方面的能力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合卫星数据和多种机器学习方法，为孟加拉国的干旱分类提供了一种有效的工具，并在区域干旱脆弱性分析方面取得了重要发现。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的无似然目标函数dual-ISL，用于训练隐式生成模型，具有凸优化、连续性和快速收敛等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于排名的统计度量（如ISL）在训练隐式生成模型时表现出鲁棒性和有效性，但存在一些局限性。本文旨在提出一种新的目标函数dual-ISL，以解决这些问题。

Method: 通过交换ISL框架中目标分布和模型分布的角色，构建了dual-ISL目标函数，并证明了其在模型密度空间中是凸优化问题。此外，还扩展了多元设置的分析。

Result: dual-ISL在多个基准测试中表现优于经典ISL和其他隐式生成方法，收敛更快、训练更稳定，且能有效防止模式坍塌。

Conclusion: dual-ISL不仅具有理论优势，还在实际应用中表现出色，为隐式生成模型训练提供了一种更有效的方法。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的强大和普及，如何高效地移除特定数据对模型的影响（如因隐私、法律或有害内容修正）变得尤为重要。传统方法需要高成本的重新训练，而本文旨在开发一种能选择性遗忘且保持模型质量的算法。

Method: 采用基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，通过梯度操作选择性移除目标数据的影响，避免从头训练。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在MNIST和CelebA数据集上比前代方法（如梯度手术）快数个数量级，并成功实现了数据遗忘与模型性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 本文算法能高效、可靠地实现生成模型的数据遗忘需求，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Motivation: 标准GRPO算法在缺乏中间监督时存在探索效率低下问题，单个错误会导致整个推理链失效，影响训练稳定性。

Method: 提出MGRPO：第一层用标准GRPO生成初始回答，第二层专门训练识别并修正初始回答中的错误，形成自我纠错循环。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，MGRPO显著优于标准GRPO，同时增强了模型的推理和自我纠错能力。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过隐式过程级监督机制有效改善GRPO的训练稳定性和推理性能。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的注意力机制虽强大，但其二次计算复杂度和线性内存消耗成为主要瓶颈。线性注意力和状态空间模型虽有线性效率，但隐藏状态固定大小的限制影响了其表现力。

Method: 提出log-linear attention，通过对数增长的隐藏状态替代固定大小状态，保留线性效率的同时提升表达力，并可适配现有线性注意力变体。

Result: 在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet架构上实例化该机制，性能优于原线性时间变体。

Conclusion: log-linear attention是通用框架，有效平衡效率与表达力，为序列建模提供新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Conclusion: OpenGT为未来图Transformer研究奠定了基础，强调公平性、可重复性和通用性，并提供了易于使用的库。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机线性bandit问题在重尾奖励下的上下界结果存在局限，特别是在维度依赖和有限矩条件下不够精确，迫切需要更优的算法和分析。

Method: 提出了一种基于实验设计的消除算法，针对有限和非有限动作集改进了现有的遗憾界限。

Result: 新算法实现了优于现有结果的遗憾界限，并对不同几何条件下的动作集进行了进一步优化，首次实现了在Matérn核下对所有ε∈(0,1]的次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了重尾线性bandit问题的最优遗憾界限，还展示了在某些几何条件下可以进一步优化维度依赖，为相关领域提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Result: 在核函数特征映射的温和假设下，证明了KDE-QUBO是k-medoids-QUBO的特例。

Conclusion: 揭示了两种VQ方法的结构性关联，为QUBO权重参数的几何解释提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: 研究发现Adam优化器导致训练中损失突增的机制，与自适应预条件自身有关，而非传统认为的损失景观特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练神经网络时使用Adam优化器常出现损失突增现象，已有解释归因于损失景观特性，但本文探讨Adam自适应预条件自身可能是触发突增的原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，考察梯度和二阶矩估计的关系，识别出导致预条件Hessian最大特征值超过稳定阈值的临界状态。

Result: 实验表明，当梯度和最大特征方向对齐且曲率超过阈值时，损失突增发生，这一机制在不同网络结构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预条件机制本身可能导致训练不稳定，提出了对损失突增现象的新解释。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过强化学习在逻辑谜题上微调大语言模型，以提升其结构化推理能力，实验表明该方法能增强模型的多步推理和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在监督任务上表现优秀，但在陌生环境中的结构化推理能力不足，传统微调方法可能仅培养领域特定的启发式策略而非通用思维。

Method: 研究者设计了七种定制逻辑谜题，通过强化学习（基于谜题正确性的二元反馈）微调模型，旨在培养约束传播、空间一致性等推理技能。

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型在数学基准测试中的分布外表现，尤其是需要多步推理的中等难度问题，但对机械记忆或高度专业化的任务改进有限。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑谜题的强化学习能重塑大语言模型的内部推理机制，促使其形成可迁移的推理模式，实现更稳健的复合泛化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的混合模型有效地克服了传统方法的局限性，并在多个应用中展现出优越性能，为稀疏表示学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

TL;DR: 本文指出，对比损失在多模态表示学习中存在模态特异性信息问题，并提出一种正则化项以提高表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比损失在多模态表示学习中无法有效学习对齐的表示空间，主要原因是表示空间中存在模态特异性信息。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过信息瓶颈原则分析问题，提出一种基于变分近似的正则化项，以增强表示对齐。

Result: 实验证明，加入正则化项后，表示对齐性显著提升，并在实际应用中展现出优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出的正则化项有效解决了多模态表示学习中的模态特异性信息问题，提升了表示的对齐性。

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过信息瓶颈目标改进概念瓶颈模型，确保每个表示组件仅保留相关概念信息，增强解释性和干预有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的表示通常难以解释，尤其在敏感应用中可能存在问题。概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然通过预测预定义概念来提升可解释性，但其表示组件可能包含不相关信息，影响干预效果和模型解释性。

Method: 引入最小概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过变分正则化项在训练损失中加入信息瓶颈目标，约束每个表示组件仅保留与对应概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs能够支持具有理论保证的概念级干预，符合贝叶斯原则，并在关键设计选择上提供更大灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs通过信息瓶颈约束改进了概念瓶颈模型，提供了更高的解释性和干预有效性，适合敏感应用场景。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是骨关节炎的风险因素，早期诊断可为手术干预提供机会。现有角度测量方法效率低且依赖二维扫描解读。

Method: 结合高斯过程隐变量模型和微分同胚构建统计形状模型(GPDSSM)，使用192例CT扫描数据(100训练/92测试)进行验证。

Result: GPDSSM模型分类AUC达96.2%，优于传统角度测量方法(91.2%)，能自动识别异常解剖区域，显著减少临床医师工作量。

Conclusion: GPDSSM为髋关节发育不良提供了更准确高效的诊断工具，既可改善分类性能又能节约临床时间。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: 早期识别ICU高危患者对分配有限医疗资源至关重要，需一种能结合多层语义特征并保持精确度与召回平衡的模型。

Method: 提出ALFIA，结合LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，在cw-24基准上训练，融合BERT主干的多层语义特征。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Motivation: 工业4.0引入了复杂性，而Agentic AI系统的发展为工业自动化提供了新可能，通过整合意图驱动的范式与Agentic AI，可以简化人机交互，更好地实现工业5.0的人本、可持续和弹性原则。

Method: 研究提出了一个概念框架，结合意图处理范式，将人类操作者的高级业务或运营目标分解为可操作的组件，并通过配备专业工具的子代理执行领域特定任务，使用CMAPSS数据集和Google Agent Developer Kit进行了概念验证。

Result: 概念验证展示了意图分解、代理编排和自主决策在预测性维护场景中的可行性，证实了该方法在降低技术障碍和实现可扩展、意图驱动自动化方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管存在数据质量和可解释性问题，该框架展示了Agentic AI在工业自动化中的潜力，特别是在意图驱动的场景下，为实现工业5.0的目标提供了新途径。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理时计算和能耗高，传统量化方法因异常值导致性能下降，需开发不影响模型功能的高效量化方案。

Method: 设计四种可合并的变换：查询/键预RoPE变换、值变换、MLP缩放变换及动态缩放变换，通过局部/端到端训练优化激活分布。

Result: 静态INT4量化实现SOTA加速(3.9倍)，精度与多数现有工作相当，仅比慢29%的方法略低。

Conclusion: FPTQuant以近零推理开销实现高效量化，在精度-速度权衡上表现卓越，无需定制内核。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Motivation: 现有的无悔学习算法在学习速度上存在局限，特别是在非单调步长条件下表现不佳。本文旨在探索一种无需依赖单调步长、能自适应加速学习的方法。

Method: 引入'谨慎乐观'框架，以任何Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)实例为输入，通过最小计算开销调整学习节奏，输出加速后的无悔学习算法。

Result: 该方法在自对弈场景中实现了近乎最优的O(log T)遗憾，同时在对抗环境中保持O(√T)最优遗憾，且无需知道其他玩家的效用。

Conclusion: 该研究为一般游戏中的快速学习提供了一条新路径，证明了自适应学习节奏的有效性，且不依赖于单调步长假设。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: MPP编码作为一种通用且高效的向量模式地理空间数据编码方法，显著提升了机器学习和人工智能模型的地理空间特征参数化能力。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Result: 实验表明：1)基础模型带来显著性能提升 2)不同方法性能趋同 3)模型对标签模糊度保持稳健 4)性能受基础模型选择和适配策略影响明显。

Conclusion: 当前PLL方法存在局限性，基于CLIP的文本嵌入初始化和标签过滤策略有效，研究为开发泛化性更强的PLL模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过类间特征归因的新视角研究对抗训练（AT），发现共享多类的交叉类特征对鲁棒性至关重要，并提出AT初期学习更多交叉类特征及后续转向类特定特征的动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练虽被认为是增强深度神经网络对抗攻击鲁棒性的有效方法，但其训练机制和动态仍不完全明确。本文旨在通过类间特征归因的视角深入理解AT的运作机理。

Method: 作者提出通过交叉类特征（多类共享特征）的研究框架，结合理论分析和合成数据模型验证其稳健分类作用，并在多种模型架构和设置下进行系统性实验。

Result: 研究发现AT初期模型倾向于学习更多交叉类特征直至鲁棒性峰值；而随着训练继续导致鲁棒过拟合时，模型决策更依赖类特定特征。此发现统一解释了软标签训练优势和鲁棒过拟合现象。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AT机制中交叉类特征与类特定特征的动态作用，深化了对AT的理解，并为未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TIMING方法改进集成梯度(IG)，通过纳入时间感知解决时间序列可解释性问题，并设计新评估指标CPD/CPP。实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列可解释方法仅关注点级归因而忽略方向性影响，且传统评估指标会抵消相反特征贡献，导致关键点识别不足。

Method: 1) 提出CPD/CPP新评估指标；2) 改进IG为TIMING方法，加入时间关联并避免分布外样本。

Result: 在合成和真实时间序列数据上，TIMING优于现有基线方法，且传统IG在新指标下表现优于近期方法。

Conclusion: TIMING通过时间感知增强的IG能有效识别时间序列中正负向关键点，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为iN2V的方法，用于将传统的转导式节点嵌入（如node2vec）扩展到归纳式设置，从而能够处理训练期间未见的新节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的节点嵌入方法（如node2vec）仅适用于转导式设置，即必须在训练时已知所有节点（包括测试节点）。这在现实场景中限制了其应用，因为新节点可能不断出现。

Method: iN2V通过改进原始N2V的训练过程并结合后处理步骤，使模型能够为未见节点生成嵌入。这种方法是插件式的，可与其他嵌入方法结合使用。

Result: 实验表明，iN2V在多个基准数据集上平均提高了节点分类性能1个百分点，部分情况下提升可达6个百分点。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种灵活且有效的归纳式节点表示学习方法，能够扩展传统嵌入方法的应用范围，同时提升分类性能。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据分布随时间变化，模型在动态环境中需要重新训练。然而，如何在无标签情况下确定何时重新训练仍是一个挑战，因为并非所有数据变化都会导致模型性能下降。

Method: 论文提出了D3M算法，基于预测模型之间的分歧，实现低误报率，并提供样本复杂度边界以确保在高风险条件下有高真阳性率。

Result: 在标准基准测试和真实世界的大规模内科数据集上的实验表明，D3M框架有效，可作为高风险机器学习流程的预警机制。

Conclusion: D3M算法在监测模型部署后性能下降方面表现出色，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Motivation: 神经网络虽强大但难解释，线性模型直观但表达能力有限，需结合两者优势。

Method: 基于轮廓似然的优化算法，用神经网络学习线性预测的非线性修正，同时保持线性系数可解释性。

Result: 实验表明能恢复真实线性系数并显著提高预测准确性，在回归和分类任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: NIMO是唯一保持与线性模型同等可解释性的混合方法，且预测性能更佳。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: 扩展HiPPO框架以处理带噪声数据，提出一种不确定性感知的状态空间模型初始化方法，提升模型对噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际应用中数据往往存在噪声，这限制了模型性能。因此，需要一种能处理噪声的初始化方法。

Method: 将HiPPO重新解释为线性随机控制问题，数据作为噪声观测，通过推导后验推断初始化状态空间模型的动态。

Result: 实验表明，新初始化方法在训练和推理时均提高了模型对噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 提出的不确定性感知初始化方法有效解决了HiPPO在噪声数据下的局限性，提升了状态空间模型的实用性。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半隐变分推断方法（如KSIVI）在高维训练中仍存在方差大、偏差高和计算成本高的问题，需要更稳定的训练方案。

Method: 提出核化KL散度估计器进行非参数平滑，结合重要性采样校正降低偏差，并通过理论分析连接Stein变分梯度下降。

Result: 该方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配现有SIVI方法，梯度方差更低，函数空间偏差更小。

Conclusion: 通过核平滑与偏差校正的半隐框架，实现了高维后验逼近的稳定高效优化。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Motivation: 当前对合成数据隐私放大的理论研究不足，需要通过线性回归框架深入探讨隐私保护效果。

Method: 通过线性回归框架分析不同输入条件（可控与随机）对合成数据隐私保护的影响。

Result: 发现可控输入会导致隐私泄露，而随机输入能在一定数据量下增强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来更广泛隐私边界的理论基础，特别在线性回归领域有重要启示。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and

Conclusion: 揭示了生成和记忆在噪声变化时的定性转换特征，为深度模型理论理解提供新视角。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Motivation: 现有基于完整轨迹的奖励方法在优化推理过程的中间步骤时指导不足，需要一种能提供细粒度奖励信号的新方法。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过密集奖励信号显著提升了LLMs的学习效率和性能，证实了其有效性和高效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: LPMT通过长期热力学转移过程有效保持了局部特性并实现了精确的流形距离测量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Conclusion: 论文的结论揭示了Transformer如何同时学习通用表征并动态适应上下文示例，为理解其上下文学习能力提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Conclusion: 论文提出的HAR对比损失方法及其SHARP框架有效缓解了图神经网络中的度偏差问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: 提出的算法不仅增强了鲁棒性，还确保了良好的收敛行为，明确反映了去中心化、样本选择、算法鲁棒性和收敛性之间的内在联系。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

TL;DR: 论文提出统一框架理论保障KernelSHAP等估计器性能，并通过实验验证其有效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值是解释机器学习模型决策特征的重要工具，但精确计算复杂度高。现有随机估计器如KernelSHAP缺乏理论保障，需建立统一框架并填补理论空白。

Method: 构建包含KernelSHAP及相关估计器的统一框架，分析有/无放回抽样策略；证明非渐近理论保证；改进实现以支持高维数据。

Result: 在中小维度数据集上验证了低误差率，并在MNIST/CIFAR10等数据上优于原KernelSHAP库，实现高可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次为KernelSHAP提供理论支撑，揭示了估计器间的权衡关系，并通过实验证实其实际应用优势。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Diagonal Batching方法解决RMTs顺序执行瓶颈，实现并行化加速推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer因二次时间/线性内存复杂度难以处理长上下文，RMTs虽降低计算开销但引入顺序执行瓶颈

Method: 通过跨段并行调度方案Diagonal Batching，在保持精确循环的前提下消除顺序约束

Result: 在131k token序列上，比全注意力LLaMA-1B快3.3倍，比顺序RMT快1.8倍

Conclusion: 该技术无需重新训练即可降低推理成本，使RMTs成为长上下文场景的实用解决方案

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PTSD的新方法，通过结合并行回火和扩散模型，显著提升了神经采样器的效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经采样器在采样效率上仍不及最先进的MCMC方法并行回火（PT），且PT生成的样本存在依赖性问题，重复计算成本高。为此，作者旨在结合两者的优势，提出一种更高效的采样方法。

Method: 提出渐进回火扩散采样器（PTSD），通过在不同温度下顺序训练扩散模型，利用PT的优势提升神经采样器训练；并引入新方法将高温扩散模型生成的样本优化为低温近似样本，再用MCMC微调以训练下一个扩散模型。

Result: PTSD能够高效复用跨温度层级的样本信息，生成混合良好且无关联的样本，显著提升了目标评估效率，优于现有的基于扩散的神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD方法结合了PT和扩散模型的优势，在采样效率和样本质量上实现了显著提升，为神经采样器的设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Motivation: 现有Transformer虽主流但内存和计算成本高，而近年来线性化softmax的RNN模型(如Mamba)虽效率高但仍有优化空间。本文旨在结合两者优势，提出更优的RNN方案。

Method: 改进Mesa层：1) 数值稳定化；2) 支持分块并行；3) 采用共轭梯度法实时优化上下文回归目标。在十亿参数规模进行语言建模验证。

Result: 实验显示：1) 语言模型困惑度低于现有RNN；2) 下游任务(尤其是长上下文理解)性能更优；3) 代价是推理时FLOPs增加20-40%

Conclusion: 通过神经网络内部的序列优化计算换取性能提升，与当前'增加推理时计算'的研究趋势相呼应，为高效序列建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Motivation: 当前浅层稀疏自编码器（SAEs）依赖于准正交性假设，限制了提取相关特征的能力。论文旨在突破这一限制，特别是在如手写数字生成等分层场景中。

Method: 论文引入了多迭代稀疏自编码器（MP-SAE），通过展开匹配追踪（Matching Pursuit）实现残差引导的相关特征提取，同时保证随着原子选择增加，重建效果单调提升。

Result: 实验表明，MP-SAE能够有效提取相关特征，并在MNIST数据集上展示了其优于传统SAEs的性能。

Conclusion: MP-SAE作为一种新方法，克服了现有稀疏自编码器的局限性，为处理分层结构数据提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Conclusion: 通过理论和实验验证，提出的框架为潜在空间对齐开辟了一条新途径，提供了高效且计算成本低的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在各领域表现优异，但其训练动态的理论基础尚不完善。现有研究多聚焦于孤立组件，缺乏对组件间相互依赖关系的深入分析，尤其是引入残差连接后的影响。

Method: 通过分析包含自注意力、前馈网络和残差连接的单层完整Transformer结构，在适当初始化条件下研究梯度下降的收敛行为，并扩展到多层架构。

Result: 理论证明梯度下降具有线性收敛率，收敛速度由注意力层输出矩阵的奇异值决定；残差连接能改善softmax导致的低秩矩阵病态问题，提升优化稳定性。实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 残差连接通过缓解注意力层输出矩阵的病态性促进训练稳定性，为Transformer的理论分析提供了新的见解，并验证了多层级架构下的线性收敛率。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Conclusion: 结论是解决了Attias等人提出的开放问题，扩展了对有改进学习的理解。

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Motivation: 深度状态空间模型（SSMs）重新激发了基于物理的计算范式，但需要遵循核心物理原理的专用学习算法。

Method: 提出了循环哈密顿回波学习算法（RHEL），通过无耗散哈密顿系统的物理轨迹计算损失梯度，无需显式雅可比计算，且计算效率高。

Result: RHEL 在多种时间序列任务（序列长度达5万）中表现与BPTT相当，同时具备计算效率和物理可解释性。

Conclusion: RHEL为设计可扩展、高能效的物理自学习系统开辟了新途径，适用于序列建模任务。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Conclusion: 本研究通过紧致分析，为EF和EF^21方法提供了理论基础，方便算法间的公平对比。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Result: 实验显示，性能提升2.5倍，训练速度提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley在保证理论可靠性的同时，显著提升了计算效率和实用性。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆(BC)方法只能模仿专家在特定状态下的行为，当智能体偏离专家示范时无法自主恢复。需要让智能体具备独立推理能力以应对未见状态。

Method: 提出SAILOR框架，学习专家演示中的规划组件：1)世界模型 2)奖励模型，组合实现无需人工干预的稳定恢复行为学习。

Result: 在12个视觉操作任务上，SAILOR显著优于当前最好的扩散策略方法，即使BC增加5-10倍数据仍保持优势，且能识别细微错误并抗奖励攻击。

Conclusion: 学习规划组件的方法比单纯模仿更鲁棒，使智能体具备错误恢复能力，实验验证了SAILOR在复杂任务中的优越性。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is

### [245] [Sample Complexity and Representation Ability of Test-time Scaling Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05295)
*Baihe Huang,Shanda Li,Tianhao Wu,Yiming Yang,Ameet Talwalkar,Kannan Ramchandran,Michael I. Jordan,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了不同测试时策略的样本效率，理论分析了自一致性、最佳选择和自校正等方法，并验证了自校正方法的实践效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然测试时扩展范显著提升了大语言模型在复杂任务上的表现，但对不同策略样本效率的理论理解仍有限。

Method: 论文首先比较了自一致性与最佳选择两种重复采样策略的样本需求，随后研究了带验证反馈的自校正方法在Transformer中的表达能力。

Result: 自校正方法能让Transformer在测试时模拟专家池的在线学习，拓展了其在多任务环境中的表现能力。

Conclusion: 自校正方法在理论上和实践上都展现出了其在多任务处理中的实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SiftAttention方法，通过动态阈值过滤注意力分数，减少GPU内存带宽使用，同时保持模型质量优于现有近似注意力方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU上大语言模型推理效率受限于内存带宽，特别是在HBM与SRAM间数据传输时。现有近似注意力方法依赖高开销的top-k操作，在GPU上性能不佳。

Method: SiftAttention用基于阈值的元素级过滤替换top-k步骤，动态估计每步生成的阈值，仅加载和使用高于阈值的注意力分数及对应值向量。

Result: 评估显示SiftAttention在减少值向量加载内存带宽使用的同时，比现有近似注意力方法更好地保持模型质量。

Conclusion: SiftAttention通过高效动态阈值机制优化注意力计算，平衡了GPU内存带宽使用与模型质量。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth,Zahra Kadkhodaie,Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的能量模型学习框架，通过修改得分网络架构并利用去噪目标优化，成功在ImageNet64数据集上实现了与最先进模型相当的性能，并验证了模型的强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习数据中的概率模型是机器学习的核心任务之一，但由于维度诅咒的挑战，这一任务变得极为困难。论文旨在通过受扩散生成模型启发的框架，解决这一问题。

Method: 修改了一个得分网络架构来计算能量，同时保留其归纳偏置。通过去噪目标优化能量网络的梯度，并利用一个新颖的二次目标确保跨噪声水平的能量一致性和归一化。

Result: 在ImageNet64数据集上训练的能量模型实现了与最先进模型相当的交叉熵值，并且显示出强泛化能力，估计的对数概率几乎独立于训练集中的特定图像。

Conclusion: 研究表明，图像概率和局部邻域的维度随图像内容显著变化，这与传统的测量浓度或支持低维流形的假设形成对比。

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法提升大语言模型（LLM）强化学习微调的数据效率：基于自适应难度的在线数据选择和回放机制，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL微调LLM资源消耗大且忽视数据效率问题，亟需优化方法降低计算成本。

Method: 1. 自适应难度框架筛选中等难度问题；2. 注意力机制估算问题难度；3. 回放近期数据减少重复计算。

Result: 在6种LLM-数据集组合实验中，方法将微调时间减少25%-65%（达到GRPO同等性能）。

Conclusion: 数据效率优化技术显著加速RL微调，为资源密集型LLM训练提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: LSM-2 with AIM是一种新型自监督学习方法，能从缺失数据中学习鲁棒表示，无需显式填补，适用于穿戴设备数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型通常依赖完整数据，但穿戴设备数据常存在严重缺失，传统自监督学习方法难以处理。

Method: 采用自适应继承掩码（AIM）技术，通过可学习的掩码令牌建模真实缺失和人为引入缺失，直接从缺失数据中学习。

Result: 在4000万小时多模态传感器数据上预训练的LSM-2，在分类、回归和生成任务中表现最佳，且对临床相关缺失模式保持高性能。

Conclusion: AIM是穿戴设备数据应用的可靠选择，能有效处理真实世界中的碎片化数据。

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

*Yingshuai Ji,Haomin Zhuang,Matthew Toole,James McKenzie,Xiaolong Liu,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AI的两步学习框架，用于从多散射QPI图像中提取单散射核，相比传统方法显著提升了解析精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准粒子干涉成像（QPI）是研究量子材料电子结构的有力工具，但从多散射图像中提取单散射QPI模式（即散射核）一直是一个病态逆问题，传统方法难以解决。

Method: 该方法采用两步学习策略：第一步用变分自编码器学习散射核的紧凑潜在空间表示；第二步通过专用编码器将QPI观测数据与预学习核的潜在表示对齐，实现了复杂散射条件下的稳健推断。

Result: 在包含100种独特散射核的数据集上验证表明，该方法相比直接一步学习基线模型显著提高了提取精度（尤其对未见过的散射核具有更好泛化性）。

Conclusion: 该AI框架首次实现了QPI核的高精度提取，为量子材料电子结构研究提供了新工具，两步学习策略的设计对解决类似逆问题具有普适意义。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过实践效率视角重新审视了测试时的扩展规律，发现小模型的效果被显著高估，并提出了一种新的动力学扩展定律（Kinetics Scaling Law），通过稀疏注意力机制优化资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的基于计算最优性的研究忽略了推理策略（如Best-of-N、长链推理）引入的内存访问瓶颈。论文旨在从实践效率的角度重新评估测试时的扩展规律，并提出更有效的资源分配方案。

Method: 论文通过分析0.6B到32B参数的模型，提出了一种新的动力学扩展定律，结合计算和内存访问成本。此外，提出了一种基于稀疏注意力的新扩展范例，以减少每个标记的成本，并在相同资源预算下实现更长的生成和更多并行样本。

Result: 实验表明，稀疏注意力模型在低成本和高成本场景下均优于密集模型，如在AIME问题解决准确率上分别获得超过60个点和5个点的提升。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键，不同于训练时参数扩展的饱和，测试时准确率通过增加的生成继续提升。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了动态内存稀疏化（DMS）方法，通过压缩Transformer LLMs中的键值缓存（KV cache）来提升推理效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer大模型的推理成本主要受限于键值缓存的大小，而非生成的令牌数量。因此，研究如何在相同计算预算下生成更多令牌、提高推理精度，成为关键挑战。

Method: 引入动态内存稀疏化（DMS），通过延迟令牌驱逐和隐式合并表示来压缩KV缓存，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，同时保持优于无训练稀疏注意力的精度。

Result: 在多个LLM模型家族上验证了DMS的有效性，例如Qwen-R1 32B在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench等任务上平均提升7.6至9.6个性能点。

Conclusion: DMS实现了一种实用的推理时超缩放技术，在相同计算开销下显著提升模型精度，为大模型高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“嫁接”的方法，通过修改预训练的扩散变换器（DiTs）来研究新架构设计，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计模型架构需要选择和配置多种操作符，但评估这些选择对模型质量的影响通常需要昂贵的预训练，这限制了架构研究的效率。受新软件开发基于现有代码的启发，研究者探索能否利用预训练模型研究新架构设计。

Method: 论文提出了“嫁接”这一方法，通过分析激活行为和注意力局部性构建测试平台，对预训练的扩散变换器进行编辑，实现新架构设计。具体包括替换softmax注意力为门控卷积、局部注意力和线性注意力，以及替换MLP为可变扩展比和卷积变体。

Result: 实验表明，许多混合设计在仅用不到2%的预训练计算资源的情况下，能达到良好的质量（FID：2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27）。文本到图像模型的速度提升了1.43倍，且质量下降不到2%。通过将两个连续的Transformer块转换为并行块，模型深度减半且质量优于同类模型（FID：2.77）。

Conclusion: 研究证明，通过嫁接预训练的扩散变换器，可以高效探索新的扩散模型设计，操作包括操作符替换和架构重组。这一方法显著降低了研究新架构所需的计算成本。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

Motivation: 探讨现有公开工具是否满足实践者评估大语言模型代表伤害的需求，并识别阻碍使用的关键挑战。

Method: 通过对12名实践者进行半结构化访谈，结合测量理论和实用测量方法分析问题。

Result: 发现工具存在两大问题：测量目标与实践需求不符，及实际使用中存在机构和操作障碍。

Conclusion: 建议改进测量工具以更贴合实践者需求，并消除使用障碍以提升工具实用性。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

Motivation: 探讨代理AI系统对公共部门传统监管机制的冲击，现有机制依赖孤立的合规单位和阶段性审批，无法满足持续集成监管需求。

Method: 采用混合方法：文献综述+AI相关公务员访谈，评估现有监管结构应对能力。

Result: 发现代理监管放大了三个现存治理挑战：持续监管、治理与运营能力深度整合、跨部门协作。提出五维治理框架。

Conclusion: 需调整制度结构并设计符合公共部门约束的代理监管方案，以应对AI带来的强化版治理挑战。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有对AI生成内容给予第一修正案保护的假设，论证此类保护缺乏法律依据且不符合言论自由的核心理念。

Method: 通过分析AI模型缺乏意向性的特性，结合法律先例对‘言论’的定义进行法理论证。

Result: AI输出不构成法律认可的言论，用户亦无权主张接收AI内容的第一修正案权利；此类保护将妨碍政府监管并加剧错误信息传播。

Conclusion: 不应将第一修正案权利延伸至AI模型，以确保社会能有效监管这项技术并规避潜在危害。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，而现有的自动程序修复（APR）技术在漏洞修补这一安全关键领域尚未充分探索。因此，研究预训练语言模型在漏洞修补中的潜力具有重要意义。

Method: 研究使用CodeBERT和CodeT5预训练语言模型，在六个数据集和四种编程语言上进行自动漏洞修补实验，评估其准确性和对未知漏洞的泛化能力。

Result: 结果表明，CodeBERT在上下文碎片化或稀疏的情况下表现更好，而CodeT5在捕捉复杂漏洞模式和可扩展性方面表现更优。微调模型在分布内数据上表现提升，但在分布外数据上泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究为自动漏洞修补提供了性能基准，指出了泛化能力的局限性，并提出了推动该领域发展的实际建议。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Conclusion: CoRAL框架在自动化代码审查评论生成方面表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Motivation: 研究目的是解决从水分测量数据中准确估计土壤特性的参数识别问题，特别是在不同数据条件下的表现。

Method: 使用Fokas方法生成的模拟数据，比较不同机器学习模型在完整、噪声和有限数据条件下的性能。

Result: 支持向量机（SVMs）和神经网络（NNs）表现出最高的鲁棒性，几乎完美预测扩散性，而导水性的预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 在多种数据条件下，支持向量机和神经网络是预测土壤特性的最优模型，扩散性的预测准确性高于导水性。

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Motivation: 探索光学物理中的非线性方程如何为生成式AI提供新的理论基础和方法论，实现物理自组织与人工智能的深度融合。

Method: 分析六个核心光学方程（线性/非线性），构建非线性Helmholtz、立方-五次耗散波、强度依赖Eikonal模型，实验验证生成性能与计算效率。

Result: 非线性模型显著优于线性版本：FID分数提升（0.0089 vs 1.0909），内存降低40-60%，训练加速30-50%，折射率重构精度达95%。

Conclusion: 揭示了物理自组织与AI的深刻联系，为高效光学计算和双向跨学科研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Motivation: 传统基于预定义噪声表的上色方法会损害感知一致性，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，提出SSIMBaD框架进行Sigma空间的线性变换对齐感知退化。

Result: 在大规模动漫脸谱数据集上实现了像素精度和感知质量的双重突破，并能泛化到多样风格。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD框架在保留结构保真度的同时，显著提升了动漫脸谱自动上色的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Conclusion: 瑞利商目标函数、Gram-Schmidt过程与神经网络离散化的结合为解决连续特征值问题提供了独特优势。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱占全球GDP的2%-5%，拆分交易（smurfing）是主要手法之一。现有网络嵌入方法多为黑箱模型，阻碍了商业应用。

Method: 利用二阶交易网络结构和节点邻域分数，结合树模型，生成可解释的风险指标GARG-AML。

Result: 在合成和开源网络上验证，GARG-AML性能优于当前最先进的拆分交易检测方法。

Conclusion: 基础网络特征和邻接矩阵可有效提升欺诈检测潜力，GARG-AML平衡了效率、准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a

The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures

address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 算法在并行有限阶段MDP中实现了成本效率与性能的突破，为高成本场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Conclusion: 分布编码（DE）方法有效解决了分类变量在高斯过程中的处理问题，并与离散和混合空间的贝叶斯优化最新进展形成天然互补。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

Motivation: 现有因果推断方法多局限于标量随机变量，而许多重要领域（如神经科学、心理学、社会科学等）的因果单元是变量组。因此需要扩展方法以处理向量形式的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1)推断随机向量间的因果顺序；2)在该顺序下选择最佳因果图。并为向量情况设计了新颖高效的解决方案。

Result: 模拟实验表明该方法性能优越，并在已知部分因果顺序的工业装配线实际数据中得到应用验证。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将因果关系推断扩展到向量变量，为解决多领域复杂系统的因果发现问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and

Motivation: 探讨在最佳臂识别问题中，适应性试验设计是否应被优先考虑，以更有效地分配测量资源，提高识别最有效治疗臂的置信度。

Method: 采用分批逐步淘汰低效臂适应性设计，量化了设计的统计效率，并分析其在大样本实验时的优势。

Result: 发现当处理三个及以上治疗臂时，简单适应性设计在统计效率上严格优于非适应性完全随机试验。

Conclusion: 适应性设计在最佳臂识别问题中具有明显优势，特别是处理多臂问题时，这解决了Qin[2022]提出的第二个开放性问题。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: 提出FlashDMoE方法，解决MoE模型GPU利用率低、延迟高等问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE模型存在GPU利用率低、延迟高和无法利用任务局部性的问题，主要原因是CPU管理的调度、主机发起的通信和频繁的内核启动。

Method: 开发FlashDMoE，一个完全驻留GPU的MoE操作符，将专家计算和GPU间通信融合为单个持久GPU内核，实现细粒度流水线。

Result: 在8个H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了延迟降低6倍，吞吐量提升5.7倍，GPU利用率提高了9倍。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE表明，基于原则的GPU内核-硬件协同设计是解锁大规模分布式ML工作负载性能上限的关键。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token

### [274] [Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235)
*Xinyan Zhao,Yi-Ching Tang,Akshita Singh,Victor J Cantu,KwanHo An,Junseok Lee,Adam E Stogsdill,Ashwin Kumar Ramesh,Zhiqiang An,Xiaoqian Jiang,Yejin Kim*

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力评估框架，通过抗体-抗原复合体功能评估抗体设计潜力，比较14种蛋白质模型并发现结构条件逆折叠模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅依赖抗体本身及其与天然抗体的相似性，忽略了抗体-抗原复合体的功能性评估。AbBiBench旨在提供一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: 收集并标准化9个数据集，覆盖9种抗原和155,853个重链突变抗体。比较14种蛋白质模型，利用模型可能性与实验亲和力的相关性评估性能。

Result: 结构条件逆折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。AbBiBench提供了一个统一的生物学评估框架。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为开发功能感知的抗体设计模型提供了有效工具，结构条件逆折叠模型在抗体设计中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 提出潜在空间假说，将多模态医学数据映射到统一潜空间，实现个性化医疗和疾病轨迹分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据多样但蕴含潜在统一生理状态信息，传统病名分类可能掩盖实际病理异质性，需要新框架整合多模态数据支持精准医疗。

Method: 采用几何表示学习方法，将异构数据投影到分层潜空间，通过编码器建模健康状态点、疾病轨迹和治疗向量。

Result: 该框架可揭示疾病亚型轨迹、个体化变化方向，为个性化诊断和动态监测提供量化依据。

Conclusion: 潜在空间模型推动临床实践从标签分类转向个体轨迹导航，需解决数据偏见、稀缺性和因果推断等挑战。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Motivation: 语言障碍患者难以沟通，个性化文本转语音技术可作为辅助工具。本研究旨在通过大型语音模型重建患者患病前的声音，改善其沟通能力。

Method: 采用先进的大型语音模型Parler TTS，通过收集并标注说话人及语音清晰度数据，对模型进行微调以重建发音障碍者患病前的声音。

Result: 模型能够从具有挑战性的数据分布中学习生成语音，但在控制语音清晰度和保持说话人一致性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来需要改进此类模型在语音重建任务中的可控性，以更好地为语言障碍患者提供沟通辅助。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Motivation: 研究语音语言模型中语音-文本联合解码策略对性能、效率和对齐质量的影响，以优化口语对话系统。

Method: 在相同基础语言模型、语音分词器和训练数据下，系统比较了交织和平行生成等联合解码策略，并提出ESI模式。

Result: 交织方法对齐效果最佳但解码慢，ESI模式显著加速解码且性能略有提升。

Conclusion: ESI模式在提升解码速度的同时保持了性能优势，为语音问答系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion

conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RSVP的两阶段框架，通过结合多模态推理和视觉分割，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽然具备强大的推理能力，但缺乏显式的视觉定位和分割机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在差距。

Method: RSVP框架包含两个阶段：推理阶段通过多模态链式思维视觉提示生成可解释的区域提议；分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块（VLSM）结合文本和视觉线索生成精确的分割掩码。

Result: 实验结果表明，RSVP在ReasonSeg数据集上比现有方法提升了6.5 gIoU和9.2 cIoU，在SegInW数据集上零样本设置下达到了49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP通过显式建模多模态推理与分割的交互，为可解释的推理分割提供了新范式，有效整合了认知推理与结构化视觉理解。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个多图像推理基准MMRB，用于评估多模态大语言模型在多个图像上的结构化推理能力，并发现开源模型在此任务上显著落后于商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型基准主要关注单图像视觉推理或多图像理解任务，而缺乏对多图像输入下模型推理能力的全面评估。为解决这一问题，作者提出了MMRB基准。

Method: MMRB包含92个子任务，覆盖空间、时间和语义推理，并采用GPT-4o生成的多解决方案和CoT风格注释。此外，还设计了一个子集用于评估多图像场景下的多模态奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务上显著落后于商业模型，且当前的多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估的空白，并揭示了开源模型与商业模型在此类任务中的差距，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Motivation: 当前胸部X光VQA研究依赖模板化查询且缺乏临床真实性。ReXVQA旨在建立全面评估放射科五大核心推理能力的基准，推动AI实现专家级临床推理。

Method: 构建含69.6万问题/16万X光的数据集，设计5类放射学推理任务，评估8个多模态模型(如MedGemma-4B)，并与3名放射科住院医生进行200案例对比研究。

Result: MedGemma总体准确率83.24%，人类最佳77.27%。AI首次在X光解读上超越人类专家，且放射科医生间的判断一致性显著高于人机之间。

Conclusion: ReXVQA为放射学AI系统设立新标准，其开放数据集和精细化评估体系将推动下一代具有临床推理能力的AI发展。

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

TL;DR: PLUCC提出了一种利用冰球运动员行为上下文信息进行冰球定位的新方法，通过球员朝向和位置作为先验，结合多尺度特征和门控解码机制，显著提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球在转播视频中检测困难，现有方法未充分利用球员行为提供的上下文线索。球员身体和视线总是朝向冰球，这种强关联性成为研究动机。

Method: 提出PLUCC框架：1) 上下文编码器利用球员朝向/位置先验；2) 特征金字塔编码器提取多尺度特征；3) 带通道门控机制的解码器融合特征。

Result: 在PuckDataset上实现SOTA性能：平均精度提升12.2%，提出的无偏指标RSLE精度提升25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对冰球检测至关重要，该成果对自动化体育分析有广泛意义。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但难以解释驱动这些反应的具体特征。研究旨在通过激活最大化技术解决这一问题，深化对人脑视觉系统的理解。

Method: 使用预训练Inception V3网络提取多层激活并降维，通过线性回归预测fMRI响应；应用激活最大化生成针对单个皮层体素的优化图像，并扩展至大脑感兴趣区域(ROI)。

Result: 生成的图像与已知选择性特征定性匹配，可探索视觉皮层选择性；fMRI实验表明这些图像能稳定驱动目标区域活动，适用于不同层级视觉区和被试。

Conclusion: 激活最大化成功应用于DNN编码模型，为灵活表征和调控人脑视觉系统响应提供了新方法，克服了传统生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在并行生成高分辨率图像时存在质量下降、序列长度随分辨率超线性增长及采样计划固定等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出HMAR算法，采用马尔可夫过程进行下一尺度预测，并结合可控多步掩码生成，优化了图像生成的效率和质量。

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，HMAR性能匹配或优于VAR、扩散和自回归基线模型，训练和推理速度分别提升2.5倍和1.75倍。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成效率，还增加了采样灵活性，支持零样本图像编辑任务。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设使用设备视觉-惯性里程计系统估计的帧率6DoF姿态，可能忽略了像素级精确重建所需的关键细节。因此，作者试图解决这一局限性，提高重建质量。

Method: 作者提出了两个主要改进：1) 使用视觉-惯性束调整(VIBA)精确校准滚动快门RGB相机的时间戳和高频轨迹运动；2) 在Gaussian Splatting中引入物理图像形成模型，考虑传感器特性如滚动快门效应和动态范围。

Result: 在开源Project Aria设备和Meta Quest3设备上的实验表明，加入VIBA带来了+1dB的PSNR提升，而提出的图像形成模型进一步提升了+1dB，在各种室内外光照条件下都观察到了持续的质量改进。

Conclusion: 该研究通过精确的相机轨迹校准和考虑传感器特性的物理模型，显著改善了真实感场景重建的质量，为相关领域提供了实用的解决方案和开源实现。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and

neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

TL;DR: 提出Gen-n-Val框架，利用Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量合成数据，解决现有方法在目标检测和实例分割中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉任务中，数据稀缺和标签噪声是主要挑战。现有合成数据生成方法存在多目标掩码、分割不准确和类别标签错误等问题。

Method: Gen-n-Val框架包含两个代理：LD提示代理（LLM优化生成单目标掩码）和数据验证代理（VLLM过滤低质量数据），并通过TextGrad优化系统提示。

Result: 与MosaicFusion相比，无效合成数据从50%降至7%，COCO实例分割中稀有类mAP提升1%，开放词汇目标检测mAP提升7.1%。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val显著提升了合成数据质量，并在实例分割和目标检测任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对视觉语言模型(VLM)的安全性问题，提出了HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA模型，通过全面覆盖五类安全/不安全图像-文本组合及引入可学习安全元标记与专用安全头，显著提升模型安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM安全调优存在两大缺陷：1) 安全数据集仅部分考虑图文交互风险，难以防御未见过的越狱攻击；2) 过度依赖数据调优，缺乏内在安全机制创新。

Method: 构建覆盖全五类图文组合的HoliSafe数据集；提出SafeLLaVA模型，集成可学习安全元标记（编码有害视觉线索）和专用安全头（提供可解释的危害分类）。

Result: 基于HoliSafe训练的SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到最优安全性能，同时HoliSafe基准暴露出现有模型的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA为鲁棒且可解释的VLM安全研究开辟新途径，推动多模态对齐领域发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Result: 发现多模态模型的表示在深层逐渐共享，而不同模态的表示在早期层较为分离。

Conclusion: 多模态模型能通过线性特征表示图像概念，深层网络更倾向于共享跨模态的表示。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third

PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs依赖海量数据提升多模态推理能力，导致数据冗余和计算开销剧增。论文质疑这一假设，发现真正有效的训练样本仅占极少数（认知样本）。

Method: 提出Reasoning Activation Potential（RAP）框架：1）Causal Discrepancy Estimator排除依赖语言先验的样本；2）Attention Confidence Estimator筛除注意力分散样本；3）Difficulty-aware Replacement Module用高难度样本增强数据复杂度。

Result: 在6个数据集上，RAP仅用9.3%训练数据即实现更优性能，计算成本降低43%。

Conclusion: 高质量小数据集可替代全量数据驱动多模态推理，RAP为高效训练MLLMs提供了新范式。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架(MSEF)，结合视觉Transformer和大语言模型，用于可解释的街道景观双输出评估，成功融合客观指标与居民主观感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于影像或GIS的街道客观指标无法捕捉对包容性城市设计至关重要的主观感知，需要一种能同时评估客观特征和主观感受的方法。

Method: 使用VisualGLM-6B和GPT-4构建MSEF框架，采用LoRA和P-Tuning v2对哈尔滨15,000多张街景图像进行参数高效微调。

Result: 模型客观特征F1分数达0.84，与居民感知一致性达89.3%，能识别情境依赖的矛盾（如非正式商业增加活力但降低舒适度）和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF通过生成基于注意力机制的自然语言解释，连接感官数据与社会情感推理，为协调基础设施精确性与生活体验提供了方法论创新和实践工具。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多任务中表现优异，但其对场景底层结构和语义的理解能力尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过提出CIVET框架，以可控、可解释的方式评估VLMs的物体属性和关系理解能力，确保实验无标注噪声和数据偏差。

Result: 研究表明，当前VLMs仅能识别有限的物体属性，性能受物体位置影响显著，且难以理解物体间基本关系，与人脑准确率差距较大。

Conclusion: 现有视觉语言模型在场景理解能力上仍远未达到人类水平，需进一步优化对属性和关系的建模。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估模型容易受对抗攻击影响，导致评分虚高并影响信任。传统数据驱动的防御方法存在局限性，研究希望通过设计而非训练来提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 通过强制信息流正交化和保持范数的操作来重塑模型内部结构，并结合剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统。

Result: 无需对抗训练或大幅修改原模型，该方法就能使IQA架构抵抗对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 论文提出从数据优化转向通过设计工程化来增强模型鲁棒性的新视角。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练依赖固定扰动预算，无法解决实例间鲁棒性差异问题；而IAAT等启发式方法对数据鲁棒性的估计不够动态精准。

Method: DES框架整合决策边界距离（梯度逼近）、预测置信度（softmax熵）和模型不确定性（蒙特卡洛dropout）三个指标，动态调整每样本每次迭代的扰动预算。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100上，DES相比固定预算和现有自适应方法，均取得更高的对抗鲁棒性和标准准确率，并提供了理论收敛性分析。

Conclusion: DES为数据驱动的实例级对抗训练开辟了新方向，其动态调度策略可有效平衡模型鲁棒性与准确性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要显式处理对称性问题，且针对配准和组装的任务独立设计。本文旨在提供一个统一框架，自动学习对称性并提升任务通用性。

Method: 通过连续点速度场将噪声点云传输至目标位置，并采用自监督编码器专注于重叠点，实现对称性的无监督学习。

Result: 在6个点云配准和形状组装基准测试中取得最优表现，联合训练可学习共享几何先验，显著提升精度。

Conclusion: 统一的条件生成框架能有效学习几何先验与对称性，为多任务点云处理提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Conclusion: DirectLayout框架有效提升了文本到3D布局的生成质量，为场景合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Motivation: 现有图像分割模型虽能生成高质量掩码，但无法通过语言+视觉的综合查询提供语义理解，限制了其交互应用。

Method: 提出RAS框架：通过掩码中心化的大型多模态模型，增强分割模型处理文本/视觉混合提示的能力，并构建MaskGroups数据集进行训练。

Result: RAS在新型ORES任务及传统RES、GRES任务中均展现出优越性能。

Conclusion: ORES任务和RAS框架有效桥接了视觉语言理解与分割任务，为复杂交互场景提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）在RAG等应用中至关重要，但有时会产生过于相似的结果。在某些情况下，搜索结果应在与查询相似的同时保持多样性。

Method: LotusFilter使用预计算的截断表，记录相互靠近的向量，并在过滤过程中通过贪婪查找删除候选冗余向量。

Result: 实验表明，LotusFilter在类似真实RAG应用的环境中运行速度快（0.02毫秒/查询），并使用如OpenAI嵌入等功能。

Conclusion: LotusFilter作为一种高效的后处理模块，成功实现了在保持结果相关性的同时增加多样性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型中跨模态记忆的特性，通过合成数据集进行控制实验，发现模态间知识转移存在显著差距，并提出了改进基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络在训练时记忆的内容和方式至关重要，尤其是跨模态记忆在多模态模型中的特性。现有研究多关注单模态记忆，而多模态模型日益普及，因此需要更深入的研究。

Method: 引入合成人物数据集，通过单模态训练并在另一模态评估，量化跨模态知识转移能力。实验涵盖多种场景，包括模型能力、机器去学习和多跳情况。

Result: 研究发现模态间知识可以转移，但源模态和目标模态间的信息回忆存在显著差距，这一差距在多种实验场景中均存在。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了跨模态记忆的挑战，并提出了改进方法，希望为未来开发更鲁棒的多模态学习技术提供启发。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

TL;DR: 论文提出Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)和其增强版Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，通过结合概念特征与图像特征提升医疗AI的可解释性，同时解决现有概念瓶颈模型在输入扰动下解释不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对透明性的高需求促使可解释AI研究。现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)仅依赖概念特征进行预测，忽视了医学图像的内在特征嵌入，且在输入扰动时解释不稳定，限制了医疗应用。

Method: 提出VCT模型融合概念特征与图像特征；进一步开发SVCT，采用Vision Transformer (ViT)架构，集成概念层，并引入Denoised Diffusion Smoothing提升模型稳定性。

Result: 在四个医疗数据集上验证表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具备可解释性。SVCT尤其在扰动环境下能提供稳定的解释，满足医疗领域需求。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT有效平衡了医疗AI的准确性与可解释性，SVCT通过抗扰动设计进一步提升了模型可靠性，为医疗AI应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Motivation: 传统PINN在处理复杂空间层级和边界条件时存在局限性，需要一种更高效且稳定的解决方案。

Method: 通过自适应CNN层提取局部特征，并采用动态加权损失函数强化物理约束。

Result: 实验表明BridgeNet在误差指标、收敛速度和稳定性上均优于传统PINN方法。

Conclusion: BridgeNet为计算物理领域提供了可扩展且精确的解法，适用于金融数学和复杂系统动力学等领域。

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

Motivation: 传统的基因集分析方法（GSA）忽略了临床背景分析，经常产生冗余、非特异性或无关的结果，影响了分析的可靠性和可重复性。

Method: cGSA框架通过整合基因簇检测、富集分析和大型语言模型，进行背景感知的路径优先排序。

Result: 在102个手工整理的基因集和19种疾病的测试中，cGSA表现优于基线方法30%以上，并在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌的案例研究中验证了其潜力。

Conclusion: cGSA不仅能识别统计显著的路径，还能发现生物意义重大的路径，增强了目标假设生成的针对性。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简化最优控制问题求解的方法，通过解耦训练过程和最优控制问题，仅需一次物理信息训练阶段即可解决多个最优控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经网络方法在解决最优控制问题时，通常需要将代价函数纳入训练过程，导致架构复杂且计算繁琐。本文旨在简化这一流程，证明无需在训练中考虑代价函数。

Method: 采用简单神经算子架构（如DeepONet），结合无约束优化流程，通过添加基于微分方程残差的惩罚项，并利用自动微分计算控制梯度。

Result: 在三个不同的微分方程模型上训练了三个DeepONet模型，解决了九个最优控制问题，展示了在所有案例中一致且准确的性能。

Conclusion: 通过解耦训练与优化阶段，简化了最优控制问题的求解流程，证明了单一训练阶段可适应多种代价函数的最优控制问题。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so)在处理随机多目标优化问题时，能够有效逼近Pareto最优集，并在计算效率和性能上优于对比算法。

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Motivation: 当前预训练视觉语言模型在复杂3D场景空间定位和动态推理方面表现不足，需要更精确的空间理解和推理能力。

Method: 结合监督微调（SFT）的分离深度编码器实现精确空间理解，并通过强化微调（RFT）设计指标敏感奖励函数支持多步空间推理。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer空间理解成功率89.6%；RFT版本在RefSpatial-Bench上平均准确率超越Gemini-2.5-Pro达17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer可集成多种控制策略，在杂乱真实场景中实现跨机器人的长周期动态任务，显著推进了空间指代表现。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嗅觉导航任务中的气体动态和环境因素干扰使得OIO难以实现精确导航，本文旨在通过校准OIO方法解决这些问题，并展示其在机器人手术和无接触安检中的应用潜力。

Method: 定义了一个适用于多种嗅觉传感器类型的OIO校准流程，并在真实机器人平台上进行了校准实验。

Result: 实验表明，该校准方法显著改善了机器人初始嗅探任务（cold-start olfactory navigation）的性能。

Conclusion: 通过提出的OIO校准方法，机器人能够在缓慢移动时更准确地定位气味源，为未来在医疗和安全领域的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

*Kordel K. France*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型数学回归方法，将计时电流法在室温离子液体中的测量时间缩短至1秒以内，显著提升了检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在室温离子液体中，高粘度和缓慢的质量传输导致测量时间延长，传统计时电流法通常需要1-4秒或更长时间，限制了分析效率。

Method: 通过应用推断算法对初始瞬态电流响应进行分析，该方法无需额外硬件修改即可预测稳态电化学参数。

Result: 该方法在保持合理精度的同时，显著减少了数据采集时间，并通过标准计时电流技术验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该技术在分析化学、传感器技术和电池科学等领域具有重要应用价值，能够实现更快速的电化学定量分析。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

TL;DR: 提出kTULA算法，用于处理对数梯度超线性增长的分布采样问题，改进现有收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习应用中，全局Lipschitz连续性条件常不满足，需处理对数梯度超线性增长的分布采样问题。

Method: 提出基于tamed Langevin动态的kTULA算法，解决超线性对数梯度分布采样问题。

Result: 在KL散度中建立了最佳收敛速率2-ε的收敛界，显著改进现有结果，并在Wasserstein-2距离中得到更好的误差界。

Conclusion: kTULA在高维双井势分布采样和神经网络优化问题中展示了应用潜力，并提供理论性能保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于CEGAR的扩展方法来解决量化整数规划(QIP)问题，并在多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题中表现出优于现有基于搜索的求解器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QIP通过引入变量量化和线性约束，扩展了量化布尔公式(QBF)和整数规划的能力，使其能够处理复杂决策问题和不确定性优化问题。然而，现有的QIP求解方法大多基于搜索，缺乏对扩展方法的研究。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 论文采用了基于反例引导抽象精化(CEGAR)的扩展方法，将QBF中的技术适配到QIP中，并进一步嵌入优化框架来处理多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在特定情况下优于现有的基于搜索的QIP求解器，并且由于能够利用线性约束建模问题，性能显著优于最先进的基于扩展的QBF求解器。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于扩展的求解方法，QIP在处理多阶段鲁棒优化问题时展现出更高的效率和适用性，为复杂决策和不确定性优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

TL;DR: 本文研究了检索增强生成(RAG)系统中针对中毒文本的攻击，提出了一种基于注意力模式的防御方法，并探讨了更隐蔽的自适应攻击的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统容易受到低比例中毒文本攻击，且现有攻击缺乏隐蔽性，易被检测。这促使研究者探索如何通过分析生成过程中的中间信号（如注意力模式）来提升防御能力。

Method: 提出了基于注意力模式的标准化段落注意力分数(NPAS)，并开发了注意力方差过滤算法来识别和过滤潜在中毒文本。

Result: 该方法可有效防御现有攻击，将准确率比基线防御提升约20%。但研究也发现隐蔽的自适应攻击仍能达到35%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 基于注意力模式的防御能有效应对现有攻击，但针对高度隐蔽的自适应攻击仍需进一步研究。这凸显了提升防御系统隐蔽性检测能力的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于差分隐私的大型语言模型微调框架，用于放射学报告的多异常分类，旨在保护患者隐私同时保持分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在敏感医疗数据上微调大型语言模型时可能导致的隐私泄露风险，研究旨在开发一种既能保护患者隐私又不显著降低分类性能的方法。

Method: 研究使用了50,232份放射学报告进行实验，采用差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）方法在不同隐私预算下微调模型，评估了三种模型架构在两类数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，在中等隐私保证下，模型的加权F1分数与无隐私保护的基线相当，MIMIC-CXR数据集上为0.88，CT-RATE数据集上为0.59。

Conclusion: 采用差分隐私的LoRA微调方法能有效且保护隐私地进行放射学报告的多异常分类，解决了在敏感医疗数据上微调模型的关键挑战。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

TL;DR: 提出名为BESA的方法，通过扰动检测和恢复模块增强编码器窃取攻击，有效对抗基于扰动的防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有基于扰动的防御机制阻碍编码器窃取攻击性能的问题，提出一种能够克服此类防御的攻击方法。

Method: BESA包含两个核心模块：扰动检测和扰动恢复。检测模块识别防御机制，恢复模块通过生成模型还原干净特征向量。

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御及多重防御组合时，将现有编码器窃取攻击的代理编码器精度提升高达24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA显著提升了编码器窃取攻击在防御环境下的有效性，展现了强大的对抗能力。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型（LLM）和检索增强生成（RAG）自动执行攻击缓解策略的框架，显著提升策略符合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算环境日益复杂，网络威胁更加精密，需要更强健、自适应和自动化的安全执行方法。

Method: 通过上下文学习和RAG技术，收集工具及API规格并存储于矢量数据库，将高级缓解策略分解为任务后转为可执行API调用。

Result: 采用RAG相比非RAG基线在精确率、召回率和F1分数上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与RAG的框架能有效自动化安全策略执行，提高防御效率。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注微调过程中对越狱事件的反应处理，忽视了上游安全对齐数据的作用，本文旨在探索其对安全防护退化的影响。

Method: 通过分析上游对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性，评估其对模型安全防护的影响。

Result: 实验表明，两数据集高相似性会显著削弱安全防护，使模型更易被越狱；低相似性则能提升模型鲁棒性，降低有害性评分达10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建持久安全防护至关重要，研究结果为微调服务提供商提供了可操作的改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集范围狭窄，缺乏针对多平台和多分类任务的支持，且未涵盖实际检测中难以捕获的规避性恶意文件。

Method: 与EMBER2017/2018团队合作，新版数据集包含320万文件，支持6种文件格式和7种分类任务，并引入规避检测的挑战集。

Result: EMBER2024提供文件哈希、元数据、特征向量及标签，首次包含反病毒软件初始未检测到的恶意文件集，并升级特征支持。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在提升研究可复现性，推动恶意软件检测新方法的开发，特别针对规避型恶意软件的识别。

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在审计序列模型隐私泄露风险时存在不足，主要源于假设不匹配的问题，需要更有效地测量序列模型中的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 通过改进现有最先进的成员推理攻击方法，显式建模序列内相关性，以适应序列模型的结构。

Result: 改进后的方法在不增加计算成本的情况下，显著提升了记忆审计的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型序列模型的可靠记忆审计奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

### [330] [BEAR: BGP Event Analysis and Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04514)
*Hanqing Li,Melania Fedeli,Vinay Kolar,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出BEAR框架，利用大语言模型自动生成BGP异常事件的详细报告，提升网络管理的解释性和分析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP异常（如路由泄露和劫持）可能威胁网络可靠性和安全，现有方法需专家深度解读。BEAR旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: BEAR通过多步推理将BGP表格数据转化为文本叙述，并利用LLM生成合成数据以解决公开数据不足问题。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估显示，BEAR准确率达100%，优于思维链和上下文学习基线。

Conclusion: BEAR开创了自动解释BGP异常事件的方法，为网络管理提供了实用的操作洞察。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文研究WiFi 7中的动态信道分配问题，提出基于BAI-MCTS和LLM-BAI-MCTS的智能算法，显著提升密集网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7的多链路操作(MLO)虽能提高吞吐量和降低延迟，但在密集网络中的动态信道分配仍面临挑战。现有研究多集中于静态网络配置，缺乏对动态环境的优化方案。

Method: 将问题建模为组合优化，并采用多臂老虎机(MAB)框架在线学习最优分配。提出BAI-MCTS算法及结合大语言模型的LLM-BAI-MCTS改进方案。

Result: BAI-MCTS算法收敛速度比现有技术快50.44%，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中进一步提速63.32%，且具有更强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的智能算法有效解决了WiFi 7密集网络的动态信道分配问题，为未来网络优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

TL;DR: 移动网络运营商（MNOs）未充分利用数据资产，而数据分析是提升价值的关键。3GPP的NWDAF为数据分析和预测提供支持，但学术研究受限于数据集和方法。本文分析70多篇文章的趋势和差距，并提出两个新用例以促进NWDAF的应用和变现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动网络运营商（MNOs）在数字经济中未能充分利用数据资产，而OTT玩家则因此主导了市场估值。为打破连接商品化的局限并提供更高客户价值，数据分析成为关键战略推动因素。

Method: 本文通过分析超过70篇学术文章，研究了NWDAF的应用趋势和现有研究的局限性，并提出了两种新颖的用例。

Result: 研究发现了现有学术研究在方法及用例上的局限性，主要受限于数据集的可获取性，同时提出了两种新的用例以增强NWDAF的应用潜力和变现能力。

Conclusion: 通过更广泛的数据分析和用例开发，移动网络运营商可以更有效地利用数据资产，提升运营效率和服务创新，从而在数字经济中获得更大的竞争优势。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 该研究利用1992-2022年美国犯罪受害调查数据，分析收入、教育等社会经济因素及人口特征对暴力犯罪与财产犯罪受害类型的影响，发现不同地区预测效果差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社会经济因素（如收入、教育）和人口特征（如年龄、种族）如何影响个人遭受暴力犯罪或财产犯罪的可能性，为针对性犯罪预防策略提供依据。

Method: 使用平衡分类样本和逻辑回归模型（以F1分数评估），先后建立仅含社会经济变量的“A组”模型和加入人口控制变量的“B组”模型。

Result: 高收入和高教育水平降低暴力犯罪受害几率；男性、年轻人和少数族裔面临更高暴力犯罪风险。郊区模型预测效度最佳（准确率0.607），农村地区犯罪仍难预测。

Conclusion: 需针对不同地区采取差异化干预措施，如都会区加强教育投资、农村提供经济支持，并制定考虑人口特征的预防策略。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

Result: 模型在三个不同数据集上的癌症检测AUROC分别为0.89、0.96和0.94；在病灶定位方面表现出色，与放射科医生的分类和定位一致性分别达到83.5%和84.0%（活检确认病例）以及78.1%和79.6%（非本地病例）。专家接受率平均为96.7%（活检确认病例）和89.3%（非本地病例）。

Conclusion: 该系统在乳腺癌检测和病灶定位方面表现出色，具有良好的临床接受度和潜力，可用于改善乳腺X光摄影筛查工作流程。

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Motivation: 联邦学习中参数高效微调（PEFT）虽然能提高隐私和训练效率，但其可能通过预训练模型和可训练适配模块的设计导致用户数据隐私泄露。

Method: 研究采用梯度反演攻击方法，针对流行的PEFT机制——适配器，利用可访问的适配器梯度重构目标用户的本地数据样本。

Result: 实验表明，攻击者可以高保真度地重构大批量的微调图像数据，验证了PEFT存在的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了PEFT需要额外的隐私保护机制，同时为未来的研究方向提供了新的视角和挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-文本模型在零样本环境声音分类中表现良好，但当存在背景声音时性能显著下降。论文旨在解决这一问题，提升模型在复杂声学环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过量化背景声源的贡献并将其整合到分类过程中，同时分析了音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距，并提出减小这一差距的技术。

Result: 该方法在不需重新训练模型的情况下提升了分类性能，并在不同背景和信噪比条件下均表现出更高的准确性，且能泛化到现有的先进原型方法中。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效提升了音频-文本模型在复杂环境中的分类性能，具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，为环境声音分类提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种通过隐式和显式方法提升音素/韵律标签与字形一致性的模型，在口音估计等下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型微调方法无法保证音素/韵律标签与字形的一致性，制约了语音-文本平行数据在下游任务中的应用。

Method: 1) 使用预训练BERT特征通过提示编码器实现隐式字形条件化；2) 在推理阶段显式剪枝与字形不一致的标签假设。

Result: 显著提升标签与字形一致性，生成的高质量平行数据使口音估计准确率有效提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可生成语音-标签-字形三模态对齐数据，为TTS等任务提供更可靠的监督信号。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Motivation: 音素基础的多语言预训练和跨语言微调在数据效率和性能上有优势，但传统WFST解码方法流程复杂且无法利用大语言模型（LLMs）。

Method: 提出LLM-P2G解码方法，包含语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两个阶段，并引入数据增强（DANP）和随机化Top-K边缘化（TKM）训练策略解决信息丢失问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM-P2G在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，相对词错误率分别降低了3.6%和6.9%，优于WFST系统。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的音素到字素解码方法在跨语言ASR任务中表现优越，展示了其在简化流程和提升性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的AI音乐生成模型依赖固定数据集训练，难以准确响应用户的主观需求。音乐的高度个性化特性使得这一点尤为关键。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提高了AI音乐生成模型的用户体验，通过迭代优化逐步提升了用户评分。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Exp4Fuse的新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索器性能，在多个数据集上超越现有方法并取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的假设文件虽然能增强信息检索效果，但其质量依赖复杂提示策略和高计算成本的密集检索技术。论文旨在通过零样本LLM查询扩展低成本地提升稀疏检索器性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架：同时利用原始查询和LLM增强查询生成两条检索路径，通过稀疏检索器产生两个排序列表，并采用改进的逆序融合方法合并结果。

Result: 在MS MARCO相关数据集和7个低资源数据集上的实验表明，Exp4Fuse不仅优于现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时还在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse有效解决了传统LLM查询扩展的成本问题，为稀疏检索器的性能提升提供了高效解决方案，证明了其在查询扩展领域的优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse

### [343] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出GOLFer方法，通过小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展，解决大模型依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型(LLM)的查询扩展方法成本高、计算资源大且可访问性有限，需使用更大更先进的模型。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（剔除生成文档中的非事实性句子）和文档组合器（用权重向量平衡查询与过滤后内容）。

Result: 在3个网页搜索和10个低资源数据集上，GOLFer始终优于其他使用小型模型的方法，并与大型LLM方法保持相当性能。

Conclusion: GOLFer证明通过优化小型模型架构，可在降低成本的同时保持查询扩展的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Yubo Ma,Jinsong Li,Yuhang Zang,Xiaobao Wu,Xiaoyi Dong,Pan Zhang,Yuhang Cao,Haodong Duan,Jiaqi Wang,Yixin Cao,Aixin Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究通过两种标记缩减策略（token剪枝和合并）优化ColPali/ColQwen2的内存占用，发现合并策略更适合可视化文档检索，最终开发出仅需11.8%原内存但保持98.2%性能的轻量版模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ColPali/ColQwen2在可视化文档检索（VDR）中表现优异，但其分块嵌入方式导致内存占用过高。本研究旨在探索如何以最小性能损失减少每页的嵌入标记数量。

Method: 评估了两种标记缩减策略：1) 标记剪枝（包括随机剪枝和其他复杂方法）；2) 标记合并（通过三维度搜索最优合并策略组合）。最终基于合并策略开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: 轻量版模型仅需11.8%原内存即可保持98.2%检索性能，在2.8%内存占用下仍保留94.6%效果。随机剪枝表现优于其他剪枝方法但整体不适合VDR任务。

Conclusion: 标记合并更适合VDR需求，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2为高效VDR研究提供了有价值的基准。该实证研究揭示了不同缩减策略的特性差异。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了R2Rec框架，通过逐步推理增强推荐系统，结合监督微调和强化学习，显著提升推荐效果和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作直接将LLM应用于推荐任务效果不佳，因用户反馈隐式且缺乏推理监督。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出结合推理的推荐框架。

Method: R2Rec通过用户-项目图生成交互链，利用逐步掩码提示策略转化为结构化思维，结合监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec在HitRatio@1指标上平均提升10.48%，且推理链增强了推荐的可解释性。

Conclusion: R2Rec有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中的适应性问题，为推荐任务提供了新的推理增强范式。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工智能在医学中因技术中心化方法导致的临床应用鸿沟问题。

Result: 框架强调实用价值而非超人类基准表现，提升系统与临床实践的兼容性。

Conclusion: 通过社技术念重构AI医疗工具，可有效弥合转化鸿沟并实现真实临床影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有团队优化工具依赖静态数据，无法适应动态个性、目标和偏好的变化，导致成员不满和协作效率低下。

Result: 开发出动态匹配成员偏好的组建框架、实时提升凝聚力的AI助手以及模拟真实协作的仿真环境。

Conclusion: AI增强的团队优化系统能有效平衡个体与集体目标，持续提升团队整体效能。

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，用于快速生成高精度质子治疗剂量分布图，显著降低了计算时间同时保持高准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMPT治疗头颈部肿瘤时需要频繁的在线适应性放疗调整，这依赖于快速且准确的蒙卡剂量计算。减少粒子计数能加速计算但会降低精度，因此需要开发去噪方法来平衡速度与精度。

Method: 使用80例头颈部患者数据生成噪声/高统计剂量图，构建扩散变换器模型进行去噪训练（输入噪声图+CT，输出高统计图），采用复合损失函数优化模型性能。

Result: 模型在各部位测试中MAE低于0.376Gy，三维Gamma通过率>92%（3%/2mm），DVH指标与真实值高度吻合，展现了跨病种的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于头颈部数据训练的扩散变换器去噪框架能有效泛化至多癌种，实现快速高精度的剂量计算，支持临床适应性放疗需求。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Motivation: 在确保AI系统负责任性的背景下，验证复制体是否保持可信度是一个重要但未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 引入概率复杂查询的演算模型，定义四种可信度概念(合理、同等、弱、近似可信)，并通过分析复制体行为进行验证。

Result: 建立了不同可信度概念之间的关系，研究了它们的组合特性以及在逻辑运算下的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为验证源自已知行为的复杂系统复制体的可信度提供了计算工具。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨如何通过开放系统（如区块链与AI代理结合的Spore.fun实验）实现开放式进化（OEE），突破传统封闭模拟系统的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工生命（ALife）研究中，封闭系统（如Tierra、Avida）难以实现持续的开放式进化（OEE），学者认为需开放系统与外部环境交互。区块链和去中心化基础设施（DePIN）为构建此类开放系统提供了新可能。

Method: 以Spore.fun为案例，研究基于区块链和TEE的自主AI代理的进化行为及轨迹，采用数字行为学方法分析其与环境和经济的互动。

Result: Spore.fun展示了链上AI代理在无许可计算和经济激励驱动下的自主进化潜力，为开放式ALife系统提供了实践验证。

Conclusion: 开放、无许可且经济激励驱动的ALife系统（如Spore.fun）可能是实现OEE的关键路径，但仍需进一步讨论与研究。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Conclusion: 联盟感知的信用分配对提升多智能体强化学习性能至关重要，CORA方法有效解决了过更新问题。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要用于同步通信，而现实世界中的许多场景（如群聊、在线团队会议或社交游戏）本质上是异步的，缺乏明确的轮流发言机制。因此，研究如何让LLM代理在异步环境中决定何时发言具有重要意义。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，该代理能够决定何时发言以及发言内容。为了评估代理，作者收集了一个独特的在线Mafia游戏数据集，包括人类玩家和异步代理的参与。

Result: 异步LLM代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面的能力与人类玩家相当。分析显示，代理在决定何时发言时的行为模式与人类相似，但在发言内容上存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在现实人类群体环境中的集成铺平了道路，从团队讨论辅助到需要处理复杂社交动态的教育和专业环境。作者还发布了所有数据和代码，以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.
