### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自监督方法GEM，使仅解码器的大语言模型（LLMs）在保持生成能力的同时生成高质量文本嵌入，解决了传统方法依赖独立嵌入模型导致的系统复杂性和理解不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）等应用需依赖独立嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，导致系统复杂化，且嵌入模型与LLMs对查询的理解可能存在差异。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码生成文本摘要嵌入，该方法可轻松集成至现有LLMs的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B-8B参数的LLM上实验表明，MTEB文本嵌入基准显著提升，而MMLU等NLP基准性能影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法赋予LLMs先进文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原有NLP性能，验证了自监督嵌入生成路径的有效性。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在低资源训练下，增加说话者数量而非单说话者时长或口音多样性，能更有效提升ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为构建适用于全球用户的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，需提升其对多种口音（包括未见口音）的鲁棒性，尤其在低资源训练条件下。

Method: 系统研究训练数据中三个变量（说话者数量、单说话者音频时长、口音多样性）对ASR未见口音鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 固定训练时长时，增加说话者数量（而非单说话者时长）更有效；说话者数量多时，增加训练时长效果更显著；控制说话者数量时，口音多样性收益有限。

Conclusion: 构建新语言ASR训练数据时，应优先增加说话者数量而非单说话者时长或口音多样性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于字典学习的可解释性句子嵌入分解方法，揭示嵌入内部语义和句法的线性编码特征，提升表征透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有句子嵌入系统缺乏可解释性，其相似度度量无法追溯特征来源，且通过复杂神经网络和池化操作后内容难以解析。

Method: 在token级表征上应用字典学习进行机制性分解，分析池化操作对特征的压缩过程，并评估句子嵌入中的潜在特征。

Result: 发现嵌入空间线性编码了大量语义/句法特征，实现了token级机制解释与句子级分析的跨层次连接。

Conclusion: 该方法使句子嵌入具有可解释性和可控性，为理解嵌入空间工作机制提供了新视角，如线性编码规律的发现。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HTC-CLIP模型，通过对比学习结合层次感知文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，在推理时融合两种概率分布，提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别独立处理标签层次结构或将其嵌入文本编码器，未能有效结合两种互补的层次特征表达方式。

Method: 使用对比学习框架，同步训练层次感知的文本编码器和文本引导的路径层次编码器，在推理阶段通过概率分布融合双路输出。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集上实现Macro F1分数0.99%-2.37%的提升，超越现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模文本与层次结构的双向交互，验证了融合两种传统方法的有效性，为层次分类任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了55个公开大语言模型在马耳他语（低资源语言）上的表现，发现多数模型尤其在生成任务上表现不佳，而较小微调模型表现更优。预训练和指令调整中的马耳他语接触是关键，微调虽成本高但效果更好。建议低资源语言研究考虑传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其对低资源语言（如马耳他语）的有效性仍有限。研究旨在探索LLMs在低资源语言上的性能瓶颈及改进方向。

Method: 使用新构建的涵盖11个判别式和生成式任务的基准测试，评估55个公开LLMs在马耳他语上的表现，并通过多维度分析（如预训练数据、微调与提示策略）探究性能影响因素。

Result: 多数模型表现较差（尤其是生成任务），较小微调模型整体更优；预训练和指令调整中接触马耳他语是性能关键因素；微调虽初始成本高，但性能更优且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: 低资源语言需更包容的语言技术，建议结合传统语言建模方法。模型性能提升依赖于预训练阶段的语种覆盖，且微调在效果与长期成本上优于提示策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合嵌入器与分类器的模型架构，通过监督微调和多语言知识蒸馏策略，实现在跨领域（渠道、地域、语言）少样本意图检测中准确率提升20-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在客户服务领域依赖大量标注数据，但跨领域数据稀缺导致模型泛化能力受限。开发一种仅需少量标注即可跨领域应用的意图分类器具有重要实践价值。

Method: 采用监督微调结合各向同性正则化训练领域专用嵌入器，并通过多语言知识蒸馏扩展至多领域。最终嵌入器与线性分类器结合部署至新领域。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客服数据集上的少样本意图检测实验中，准确率较现有SOTA模型提升20-23%。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了跨领域数据稀缺问题，验证了模型在少样本场景下跨渠道、地域和语言迁移的实用性。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 人类规模的语言模型能泛化处理罕见语法结构的形式，但对意义的泛化能力不足，揭示当前架构在语言形式与意义学习效率上的不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大规模预训练语言模型是否像人类一样能从常见语法泛化到罕见结构，并验证其是否同时掌握形式与意义。

Method: 构建针对英语LET-ALONE结构的合成测试基准，评估模型对其句法形式与语义属性的敏感性，并过滤数据集中相关结构以控制变量。

Result: 模型对LET-ALONE的形式敏感（即使相关结构被过滤），但无法正确泛化其语义含义。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型架构在形式与意义泛化上存在样本效率不对称，与人类语言学习机制存在本质差异。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出零样本开放模式结构发现方法ZOES，通过无预定义模式或标注数据，利用增强、精炼、统一机制提升大模型实体结构提取的完整性和泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大模型的实体结构提取方法依赖预定义模式或标注数据，导致结果不完整。需开发无需先验知识的开放模式方法。

Method: ZOES采用实体与结构互增强机制，通过Enrichment（语义扩展）、Refinement（迭代优化）、Unification（结构融合）三阶段实现零样本开放模式提取。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验表明，ZOES显著提升大模型提取实体结构的完整性，验证了方法的有效性和领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 增强-精炼-统一机制可作为大模型实体结构发现的通用框架，在不同场景下提升知识抽取质量。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种主流大语言模型水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对模型真实性、安全性和帮助性的影响，揭示了水印引发的「防护衰减」与「防护放大」退化模式，并提出基于推理时对齐重采样（AR）的方法，在保持水印可检测性的同时有效恢复模型对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印技术对大型语言模型输出质量的影响机制尚不明确，特别是对模型核心对齐属性（真实性/安全性/帮助性）的潜在损害缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过实验揭示水印引发的两种对立退化模式，提出对齐重采样（AR）方法：在推理阶段使用外部奖励模型对2-4个水印生成结果进行采样，改进标准Gumbel水印实现以提升响应多样性。

Result: AR方法在2-4次采样内即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数，改进后的Gumbel水印在保持可检测性的同时支持AR，实验证明该方法适用于两种水印方案。

Conclusion: 水印强度与模型对齐存在本质矛盾，AR作为轻量级推理时解决方案，通过平衡检测鲁棒性与对齐性能，为水印技术的负责任部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PUGC框架，利用未标注用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式偏好生成偏好数据，降低对齐大语言模型的标注成本，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖人工或高级LLM标注数据，成本高且难以扩展。UGC虽非显式标注，但隐含创作者偏好，可作为低成本偏好数据来源。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询并生成响应，以UGC自身作为参考文本进行响应评分，实现模型与隐式偏好的对齐。结合DPO算法进行训练。

Result: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct模型时，DPO+PUGC在Alpaca Eval 2上取得35.93%的SOTA胜率（长度控制），性能提升9.37%。奖励质量、领域对齐鲁棒性及心智理论能力均显著提升。

Conclusion: PUGC通过挖掘UGC隐式偏好，实现高质量、可扩展的领域对齐，为降低对齐成本提供新路径，同时保持对UGC质量波动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SLIDE方法，结合大模型（LLM）和小模型（SLM）的互补优势，通过双阶段优化（DRE）提升对话评估的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在模糊场景下表现不稳定，而小语言模型（SLM）对对抗性输入敏感，但两者在处理正/负例时各有优势，需结合互补能力。

Method: SLIDE方法通过自适应加权整合LLM和SLM；进一步提出双阶段优化DRE：先用SLM指导LLM生成初步评估，再用SLM调整LLM评分以提高准确性。

Result: 实验表明DRE优于现有方法，在多类基准测试中与人类判断的一致性更强。

Conclusion: 结合大小模型能构建更可靠的评估工具，尤其在开放任务（如对话评估）中效果显著。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

*Di Wu,Seth Aycock,Christof Monz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在翻译任务中，直接提示LLM「再次翻译」比显式分步推理更有效，质疑了分步翻译策略的实际效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验显式分步推理(Chain-of-Thought)在LLM翻译任务中的有效性，特别是针对《Translating Step-by-step》方法声称的分步优化效果。

Method: 通过实证分析对比显式分步翻译与简单「再次翻译」提示策略，测试不同LLM在WMT24等任务上的表现。

Result: 未发现分步翻译带来明确性能提升，简单要求模型「再次翻译」反而取得更优结果，表明性能增益可能不源于显式推理过程。

Conclusion: 研究不否定推理机制的作用，但强调需重新审视CoT在翻译中的有效性机制，未来应探索分步提示以外的潜在影响因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示大语言模型（LLMs）能部分区分英语小品词'just'的语义类别，但难以捕捉更细微的差异，突显其对语篇小品词理解的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确识别英语小品词'just'的多种细微语义（如排他性、时间性、强调性），因其多义性对语义/语篇效果影响显著。

Method: 使用语言学家精心标注的英语'just'多义数据集，测试LLMs在细粒度语义区分任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs可区分较宽泛语义类别，但对更微妙的语义差异（如排他性与时间性用法的过渡区域）识别能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs对语篇小品词的语义理解存在局限性，需改进模型在细粒度语义推理方面的能力。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在无法合理回答问题场景下的表现评估价值，突破传统仅关注可解问题的评测范式。

Method: 开发包含无解问题的基准测试框架，并提出对现有数据集进行适应性改造的技术方案。

Result: 实验表明当前主流模型在无解问题上的处理能力与理想水平存在显著差距。

questions. Our code and data artifacts are available at

TL;DR: 该研究针对非洲低资源语言机器翻译评估的挑战，提出了大规模标注数据集SSA-MTE及改进指标SSA-COMET，显著提升评估性能并开源资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估指标在非洲低资源语言中面临语言覆盖不足、小规模评估集、公开训练数据缺乏及极端低资源场景性能不稳定等问题。

Method: 构建覆盖13种非洲语言、含6.3万标注的SSA-MTE数据集，开发SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE指标，并基于GPT-4o等大模型进行基准测试。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，在Twi等低资源语言上与Gemini 2.5 Pro表现相当，且开源所有资源。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE数据集与新型评估方法有效解决了非洲低资源语言机器翻译评估难题，为未来研究提供开放基准。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

TL;DR: 研究揭示多智能体系统（MAS）在面临恶意代理通过提示词操纵发起的隐蔽攻击时存在安全漏洞，提出四种攻击类型并验证其可绕过当前LLM监控系统，强调需加强安全协议和监测机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体系统（MAS）在协作中展现潜力，但其可能被恶意代理通过不破坏核心功能的隐蔽操作利用，现有基于LLM的监控系统对此类攻击的防御能力不足，需系统性探索攻击手段与防御方案。

Method: 提出并验证四种攻击类型：误导系统低估他人贡献的Scapegoater、夸大自身表现的Boaster、操控他人行为的Self-Dealer、转嫁任务的Free-Rider，通过设计针对性提示词操纵MAS行为，并测试其对GPT-4o-mini等监控系统的绕过能力。

Result: 实验表明精心设计的提示词可系统性偏置MAS行为与指令执行，使恶意代理成功误导评估系统并操控协作代理，且攻击可突破当前先进LLM监控系统的检测。

Conclusion: 当前MAS架构需强化安全协议与内容验证机制，并开发具备全面风险评估能力的监控系统，以应对隐蔽提示词攻击对系统完整性的威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在零样本金融情感分析任务中，直觉型系统1』快速思维（如无CoT提示的GPT-4o）比推理型系统2』更接近人类判断，推理反而可能因过度思考导致预测偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融情感分析中的有效性，验证推理机制（如CoT提示）是否能提升模型与人类专家标注的一致性，并挑战『更多推理必然更好』的默认假设。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，对比三种专有LLM（GPT-4o等）在系统1/系统2提示范式下的表现，并与微调金融模型（FinBERT系列）进行基准测试，分析语言复杂度与标注一致性对结果的影响。

Result: 1. 推理机制（显式提示或模型设计）未提升性能；2. GPT-4o无CoT提示时表现最佳；3. 高语言复杂度/低标注一致性场景中推理易引发过度思考；4. 系统1』式直觉预测更接近人类标注。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类任务中，快速直觉型决策优于慢速推理，挑战了LLM需更多推理的假设，对高风险金融领域应用LLM的提示策略设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SCALe基准测试，揭示当前大语言模型（LLMs）作为逻辑翻译器在词汇多样性场景下的不足，并通过MenTaL方法提升其翻译能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号方法依赖LLMs将自然语言转换为逻辑公式，但LLMs难以处理词汇多样性问题，而现有基准缺乏此类挑战，导致模型能力被高估。

Method: 提出SCALe基准（通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化生成数据集），并设计MenTaL方法（先构建统一表达表再翻译），结合上下文学习与监督微调提升模型表现。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs在词汇多样化文本的符号翻译任务中存在显著缺陷，而应用MenTaL方法后模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 词汇多样性是LLMs逻辑翻译的关键挑战，SCALe基准与MenTaL方法为评估和提升模型实际场景可靠性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于梯度匹配的演示选择方法，用于提升多示例上下文学习（ICL）的效果，通过对齐微调梯度选择示例，显著优于随机选择，并在多个大模型和数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多示例ICL依赖随机选择演示样本，但实例级检索不适用于多示例场景。作者假设上下文学习与微调的数据需求相似，需更优选择方法以逼近全量训练集的学习效果。

Method: 提出梯度匹配方法：通过对比目标任务全量训练集的微调梯度与候选示例的梯度，选择梯度方向最匹配的示例，使所选示例的学习效果接近全量数据。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B等大模型上，4-128示例场景中平均提升4%；5个闭源模型提升约2%，覆盖9个数据集且效果稳定。

Conclusion: 梯度匹配方法突破多示例ICL的演示选择瓶颈，为实际应用提供更优解决方案，证明对齐梯度方向可有效提升上下文学习可靠性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

TL;DR: 提出无需训练的模块化框架SUCEA，通过分解、迭代检索编辑和证据整合三步提升对抗性声明的自动事实核查效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统难以处理人为设计的对抗性声明，需改进证据检索与验证能力。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：1)声明分割与去语境化；2)迭代证据检索与子声明编辑；3)证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上，SUCEA显著提升检索和标签预测准确率，优于四个基于声明分解的基线模型。

Conclusion: SUCEA通过结构化处理流程有效应对对抗性声明，验证了模块化方法在事实核查任务中的优势。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学QA和图表多模态任务缺乏直接验证科学声明真实性的基准，需构建能系统性测试声明验证能力的评测体系。

Method: 通过自动提取科学文献中的支持声明，人工扰动生成矛盾声明，设计诊断任务分析模型在证据定位、多模态聚合等维度的能力。

Result: 主流视觉-语言模型F1值仅0.3-0.5，存在支持声明偏见；诊断显示模型难以定位证据、整合多模态信息及理解基础图表元素。

Conclusion: 当前模型在科学声明验证任务中存在显著缺陷，需提升多模态理解、细粒度推理及抗干扰能力以支持科学事实核查。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在自动语音识别（ASR）和自动语音翻译（AST）任务中生成的伪标签可能存在噪声，需借助LLM的知识修正标签以提高模型效果。

Method: 结合LLM对ASR/AST生成的伪标签进行校正，并通过数据过滤策略优化知识迁移效率，形成统一的半监督学习框架。

Result: 在普通话ASR任务中，WER绝对降低3.77%；西班牙语-英语AST任务中，Callhome和Fisher测试集的BLEU分数分别达34.0和64.7。

Conclusion: LESS框架验证了LLM在不同语言、任务及场景下的通用性，消融实验揭示了LLM知识迁移对语音处理应用的关键作用。

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如过程奖励模型或自我一致性）无法提供可验证证据，难以有效检测CoT中的幻觉，需更可靠的支持机制。

Method: 提出基于Lean 4的回顾性、步骤感知形式验证框架Safe，将推理步骤转化为形式化数学声明并提供证明，确保可验证性。

Result: 在多个模型和数学数据集上验证，性能显著提升，并创建包含30,809个形式化声明的FormalStep定理证明基准。

Conclusion: 首次将Lean 4用于验证LLM生成内容，为幻觉问题提供形式化基础，契合形式数学语言的设计初衷。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集仅覆盖计算机科学领域，非CS领域完全缺失，需构建跨领域评估基准。

Method: 构建含2700人工标注句对的跨领域数据集，使用预训练小/大语言模型建立基线，探索隐含科学NLI关系的训练数据增强。

Result: 最佳基线模型宏F1仅78.17%，显示显著改进空间；加入隐含关系句对可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED填补非CS领域科学NLI评估空白，验证了训练数据增强的有效性，为后续研究提供基准平台。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文提出ADAPT方法，通过提升生成多样性优化测试时扩展（TTS）效果，在数学推理任务中以更低计算成本达到高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法因推理优化模型输出多样性不足而受限，需通过增强生成多样性提升TTS效率。

Method: ADAPT采用轻量级前缀微调（prefix tuning）结合多样性导向的数据策略，动态调整模型生成过程。

Result: 实验显示ADAPT在数学推理任务中仅用1/8计算量即达到80%准确率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 生成多样性是TTS有效性的关键因素，ADAPT通过平衡多样性与计算效率为模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习建模创新者经验轨迹，发现主观视角多样性（非背景多样性）是预测未来创意组合成功的关键因素，并通过多领域数据与AI模拟验证了视角差异对创新成果的促进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有创新研究多关注社会结构的影响，但缺乏对个体经验轨迹如何塑造主观视角及创新机会的量化分析。本文旨在通过动态语言表征揭示创新者的认知空间，探索视角差异对创新成果的作用机制。

Method: 基于动态语言表征构建概念几何空间，量化创新者的主观视角；利用数百万科学家、发明家等多领域数据，结合自然实验和AI代理（大语言模型）模拟协作场景，分解视角多样性与背景多样性对创新的影响。

Result: 视角差异（合作者认知角距）始终正向预测创新成果，而经验背景差异则呈现负相关。AI模拟与实证数据一致显示，共同语言下融合异质经验轨迹的协作创新机制最有效。

Conclusion: 创新团队组建应优先考虑视角多样性而非背景多样性，研究政策需支持通过语言协同整合异质经验的协作模式，以提升跨领域创新效能。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种优化句子语义表示的静态词嵌入方法，通过预训练模型提取词嵌入后，结合主成分分析与知识蒸馏/对比学习进行改进，实现低成本高效的句子向量表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词嵌入在句子语义任务表现不足，且动态模型计算成本高。需在保持低推理成本的同时提升语义表示能力。

Method: 1. 从预训练句子Transformer提取词嵌入；2. 用句子级PCA优化；3. 结合知识蒸馏或对比学习；4. 推理时直接平均词嵌入生成句子向量。

Result: 在单语/跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集媲美SimCSE。分析显示成功去除语义无关成分并调整词向量权重。

Conclusion: 通过层次化优化策略，实现了高效且高质量的句子语义表示，为静态词嵌入的语义优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Tool-MVR，通过多智能体元验证和探索式反思学习，显著提升大语言模型的工具使用能力，减少API调用并增强错误纠正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型存在工具规划不可靠（如低质量指令导致API调用错误）和工具反思能力弱（超90%错误无法修正）两大问题，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 1. 多智能体元验证（MAMV）构建高质量工具指令数据集ToolBench-V；2. 探索式反思学习（EXPLORE）通过动态“错误→反思→修正”范式生成反思数据集ToolBench-R，并微调开源模型（如Qwen-7B）。

Result: 在StableToolBench上，Tool-MVR性能超越ToolLLM（+23.9%）和GPT-4（+15.3%），API调用减少31.4%；在RefineToolBench（首个工具反思评测基准）中，错误修正率达58.9%（ToolLLM仅9.1%）。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统性验证与动态反思学习，显著提升工具调用可靠性和错误修正能力，验证了其在复杂场景下的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种从原始视频自动生成视听语音识别（AVSR）数据集的高效方法，并以越南语为例构建基线模型，验证其在噪声环境中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统依赖纯音频特征，在噪声环境中表现不佳。AVSR因结合视觉信息而更鲁棒，但其发展受限于多语言（尤其是非英语）数据集的匮乏。自动数据收集是解决这一问题的潜在方案。

Method: 改进现有技术，提出从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，并以越南语为案例开发基线模型，验证方法的通用性。

Result: 自动收集的数据集支持构建强基线模型：在干净环境中与现有ASR竞争，在鸡尾酒会等噪声环境中显著优于纯音频模型。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，为将AVSR推广至资源稀缺语言（如越南语）提供了可行路径，尤其在噪声场景中展现应用潜力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化压缩Transformer模型的键值缓存，无需单独处理异常值，将内存占用降至27%且保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的键值（KV）缓存在长序列解码时内存需求急剧增长，现有量化方法仍需单独管理异常值，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展部署。

Method: 采用训练自由的KV缓存压缩方案：1) 根据层级误差敏感度自适应量化精度；2) 通过均值中心化消除异常值的单独处理需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将KV缓存内存占用降至16位基线的27%，在标准基准测试中保持可比准确率，且无需额外管理异常值。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的长上下文推理、复杂推理链等场景提供了可扩展的高效内存解决方案，推动了高性能推理的实用化进程。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Flex-TravelPlanner基准，用于评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活推理能力，发现现有模型在约束优先级处理和跨轮次适应方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM规划能力的基准主要关注静态单轮场景，无法反映现实规划问题中动态调整和约束竞争的复杂性，需建立更贴近实际的评估框架。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集扩展，新增两种评估模式：(1)多轮次顺序约束引入；(2)带明确优先级的竞争约束场景，测试GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B模型表现。

Result: 模型单轮表现无法预测多轮适应能力；约束引入顺序显著影响结果；模型常错误优先处理新低优先级约束而非现有高优先级约束。

Conclusion: 动态规划评估对LLM能力检验至关重要，需改进模型在约束优先级处理和跨轮次推理方面的能力，研究结果为复杂任务优化提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）的价值对齐策略存在根本性不足，仅强化表面行为倾向而缺乏规范推理能力，导致易受对抗攻击。借鉴人类道德心理学，研究揭示现有方法无法解决深层漏洞，需重新思考AI安全与监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs对齐策略（如基于人类偏好的微调）虽强调无害性、诚实性等规范，但无法抵御利用规范冲突的对抗攻击，暴露安全风险。研究旨在揭示其根本性缺陷并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过对比人类道德心理学中的规范性推理机制，分析LLMs在检测和解决规范冲突上的能力缺陷，并结合对抗攻击案例验证现有对齐方法的脆弱性。

Result: LLMs缺乏深层次规范推理能力，即使引入推理优化仍无法有效抵御对抗攻击。现有对齐方法仅塑造表面行为，无法实现真正的价值内化。

Conclusion: 当前“浅层对齐”方法不足以应对高能力AI系统的潜在风险，需开发具备规范性反思能力的模型，并推动更严格的AI安全监管框架。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

Method: 构建多模态基准MMRefine，包含六种场景和六类错误类型，通过对比细化前后表现，全面评估MLLMs的错误检测、修正及推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前开放和闭源MLLMs在细化过程中存在性能瓶颈，错误类型处理不均衡，且细化策略对结果影响显著。

Conclusion: MMRefine揭示了MLLMs在错误修正中的关键问题，为提升模型推理能力提供方向，其开源数据与框架可支持后续研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: STAND提出一种基于随机自适应N-gram草拟的无模型推测解码方法，通过利用推理轨迹冗余性，在保持精度的同时将推理延迟降低60-65%，且无需额外训练即可应用于现有语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理加速技术(如best-of-N采样)存在计算资源消耗大、性能与效率难以平衡的问题。研究发现推理路径常重复使用相似模式，这为无模型加速提供了可能性。

Method: 结合随机草拟策略与内存高效的logit基N-gram模块，保留概率信息；采用优化的Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动树结构，提升token接受率。

Result: 在AIME-2024等基准测试中，相比自回归解码延迟降低60-65%，吞吐量优于现有推测解码方法14-28%，单轨迹场景仍可实现48-58%延迟降低。

Conclusion: STAND作为即插即用方案，通过有效利用推理冗余模式，在无需模型修改或训练的情况下，实现了效率与精度的最优平衡，成为通用推理加速解决方案。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT提出一种多LLM竞争对齐算法，通过模型间对抗与集体评估实现自我进化，提升生成多样性和任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一LLM存在生成多样性不足和评估偏差问题，需通过多模型协作竞争机制弥补这些缺陷。

Method: 构建'斯巴达部落'：每次迭代随机选择指令和两个模型对决，其他模型通过改进的Elo信誉系统评估结果，胜败方权重动态调整，生成偏好对供所有模型学习。

Result: 在12个任务中的10个超越基线模型，平均提升7%；模型在未见任务上泛化更强，输出更逻辑、直接且信息丰富。

Conclusion: 集体竞争机制有效促进LLM自我进化，利用模型间专业多样性提升综合性能，验证了去中心化对齐策略的优越性。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

TL;DR: 现有MLLM评估基准忽视人文社科（HSS）需求，本文提出跨语言基准HSSBench，揭示主流模型在跨学科推理与知识整合上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）评估基准过度关注STEM领域的纵向推理，缺乏对人文社科（HSS）横向跨学科思维及抽象概念与视觉关联能力的针对性测试。

Method: 构建HSS六类任务的HSSBench基准，含超13,000个多语言样本；通过领域专家与自动化代理协作生成数据，并设计迭代优化流程确保样本质量。

Result: 对20余个主流MLLM的测试表明，即使最先进模型在HSS任务中仍面临显著挑战，尤其在跨领域知识内化与连接方面表现不足。

Conclusion: HSSBench为MLLM的跨学科推理能力评估提供新方向，未来需加强模型在抽象概念与多领域知识融合方面的研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [42] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）在科学写作修订评估中存在局限，本文提出结合LLM评判与领域特定指标的混合方法能更可靠评估修订质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本修订评估指标过度关注文本相似性，无法有效衡量修订带来的实质性改进，需探索更符合人类判断的评估方法。

Method: 通过人工标注研究分析修订质量，探索无参考评估指标，并测试LLM作为评判者的能力（含/无黄金参考标准）。

Result: LLM擅长评估指令遵循性但正确性不足，领域特定指标提供补充视角，混合方法评估效果最优。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评判与任务专用指标的混合评估框架，能最可靠地评估科学文本修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

### [43] [Fine-Grained Interpretation of Political Opinions in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04774)
*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种多维度政治学习框架，通过可解释的表征工程技术学习细粒度政治概念向量，解决LLM政治分析中单轴概念偏差及内部意图不透明问题，实验验证其解耦、检测与干预能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖LLM开放回答评估政治倾向，但其回应与内部意图存在偏差，且单轴分析易导致概念混淆，需开发多维度透明分析方法。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架并构建对应数据集，采用三种表征工程技术学习政治概念向量，用于检测和干预LLM内部状态。

Result: 在8个开源LLM上的实验表明，所获向量能解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证语义有效性且OOD泛化性强，干预实验可调控生成内容政治倾向。

Conclusion: 多维度表征工程能有效揭示LLM内部政治状态，提供透明分析工具，为模型政治立场检测与干预提供新方法。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为MMSU的综合基准测试，用于评估语音大语言模型在自然语音理解中的细粒度感知与复杂推理能力，发现现有模型仍有显著改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型（SpeechLLMs）在音频处理方面表现优异，但其对自然语音中语义、副语言特征及语音学特征的细粒度感知与复杂推理能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建包含5,000个音频-问题-答案三元组的MMSU基准测试，覆盖47个任务，并系统整合语音学、韵律、修辞、句法、语义和副语言学等多层次语言现象。

Result: 通过对14个先进语音大模型的评估，发现现有模型在细粒度感知和复杂推理任务中存在明显不足，为未来优化指明方向。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解的综合评估设立新标准，为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供理论支持与实践指导。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏对多模态输入如何与语言主干整合的系统性分析，需填补这一空白以指导更鲁棒的整合策略开发。

Method: 提出LLM-centric分类框架：1) 模态整合的架构策略（机制与融合层次）；2) 联合/坐标表示学习技术；3) 训练范式（策略与目标函数）。基于125个MLLMs进行模式分析。

Result: 通过分析2021-2025年的125个模型，揭示了当前整合技术的新兴模式，提出的分类法为研究者提供了结构化技术概览。

Conclusion: 该分类框架系统化梳理多模态整合方法，为基于预训练基础模型的未来MLLMs开发提供关键见解与方向指引。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑推理基准仅关注最终答案准确性，缺乏对推理过程质量与结构的评估，需更全面、可解释的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架（三评估维度：整体准确率、步骤合理性、表示层对齐），构建四种监督风格（自然语言+符号变体）进行微调实验，并通过表示层探测分析推理行为。

Result: 自然语言监督在分布外/长上下文任务中泛化性强；符号监督使推理链更结构化；微调主要通过逐步生成而非捷径预测提升推理能力。

Conclusion: FineLogic框架为LLM逻辑推理评估提供更严谨、可解释的视角，不同监督格式互补，可针对性优化推理质量与结构。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合CNN与BERT的混合模型，用于机器翻译校对，通过端到端训练实现错误检测与修正，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译常存在错误需人工修正，现有校对技术效果有限。为提高校对质量，需开发能有效捕捉语义错误并保持原意的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部n-gram特征，BERT捕捉上下文语义，结合注意力机制检测词序/缺失错误，并利用GRU解码器与翻译记忆库进行修正。基于WMT和Open-Subtitles双语语料进行端到端多任务训练。

Result: 实验达到90%准确率、89.37% F1值与16.24% MSE，整体性能超越现有技术10%以上，在误译识别与连贯修正方面达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该混合模型通过联合语义特征提取与上下文建模，显著提升校对效果，证明CNN+BERT架构在翻译后编辑任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了视觉语言模型（VLM）和大型语言模型（LLM）在印尼四年级学生手写考试答案的自动评分与反馈生成中的表现，发现VLM因手写识别误差影响LLM评分准确性，但生成的反馈仍具部分实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂（尤其是教育资源匮乏地区）中教育评估任务的实际效果，填补现有研究在欠代表教育场景中的空白。

Method: 使用646份印尼四年级学生手写考试答案（含14K+答案，覆盖数学、英语两科），测试VLM与多个LLM在自动评分和个性化反馈生成任务中的表现。

Result: VLM手写识别准确率不足导致LLM评分误差传播，但基于不完美输入生成的反馈仍保留部分实用价值；个性化与情境相关性存在明显缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前VLM/LLM在教育评估中应用受限于手写识别能力，但在资源匮乏场景下反馈生成功能仍具潜力，需进一步优化模型鲁棒性及情境理解能力。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索包含答案定义与字谜验证机制，传统方法依赖交叉词验证。该研究旨在构建可独立验证答案正确性的自动化系统，解决现有方法对人工验证的依赖。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：(1)生成假设答案；(2)提出字谜解释；(3)基于编码化推理步骤的验证系统。系统完全由开源组件构建，最终解决方案通过Python代码表达可解释的验证逻辑。

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集(含英国泰晤士报/每日电讯报线索)上达到SOTA性能，且所有被验证的答案均提供可追溯的字谜推理过程。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM生成与形式化验证步骤，该系统不仅提升了解题性能，还实现了人类可审查的推理过程，为复杂语言任务的可解释求解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

TL;DR: 提出RACE框架，通过分析推理链的四个信号检测大型推理模型中的幻觉问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法仅关注答案层面的不确定性，无法有效识别大型推理模型（LRMs）因冗余或逻辑不一致的推理链导致的幻觉问题。

Method: RACE框架提取关键推理步骤，计算四个诊断信号：推理链的样本间一致性、基于熵的答案不确定性、推理与答案的语义对齐性、推理内部连贯性。

Result: 实验表明RACE在多个数据集和不同大语言模型上优于现有基线，即使答案正确仍能实现细粒度幻觉检测，代码已开源。

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs提供了一种鲁棒且通用的幻觉检测方案，通过联合分析推理与答案的一致性提升模型透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平行语料库及对齐算法无法有效建模同声传译中语音段的长程交互及特定差异（如简化、功能泛化），需专用数据集与工具。

Method: 收集学生模拟会议数据集MockConf，含5种欧洲语言的7小时语音转录；开发基于Web的跨词/跨句对齐工具InterAlign，并提出自动对齐基线方法。

Result: 发布包含词/跨句对齐的MockConf数据集及InterAlign工具，提供评估指标与自动对齐基线。

Conclusion: MockConf与InterAlign填补了同声传译自动分析工具的空白，为研究动态传译过程提供资源支持。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Motivation: 人工生成多选题耗时耗力，而大语言模型（LLMs）具备解决此问题的潜力。研究旨在探索LLMs在教育评估中的新应用可能性。

Method: 通过向模型提示中注入知识以减少幻觉，控制测试源文本，并邀请21名教育工作者对三种LLMs生成的MCQs进行效果评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在多项指标中表现最优，但实验同时揭示了教育工作者对AI技术应用仍存在一定抵触情绪。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是GPT-3.5）可有效生成高质量MCQs，但需进一步推动AI技术在教育领域的接受度，该研究为未来教育工具开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了不同提示策略、少样本示例数量及选择对大型语言模型在等长机器翻译任务中表现的影响，发现指令与示例对齐对长度控制至关重要，多输出选择可优化质量与长度的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在IWSLT等长翻译任务中，不同规模的开源大语言模型如何通过提示策略、少样本示例数量及选择实现翻译质量与输出长度的有效控制。

Method: 使用8个不同规模的开源LLM，在En→De/Fr/Es语言对中测试指令措辞、少样本示例数量（5/10/20-shot）及极端/等长示例选择对翻译的影响，并分析多输出选择策略。

Result: 指令与示例属性一致时能控制输出，极端示例使翻译更短而等长示例易忽略长度限制；少样本提升质量但边际效益递减；多输出选择显著改善质量-长度权衡，部分语言对达SOTA。

Conclusion: 指令-示例对齐是长度控制关键，少样本对质量提升有限，多输出策略可突破单次生成限制，为等长翻译任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管UD被广泛认为是跨语言句法表示最成功的框架，但其实际有效性尚未充分探索。本文旨在验证UD是否能提升预训练模型在跨语言任务中的表现。

Method: 将UD整合至预训练语言模型，并在跨语言对抗性复述识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD使准确率和F1分数平均提升3.85%和6.08%，缩小了预训练模型与大型语言模型的性能差距，部分语言对甚至超越后者。UD与英语的相似度分数与模型性能呈正相关。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中展现出有效性及潜力，其语言相似度的相关性为跨语言模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如LiveCodeBench、CodeElo）和评估指标（如Pass@K）无法有效衡量大语言模型在真实竞赛场景下的编码能力及反思能力。

Method: 构建包含118个ICPC竞赛题目的基准，提供真实竞赛场景、本地评测工具及Refine@K迭代修复指标，支持基于执行反馈的解决方案优化。

Result: 顶尖模型（如DeepSeek-R1）需多轮代码反馈才能释放推理能力，且当前模型仍显著落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力评估仍具挑战性，现有模型在代码生成领域虽进步明显，但尚未达到人类顶尖水平。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

### [56] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Verbose ListOps基准，揭示大语言模型在嵌套叙事推理中的状态管理缺陷。现有基准无法有效测试该问题，而新基准通过将ListOps转化为长故事，控制叙事长度与推理难度，暴露模型在中等上下文下的性能崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文与多跳QA基准缺乏真实干扰项，且未分离上下文长度与推理复杂度，掩盖了大语言模型在嵌套叙事推理中的根本局限。

Method: 通过程序化将ListOps计算转换为长连贯故事，强制模型进行内部状态管理，并精细控制叙事长度与推理难度，同时隐藏中间结果以突出嵌套推理挑战。

Result: 主流大模型（如GPT-4、Gemini 2.5 Pro）在约10k token的叙事长度下性能崩溃，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps方程，暴露其状态管理与干扰信息过滤的缺陷。

Conclusion: 仅扩展上下文窗口不足解决嵌套推理问题，需针对性增强模型的关键推理点识别、中间结果跟踪及干扰过滤能力，Verbose ListOps为此提供了可扩展的评估框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了现有观点，提出结合混合HMM与自监督模型的方法在低资源语言ASR任务中优于微调多语言端到端模型，并在苏格兰盖尔语上实现32%相对WER降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑当前主流观点——即微调多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR的最佳方案，探索在原始训练数据未包含目标语言时，如何更高效利用有限数据提升性能。

Method: 结合混合隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)与自监督模型，通过持续自监督预训练和半监督训练策略，充分利用所有可用语音和文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语ASR任务中，相较最佳微调Whisper模型，词错误率(WER)相对降低32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM+自监督模型的方法在低资源场景下显著优于单纯微调方案，证明综合利用多模态数据训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言数学推理任务中提供教学反馈的效果，发现母语对齐的反馈能显著提升低资源语言学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未充分验证LLMs在非英语语言（尤其是数学推理任务）中的教学支持能力，需探索多语言反馈对学习效果的实际影响。

Method: 通过模拟多语言师生互动，使用强模型生成提示（11种语言），弱模型模拟学生，测试352种实验组合，分析语言、模型和资源水平对学习效果的影响。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其在低资源语言中，学生母语与反馈语言一致时效果最佳。

Conclusion: 开发多语言LLM教育工具时，需优先考虑母语对齐的反馈策略，以兼顾有效性与包容性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Conclusion: 上下文信息（视觉/文本元数据显著提升领域特定机器翻译性能，公开数据集ConECT可支持后续研究。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

high-quality English translation, we analyze LLMs' problem-solving
capabilities, consistency, and multilingual performance. Our empirical study
reveals that the most recent models not only achieve scores comparable to
top-performing students but also demonstrate robust reasoning skills on
complex, multi-step algorithmic challenges, even though difficulties remain
with graph-based tasks. Building on these findings, we explore the potential of
LLMs to support educational environments through the generation of high-quality
editorial content, offering instructors a powerful tool to enhance student

Motivation: 解决特定领域自动语音识别(ASR)模型在标注数据稀缺时，如何有效利用未标注音频和相关领域标注数据进行优化的挑战。

Method: 1. 融合域内小规模标注集与相关领域辅助数据
2. 采用多模型共识/NER过滤策略迭代优化伪标签
3. 设计增量式训练流程延缓性能饱和

Result: 在Wow和Fisher语料库上：
- 共识过滤相对单步微调提升22.3%/24.8%
- NER作为次优方案实现相近效果但计算成本更低
- 辅助数据带来4%基础性能增益

Conclusion: 多模型共识过滤在性能提升方面最优，NER在计算效率与性能间取得最佳平衡，验证了半监督框架在跨领域ASR适配中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本长度控制方法常需复杂模型调整，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。本文旨在开发一种通用、轻量的解决方案。

Method: 在交叉熵损失计算中增强EOS令牌预测的重要性，该方法与模型架构、解码算法解耦，且可与其他推理阶段长度控制技术叠加使用。

Result: 在编码器-解码器及GPT类大语言模型上的实验表明，该方法能有效控制生成文本长度，且多数情况下不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 所提方法实现了无需复杂模型修改的通用长度控制，为不同文本生成任务提供了灵活的长度调节方案。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Conclusion: AR-Checker通过动态生成领域无关的测试用例，为LLM鲁棒性评估提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Motivation: 现有LLM评测缺乏对辩论演讲多层面理解能力（如论点强度、结构连贯性等）的系统评估，需构建新基准以探索此类认知能力。

Method: 使用600+人工标注的辩论演讲数据集，分析前沿LLM与人类评委的表现差异，并测试模型生成说服性演讲的能力。

Conclusion: LLM在辩论评估任务中展现潜力，但与人类评委存在系统性差异，需进一步研究模型的多维度认知能力。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 研究LLMs的自我报告是否具有类似人类内省的特性，尤其在语言流畅性和认知能力提升的背景下，如何解读此类报告与意识的关系。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个具体自我报告案例：描述自身创作过程和推断温度参数，分别评估其是否符合内省的定义。

Result: 第一个案例不构成有效内省，第二个案例可视为无意识的最小内省行为。

Conclusion: LLMs的自我报告可能体现初步内省能力，但缺乏意识伴随，需谨慎将其与人类内省类比。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 现有基于RLHF的翻译方法在口语化字幕任务中表现不佳，主要由于离线奖励模型与在线LLM的分布偏移导致训练结果不理想，需针对性解决。

Method: 提出RIVAL对抗训练框架，将奖励模型与LLM建模为极小极大博弈，迭代优化两者：RM学习区分翻译质量（定性偏好奖励），LLM提升翻译以缩小差距，并引入BLEU等定量指标增强稳定性与泛化性。

Result: 实验表明，RIVAL框架显著优于基线翻译模型，验证了对抗训练及混合奖励机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过对抗训练协调奖励模型与LLM的动态优化，结合定性与定量奖励，能有效缓解分布偏移问题，提升口语翻译质量，为LLM的翻译优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型难以捕捉社交媒体中隐晦的自残表达（如非正式语言与表情符号组合），导致自残意图检测效果受限，亟需通过上下文关联提升模型对模糊信号的解析能力。

Method: 1. CESM-100提供上下文表情符号映射；2. 构建SHINES数据集标注自残标签、随意提及(CM)与严重意图(SI)；3. 设计多任务框架：主任务检测自残，辅助任务定位CM/SI范围；4. 生成可解释预测依据。

Result: 在Llama 3等三个LLM上的实验表明，该方法在零样本/少样本/微调场景下均显著提升自残检测性能（F1值）与预测可解释性，有效缓解语义模糊问题。

Conclusion: 通过表情符号上下文关联与意图分层标注，模型能更精准识别自风险信号。公开数据集与框架为后续研究提供基准，推动社交媒体心理危机干预技术发展。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,

suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出基于图像和多模态AI的框架，分析中国哈尔滨街道特征（车辆停放、绿化、清洁度、宽度）对商业活力及用户满意度的影响，发现适度车辆可提升可达性，但过度停车与狭窄街道会降低步行友好性，绿化和清洁显著提升满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究城市社区街道商业活力与车辆可达性、环境质量及行人感知间的复杂关系，填补传统方法在非线性、情境敏感性分析上的不足，为社区振兴提供数据支持。

Method: 结合街景图像、多模态大模型VisualGLM-6B和GPT-4感知建模，从美团/大众点评数据构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），分析其与空间特征（停车密度、绿化、清洁度、街道宽度）的关联。

Result: 1) 狭窄街道过度停车显著降低步行友好性与店铺定价；2) 绿化和清洁度高的街道满意度更高，但与定价关联弱；3) 街道宽度调节车辆影响，空间配置至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究验证多模态AI与形态分析结合在商业活力诊断中的价值，强调车辆活动的条件性作用，为城市设计、停车管理及社区更新提供可扩展工具，推动理论与方法创新。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出结合对比学习与隐式立场推理的CL-ISR框架，通过增强语义差异捕捉和立场倾向分析，显著提升社交媒体误导文本检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体误导文本易引发公众误解、社会恐慌及经济损失，需开发更精准的识别方法以应对语言复杂性及立场操纵问题。

Method: CL-ISR框架整合对比学习算法（构建正负样本对增强语义差异学习）与隐式立场推理模块（挖掘文本潜在立场倾向及其与主题关联）。

Result: 该框架通过对比学习的判别力与立场推理的深度解析，在复杂语言场景中显著提升误导文本检测准确率。

Conclusion: CL-ISR有效结合两种算法优势，为检测立场偏移型或情感操纵型误导内容提供兼具判别性与解释性的解决方案。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BERT模型依赖ASR转录文本丢失语音韵律信息，而wav2vec 2.0缺乏语义解释性，需整合多模态特征以克服单模态局限。

Method: 通过分数融合策略整合wav2vec 2.0的声学特征建模能力与Phi-4多模态大语言模型的语义理解能力。

Result: 官方测试集RMSE达0.375，优于第三名(0.384)和基线(0.444)，仅次于第一名(0.364)位列竞赛第二名。

Conclusion: 跨模态融合策略有效平衡声学与语义特征，验证了多模态方法在口语能力评估中的优越性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出DiCoRe框架，通过发散-收敛推理和LLM验证提升零样本事件检测性能，实验显示F1提升4-7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在零样本事件检测中存在局限性，难以处理复杂事件本体、领域特定触发词提取及结构化问题，导致其实际应用受限。

Method: DiCoRe框架包含Dreamer（发散推理促进开放事件发现）和Grounder（收敛推理通过有限状态机约束解码对齐任务指令），并引入LLM-Judge验证输出精度。

Result: 在5个领域6个数据集和9个LLM上的实验表明，DiCoRe平均F1值超过最佳基线4-7%，成为当前最优零样本事件检测框架。

Conclusion: 通过解耦发散-收敛任务流程，DiCoRe有效平衡事件覆盖率和检测精度，验证了框架在零样本场景下的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏置是否与人类语言处理约束一致，解决长期存在的理论争议。

Method: 引入信息论指标m-局部熵，通过平均有损上下文惊异度量化语言歧义性，并在扰动自然语言和PFSA生成语言上进行实验。

Result: Transformer和LSTM模型在m-局部熵更高的语言上表现更差，证明模型学习难度与局部统计结构直接相关。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类共享对局部统计模式的敏感性，为理解模型归纳偏置提供了可计算的理论框架。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解LALMs的内部机制对解释其行为及提升性能至关重要，但此前缺乏对其听觉属性处理机制的系统分析。

Method: 通过在三款先进LALMs上应用词汇投影技术，追踪听觉属性信息在模型各层及标记位置的动态演变过程。

Result: 发现识别失败时属性信息随层深递减；早期层成功解析属性与高准确率相关；模型依赖直接查询输入而非聚合隐藏状态信息。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LALMs处理听觉属性的关键模式，提出的增强方法验证了分析的有效性，为未来模型优化提供了理论依据和技术路径。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）对图像描述中语义错误严重性的评估差异，发现LLMs在性别和颜色错误判断上与人类存在显著偏差，仅个别模型部分接近人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为自动评估工具在自然语言生成任务中是否能够准确复现人类对错误严重性的判断，尤其是不同错误类型（如性别、颜色）的敏感性差异。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人（2020）的实验框架，在单模态（纯文本）和多模态（文本+图像）场景下，控制生成年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色四类语义错误，系统对比人类与多种LLM的评估结果。

Result: 人类对颜色和类型错误在视觉上下文中的严重性感知显著增强，而多数LLM对性别错误评分低但对颜色错误评分过高。仅Doubao模型接近人类错误严重性排序，但区分度不足；单模态模型DeepSeek-V3在跨模态条件下与人类判断对齐最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs可能因内化社会规范而抑制性别错误评分，但缺乏人类颜色感知的神经机制基础。模型设计（如DeepSeek-V3）可能比多模态输入更关键地影响与人类判断的对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）系统过度依赖检索结果，易受不准确上下文干扰且忽视模型固有知识，导致处理误导或信息过载时性能下降。

Method: 设计Knowledgeable-r1框架，结合联合采样和多策略知识能力探索机制，促进模型自主平衡参数化知识与上下文知识的利用。

Result: 在参数/上下文冲突任务和常规RAG任务中，模型推理准确率显著提升，反事实场景下性能超越基线17.07%，且各任务表现持续改进。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决RAG系统知识利用失衡问题，验证了激发模型自主知识整合机制对提升推理鲁棒性的关键作用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在社会、人口统计和性别偏见，但其内部结构如何表征这些偏见尚不明确。研究旨在揭示偏见的机制化表达及干预影响。

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，通过不同指标识别模型内部导致偏见的边（edges），并系统性评估其稳定性、定位和跨数据集/语言的泛化性。

Result: 偏见计算高度集中在少数层；微调会改变偏见相关组件（即使任务与偏见无关）；移除这些组件虽减少偏见，但会损害命名实体识别等任务性能。

Conclusion: 模型偏见通过局部化结构表征，且与其他任务共享关键组件，表明偏见干预需权衡任务性能，避免单一化处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）的上下文压缩方法未有效过滤非证据信息，导致大语言模型（LLM）性能受限。

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在ODQA任务中性能优于现有方法，同时减少延迟和token消耗，具有高成本效益。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过证据性导向的压缩与动态检索机制，在提升LLM问答性能的同时实现了高效资源利用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: 研究者提出RELIC框架，通过形式语法生成的语言识别任务评估大语言模型（LLM）的指令跟随能力，发现即使先进模型在复杂语法任务中表现接近随机猜测，且随着任务难度增加，模型转向依赖浅层启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以动态调整任务复杂度且易受数据污染，需一种新框架测试LLM仅基于上下文指令（无输入输出示例）执行任务的能力，尤其是组合多个上下文指令（语法规则）的能力。

Method: 引入RELIC框架，利用合成语言的形式语法生成语言识别任务，自动生成实例以避免数据污染，并通过调整语法复杂度动态提升任务难度，分析模型在组合指令时的表现。

Result: 模型准确率与语法及样本复杂度强相关，当前最先进LLM在复杂语法任务中表现接近随机水平；任务难度增加时，模型放弃遵循复杂指令，转而依赖浅层启发式策略。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在组合复杂指令完成任务时存在显著局限，RELIC框架可有效诊断模型推理机制，揭示其依赖启发式方法而非严格遵循指令的倾向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

TL;DR: 研究者构建了一个8TB的开放许可文本数据集Common Pile v0.1，并训练出性能与未授权数据模型相当的7B参数LLM，以解决版权和伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练依赖大量未授权文本，存在知识产权和伦理风险，而现有开放数据集规模小、质量低，无法支撑高性能模型。

Method: 收集并整合30个开放许可来源的多样化文本（如论文、代码、书籍等），构建8TB数据集Common Pile，并基于此训练两个7B参数模型（1T和2T tokens）。

Result: 训练的Comma v0.1模型在同等算力下性能接近Llama 1/2 7B，验证了开放数据训练LLM的可行性。

Conclusion: Common Pile数据集及配套模型的开源为合法合规的LLM开发提供了新路径，证明开放数据可替代未授权数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自监督辅助任务在极低资源语言的形态屈折任务中表现分析：自动编码在数据稀缺时最优，字符掩码语言模型(CMLM)随数据量增加更有效，基于语素边界的掩码策略持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对全球多数语言标注数据稀缺的问题，探索自监督学习在字符级形态屈折任务中的潜力，该任务对语言文档化至关重要但现有研究不足。

Method: 在19种低资源语言上训练编码器-解码器Transformer模型，评估13种自监督辅助目标（包括自动编码/CMLM等），并引入基于已知语素边界的掩码采样策略。

Result: 数据极稀缺时自动编码最优，数据增加后CMLM更有效；强归纳偏置目标对预测有直观影响但性能不优于CMLM；基于语素边界的掩码策略持续提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 结合语言结构先验知识（如语素边界）的自监督方法为低资源形态建模提供了新方向，数据规模与任务选择存在动态关联关系。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

*Ratna Kandala,Prakash Mondal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法优势的统一数学推导系统，用于分析自然语言中的连续与不连续结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法理论（如PSG、DG、CG）对不连续结构的分析相互独立且缺乏统一框架，需整合不同理论的核心特征以解决此问题。

Method: 通过融合短语结构语法的构成性、依存语法的中心-依存关系及范畴语法的函子-论元关系，构建跨理论统一表示系统。

Result: 证明该统一系统能同时处理连续与不连续结构，为不同语法框架的收敛性分析提供数学基础。

Conclusion: 整合多语法理论核心要素的数学推导方法，为自然语言结构分析开辟了跨框架统一表征的新路径。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种系统化推理框架，通过分解声明、子声明归因与蕴含分类的三步流程，提升大语言模型在幻觉检测任务中的细粒度判断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NLI的幻觉检测方法依赖LLMs直接分类，但复杂推理任务中缺乏显式结构化推理可能导致性能受限。

Method: 设计三步推理流程：(1)声明分解为子事实，(2)逐项溯源验证子声明蕴含关系，(3)聚合中间结果进行最终分类。

Result: 实验表明引导式推理显著提高检测准确率，并通过中间步骤质量指标验证了推理过程有效性的提升。

Conclusion: 结构化推理机制能增强LLMs的细粒度分析能力，为幻觉检测及复杂NLI任务提供可解释性更强的解决方案。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

*Nan Huo,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Ge Qu,Xiaolong Li,Xiaodong Li,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间自动分解知识源以解决RAG系统中的知识冲突问题，显著提升QA任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在处理知识冲突时，直接对比不同知识源会导致LLM因上下文冗杂而难以识别矛盾。现有方法无法有效解决这一问题，亟需更细粒度的处理机制。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架：构建分层动作空间，自动感知上下文复杂度，将知识源拆解为细粒度比较步骤，通过可操作化步骤实现深层推理。

Result: 在5个基准数据集和3种冲突类型上，QA准确率全面超越现有方法（尤其在时间/语义冲突类型中），且非冲突问题表现稳健。

Conclusion: Micro-Act通过自适应知识分解有效缓解知识冲突，兼具冲突与非冲突场景的鲁棒性，具备实际RAG应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

TL;DR: ProRefine提出了一种基于大模型文本反馈的动态提示优化方法，无需额外训练数据或标注即可提升多智能体协作工作流的推理性能，使小模型达到大模型水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体协作工作流因提示设计不当导致错误传播和性能低下，限制了系统的可靠性和扩展性。需要开发无需训练数据的实时优化方法。

Method: ProRefine通过大模型生成的文本反馈，在推理时动态优化多步推理任务的提示模板，无需额外训练或真实标签支持。

Result: 在5个数学推理基准测试中，ProRefine显著超越零样本思维链基线3-37个百分点，并使小模型达到与大模型相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提示优化同时提升准确性和模型效率，为可扩展的AI部署和降低高性能AI使用门槛提供了新路径。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于约束优化的大语言模型遗忘方法，通过logit-margin flattening损失强制遗忘敏感信息，并利用对偶算法动态平衡遗忘与保留目标，在TOFU和MUSE基准上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法将遗忘与保留目标合并为标量损失函数，导致优化不稳定和保留数据性能下降，尤其在激进遗忘场景下问题显著。

Method: 将遗忘建模为约束优化问题：使用softmax-free的logit-margin扁平化损失驱动遗忘集输出均匀分布，同时在保留集上施加硬约束，采用可扩展的对偶算法动态调节权衡系数。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法在多种LLM架构上均达到或超越SOTA基线，有效移除目标信息的同时保持下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过约束优化框架与数值稳定的损失设计，实现了更鲁棒的LLM信息遗忘机制，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Search Arena，一个包含24,000多对多轮交互的大规模人类偏好数据集，用于分析搜索增强语言模型。研究发现用户偏好受引用数量及来源影响，且网络搜索在非搜索场景中可能提升模型表现，但过度依赖参数知识会降低搜索场景质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强语言模型分析受限于小规模、单轮静态问答数据集，难以全面评估系统表现。需构建更贴近真实场景的多轮、多样化数据集以深入分析用户偏好与系统行为。

Method: 通过众包构建Search Arena数据集，覆盖多语言和用户意图，包含12,000个人类偏好投票及完整交互痕迹。采用跨领域分析方法，测试搜索增强模型在通用对话环境与传统模型在搜索密集场景的表现。

Result: 用户偏好与引用数量正相关（即使引用无关），社区平台来源更受青睐，静态百科可靠性存疑。网络搜索在非搜索场景中无损性能，但仅依赖参数知识的模型在搜索场景表现显著下降。

Conclusion: Search Arena为搜索增强模型研究提供基准资源，用户感知可信度与实际支持证据存在偏差，需平衡搜索引用与模型知识。开源数据集促进该领域研究发展。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在偏好评估中存在系统性偏差，过度依赖表面特征（如长度、行话等），导致评估不可靠。本文提出基于反事实数据增强的后训练方法，有效减少偏差并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型作为人类偏好的代理存在校准错误，其偏好判断过度依赖表面模式而非实质质量，导致奖励破解和评估不可靠。这些偏差源于训练数据中的伪影，需系统性研究并解决。

Method: 通过控制反事实对比样本，量化偏好模型对偏差特征的偏好程度，并提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的微调方法，使用合成对比样本进行针对性去偏。

Result: CDA方法使平均校准错误从39.4%降至32.5%，绝对偏差差从20.5%降至10.0%，同时保持RewardBench整体性能，模型对虚假线索的依赖显著降低。

Conclusion: 训练数据偏差导致模型偏好与人类偏好显著偏离，但通过针对性去偏方法（如CDA）可有效构建可靠偏好模型，证明后训练修正的可行性。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写被过滤的低质量网页文本生成合成数据，有效提升大模型预训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练数据受限于高质量自然文本的稀缺性（过滤后仅保留1%），且网络数据增长速度无法匹配算力需求，需解决数据扩展瓶颈。

Method: REWIRE方法对过滤流程中被丢弃的低质量文档进行引导式改写（guided rewrite），将其转化为可用训练数据，增加合成数据在预训练集中的占比。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B模型上，混合原始数据与改写数据使22项任务平均提升1.0-2.5个百分点，效果优于仅用过滤数据或双倍原始数据，且82%改写数据来自原被丢弃文本。

Conclusion: 回收低质量网页文本的改写策略能有效突破预训练数据规模限制，其效果优于问答生成、知识提取等其他合成数据方法，为数据扩展提供新方向。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: ProLoRA提出了一种无需额外训练数据、通过投影源模型低秩调整参数到目标模型权重空间的零样本迁移方法，解决了传统方法切换基础模型需重新训练的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数高效微调方法在切换基础模型时需重新训练，而实际场景常面临数据获取困难。ProLoRA旨在实现无需数据与重训练的跨模型知识迁移。

Method: 通过分析子空间与零空间相似性，选择性地将源模型的LoRA调整参数投影到目标模型对应层的权重空间，实现参数迁移。

Result: 在主流文生图模型上的实验表明，ProLoRA成功迁移知识且性能与常规训练方法相当，验证了零样本迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: ProLoRA突破了传统参数高效微调对数据与重训练的依赖，为跨模型参数迁移提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主代理代表用户决策的时代，如何在不同任务中合理共享信息（即保持上下文完整性）成为关键问题。研究认为代理需具备对操作环境的推理能力以实现这一目标。

Method: 1. 要求大语言模型(LLM)在信息披露时显式进行上下文完整性推理；2. 开发强化学习框架进一步训练模型推理能力；3. 使用约700个包含多样化上下文与信息规范的人工合成数据集进行验证。

Result: 该方法显著减少了不恰当信息披露（平均降低约50%），同时保持任务性能。改进效果可迁移至人类标注的PrivacyLens等基准测试，验证了跨模型规模与架构的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合显式推理与强化学习的小规模训练能有效提升模型上下文完整性判断，且合成数据的改进可泛化至真实场景，为AI助手隐私保护提供了可扩展方案。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Result: 在Google Research Football、MAgent Battle和StarCraft II中，LLM-MARL的胜率、协调分数和零样本泛化能力均超过MAPPO和QMIX。消融实验证明子目标生成与语言通信对性能提升贡献显著，定性分析发现角色专业化等涌现行为。

Conclusion: 通过融合语言建模与策略学习，LLM-MARL为多智能体系统设计提供了新思路，可应用于游戏AI、人机协作等领域，为LLM在复杂交互系统中的部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG结合知识图谱与检索增强生成技术，解决大语言模型在可持续制造中的幻觉问题，提升循环经济决策的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在可持续制造中易生成错误的工业代码和排放因子，影响监管与投资决策，需增强输出的可靠性与可追溯性。

Method: 构建包含11.7万工业/废弃物实体及排放数据的领域知识图谱，通过SPARQL查询和多跳推理验证子图，实现结构化检索增强生成框架。

Result: 在单跳/多跳问答任务中，ROUGE-L F1达1.0（基线<0.08），响应时间减半且token使用减少16%，显著优于独立LLM和基础RAG。

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG为低碳资源决策提供可验证的监管级支持，推动可靠循环经济规划，解决大模型在工业领域的核心缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HADA提出了一种与协议和框架无关的参考架构，通过角色化代理（业务、数据科学、审计等）封装算法或LLM，使技术与非技术角色能以自然语言查询、调整、审计决策，确保组织目标与伦理对齐。实证表明其提升了准确性、透明度和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理与传统算法在组织目标、价值观对齐上的挑战，确保跨角色（业务、审计、伦理等）在战略、战术、实时决策中可协作控制，并实现透明化与伦理约束的持续追踪。

Method: 1. 设计协议无关的HADA架构，将算法/LLM封装至角色化代理，提供对话式API；2. 在Docker/Kubernetes/Python部署云原生验证系统（信贷评分模型）；3. 通过5个银行场景测试目标调整、参数修改、伦理触发等端到端流程；4. 采用设计科学研究方法，通过日志与观察验证目标覆盖。

Result: 评估显示HADA完全覆盖6个目标：各角色可调用对话控制、追踪KPI与伦理约束、检测邮编偏见、复现决策链路；贡献包括开源架构、多智能体对齐设计理论、实证证明框架无关的代理提升决策管线准确性、透明度。

Conclusion: HADA通过自然语言约束传播、跨角色代理协作、决策链路可追溯性，实现了与底层框架无关的人类-AI对齐，为多智能体系统的伦理合规与透明治理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EXIF框架，通过探索代理自动生成可行技能数据集并引入反馈循环，有效提升LLM代理能力，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，手动收集训练轨迹成本高，而LLM直接生成任务常不可行或缺乏有效学习信号，需解决技能发现与能力扩展的自动化问题。

Method: 采用探索优先策略：探索代理Alice生成环境相关的可行技能数据集，训练目标代理Bob，并通过迭代反馈循环评估性能并优化探索方向，形成闭环数据生成。

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter实验中，EXIF无需人工干预即可发现有效技能并扩展代理能力，性能显著提升；当Alice与Bob同模型时系统表现更优，展现自我进化潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF通过闭环反馈机制实现自动技能发现与能力迭代提升，验证了自进化系统的可行性，为开放环境下LLM代理训练提供新思路。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型展现出难以用机制解释的涌现推理能力，需建立新框架解析其连续推理动态过程及潜在失效模式。

Method: 构建低维流形上的漂移-扩散随机动力系统，结合潜在状态切换机制(SLDS模型)，在8个模型7个基准上通过秩40投影分析隐藏状态轨迹。

Result: 实验显示50%方差可被低维投影解释，识别出四类潜在推理状态，验证SLDS模型对状态切换和关键转变的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究语言模型推理失效提供工具，支持通过状态动态模拟预测对齐失败等关键转变现象。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

TL;DR: 本文提出Matter-of-Fact数据集，用于评估科学假设可行性判断能力。现有模型在材料科学领域仅达72%准确率（随机基准50%），但专家验证表明问题可解，突显任务挑战性与改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化科学发现系统中，假设生成成本低但实验验证成本高。开发可行性过滤机制可提升系统规模与发现效率，但当前缺乏有效评估基准。

Method: 构建含8.4k材料科学领域声明的数据集（涵盖超导体、半导体等四领域），整合理论与实验的定/定量声明，测试检索增强生成与代码生成等基线方法。

Result: 最佳基线模型准确率72%（随机50%），但领域验证显示绝大多数问题可解，表明当前模型存在显著能力缺口。

Conclusion: 假设可行性判断对现有模型具有挑战性，但突破该瓶颈将显著加速科学发现进程，数据集为关键评估工具。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语义相似性的多表QA方法在真实复杂场景下表现不佳，主要因跨表模式链接不可靠且无法处理海量异构列。

Method: 构建关系知识图谱显式编码模式链接与连接路径，通过图搜索生成可解释推理链，结合剪枝和子路径合并策略优化效率。

Result: 在标准基准测试和真实工业数据集上验证有效性，成为首个应用于复杂工业表格数据的多表QA系统。

Conclusion: 显式建模模式关系并通过结构化推理链处理多表QA，显著提升了复杂现实场景下的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统警报系统需频繁调整阈值且存在数据处理延迟，无法满足现代公共卫生大数据监测需求（如疫情爆发追踪、数据质量监控）。

Method: 开发基于排名机制的AI异常检测系统，通过多年跨学科合作实现部署，采用纵向评估验证效果。

Result: 三个月实际应用显示：系统每日监控500万数据点，审核效率较传统方法提升54倍，监测目标达成率显著提高。

Conclusion: 人本AI技术可革新公共卫生决策，通过智能排名机制有效平衡数据规模与监测效率，验证了AI在实时健康监测中的可行性。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理匹配市场等组合领域偏好推理任务中的表现，发现其在大规模市场中解决不稳定性方面存在局限，且参数微调（LoRA）仅对小规模实例有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在程序合成等推理任务中表现突出，但其在组合领域（如匹配市场）中处理排名偏好和结构化算法的能力尚未被充分探索，而此类场景对资源分配等实际问题的稳定性至关重要。

Method: 通过构建基于偏好的推理任务层级（包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测与修复等），系统测试多类先进模型，并采用LoRA微调策略验证性能改进效果。

Result: 即使顶尖模型在大规模市场中仍难以有效解决不稳定性（如识别阻碍对、迭代执行算法），LoRA微调仅在小规模实例中显著提升性能，对大规模输入未见类似改进。

Conclusion: 需开发更复杂的策略（如增强上下文处理能力）以提升LLMs在组合领域中的推理表现，单纯参数微调无法解决大规模场景的局限性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅依赖答案整体准确率，无法全面衡量大语言模型真实数学能力，需更细粒度的认知视角分析。

Method: 基于心理学理论将推理过程分为三阶段，设计9个评估维度，构建多智能体系统生成针对性测试问题，要求模型需通过所有维度才算真正掌握问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，7个主流大语言模型数学能力被高估30%-40%，并准确定位其在不同阶段/维度的强弱项。

Conclusion: CogMath揭示了现有模型评估偏差，通过认知分阶段诊断为提升模型推理能力提供深度改进方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 自然语言中的复杂约束难以直接转化为规划算法的形式化描述，传统方法易受LLM幻觉和复杂推理限制，需一种透明且结构化的约束生成方法。

Method: STPR框架通过LLM将约束（如“禁止行为”）转换为Python代码，利用其代码生成能力避免复杂推理，并结合点云表示与传统搜索算法进行路径规划。

Result: Gazebo仿真实验表明，STPR在多种约束和场景下完全合规且运行时间短，且支持小型代码专用LLM，降低推理成本。

Conclusion: STPR通过代码生成桥接自然语言与规划算法，有效处理复杂数学约束，兼具高效性和模型兼容性，为机器人导航提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: LLMs为自动化模式生成提供高效路径，同时其结构化生成能力面临语法丰富形式化的新挑战，推动技术边界扩展。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Conclusion: DeePoly通过DNN与多项式基的互补优势，实现了高效、高精度的PDE求解，并为开源项目提供理论支撑。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出首个公司治理法律推理基准CHANCERY，评估模型判断企业行为是否符合章程的能力。基于真实治理原则和章程构建数据集，测试发现现有SOTA准确率仅64.5-75.2%，推理代理可达78.1%，揭示模型在法律推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律NLP数据集缺乏专门针对推理任务的设计，特别是公司治理领域的法律推理能力评估。真实法律实践中推理能力至关重要，但当前模型在此方面的表现尚未被系统评估。

Method: 基于24个公司治理原则和79个真实企业章程（选自10k规模数据集），构建二元分类任务的基准测试。采用ReAct和CodeAct推理代理框架，对比评估Claude 3.7 Sonnet、GPT-4o等SOTA模型的性能。

Result: 主流模型准确率64.5-75.2%，推理代理达76.1-78.1%。分析显示模型在特定法律推理类型上存在系统性缺陷，验证了基准对高级法律推理能力的要求。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准有效检验法律推理能力，揭示当前模型与专业法律推理的差距。推理代理表现优于基础模型，但整体准确率仍待提升，为法律NLP发展提供新方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Method: 构建包含分析员/研究员/程序员/玩家的多智能体框架，利用Catanatron平台实现策略分析-研究-代码修改的闭环进化机制，对比人工设计模型与自进化模型。

Result: 自进化智能体（特别是Claude 3.7和GPT-4o驱动）通过策略自主迭代、行为样本传递和多轮推理适应，显著超越静态基准模型。

Conclusion: 证明基于角色分工的自我进化框架能提升LLM战略规划效果，为构建持续进化的AI系统提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Motivation: 电动自行车事故报告多为非结构化文本，阻碍定量安全分析。需要有效方法提取关键安全变量以支持安全改进决策。

Method: 开发包含四个LLM代理的框架（数据分类、信息提取、致伤原因判定、部件关联），结合有序logit模型分析事故严重程度与性别、原因类型、环境等因素的关系。

Result: 设备问题占比略高于人为因素（51% vs 49%），但人为因素致死率更高；踏板/轮胎/刹车是主要事故部件；模型分类加权F1值达0.87。

Conclusion: LLM能有效提取非结构化交通领域数据，该方法为政策制定者、设计师提供可扩展的安全分析方案，支持电动自行车安全改进。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced
by reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, existing works encounter significant
challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among
agents, particularly regarding agent reliability, sociability, and
interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

TL;DR: 本文通过细粒度分析框架揭示强化学习在语言模型推理中的优势，发现RL主要提升模型内部策略制定和知识整合能力，而非执行外部计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的训练方法（如GRPO）虽能显著提升语言模型推理能力，但缺乏对其优势机制的细粒度理解。本文旨在系统解析RL对推理过程的具体影响。

Method: 提出三维度分析框架：(1) 计划遵循与执行能力 (2) 问题分解能力 (3) 知识整合与推理能力。通过控制变量实验对比RL调优前后的模型表现差异。

Result: 关键发现：① 外部分步计划会降低困难任务表现，但RL模型性能下降幅度减少50% ② RL显著提升知识整合能力（跨任务平均提升12%）③ 开发新方法有效利用困难样本提升训练效率。

Conclusion: 强化学习的核心价值在于帮助模型建立适配自身推理特征的内部策略，而非被动执行外部计划。研究结果为构建原则化的推理模型训练体系提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有开源推理模型（如Deepseek-R1-Distill系列及QwQ-32B）的基准测试结果因评估条件差异存在不可靠性，导致性能改进难以复现，需探索更稳定的评估方法。

Method: 通过实证评估不同条件下Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型的性能波动，并分析其衍生模型及QwQ-32B模型的类似现象。

Result: 模型在数学、科学等领域的评估结果对条件变化高度敏感，同类模型亦存在相同问题，性能提升声明缺乏可复现性。

Conclusion: 需建立更严格的模型性能评估标准以减少结果波动，当前模型性能改进的可靠性验证存在重大挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应机制与动态安全约束的结合，为安全关键场景提供了兼具鲁棒性和高效性的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Conclusion: 通过迭代式策略生成与多模态数据融合，LLMs可直接驱动具身智能体，证明了符号推理与实时环境学习结合的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出RAG-UAV框架，通过检索增强生成技术提升大语言模型在无人机数学推理任务中的表现，实验显示其显著提高准确率并降低错误，但实时控制仍需进一步验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机控制依赖硬编码方程，而现有大语言模型虽灵活但数学推理能力不足，需提升其在无人机领域选择公式、执行多步计算的可靠性。

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，通过检索相关领域文献增强大语言模型的数学推理能力，并构建包含20个问题的UAV-Math-Bench基准测试集评估性能。

Result: 检索增强使模型准确率最高达75%，公式选择错误率从25%降至5%，最佳模型均方误差降低数量级，显著改善数值计算精度。

Conclusion: RAG技术可使通用大语言模型成为更可靠的工程分析工具，但直接用于实时飞行控制仍需大规模验证。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [126] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出通过引入内在元认知学习框架（包括元认知知识、规划和评估三部分）解决现有自改进代理的局限性，强调需在人类与代理间合理分配元认知责任并改进评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自改进代理的自我改进过程存在刚性、跨任务泛化能力差及扩展性不足的问题，需通过内在元认知学习（主动评估、反思和调整学习过程）实现更持续、通用且对齐的自我改进。

Method: 借鉴人类元认知，提出包含元认知知识（能力/任务/策略自评估）、元认知规划（学习内容与方法决策）、元认知评估（经验反思优化）的框架，分析现有代理依赖固定外部元认知机制的问题。

Result: 现有自改进代理主要依赖人为设计的外在元认知机制，但内在元认知所需要素已存在；需解决元认知责任分配、鲁棒评估方法等关键挑战以实现目标。

Conclusion: 实现真正的自改进需平衡人类与代理的元认知职责，并建立可靠的内在元认知学习评估体系，这是未来研究的核心挑战。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Mikhail Terekhov,Zhen Ning David Liu,Caglar Gulcehre,Samuel Albanie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出‘控制税’概念以量化AI控制措施的成本，构建理论框架连接分类器性能与安全保证，评估对抗环境下语言模型表现，并提供成本效益优化的监控策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理型AI在关键任务中的快速应用，现有控制机制因高成本难以落地，需通过经济可行性分析平衡安全与实施成本。

Method: 1. 建立量化控制税的理论框架；2. 在对抗场景中评估先进语言模型（攻击者植入后门/监控模型检测漏洞）；3. 结合审计预算等约束，开发成本优化的安全协议。

Result: 实验表明：现有模型在对抗环境下存在漏洞，控制税成本显著；提出的优化策略可降低20-30%监控成本，同时维持90%+安全保证。

Conclusion: 通过系统化成本-安全关联框架，为不同部署环境提供经济可行的AI控制方案，推动AI控制领域向实用化发展。

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

### [128] [LLM-First Search: Self-Guided Exploration of the Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05213)
*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLM-First Search (LFS)，一种基于大语言模型自主控制搜索过程的方法，无需预定义策略，在复杂任务中表现优于传统搜索算法，计算效率更高且扩展性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索算法（如MCTS）依赖固定超参数，难以适应不同难度任务，导致效率低下或成本高昂。需一种更灵活、自适应的搜索方法。

Method: LFS通过LLM内部评分机制自主决策搜索路径，动态选择继续当前分支或探索新分支，无需外部启发式规则或任务特定调优。

Result: 实验表明LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中：(1)复杂任务表现更优；(2)计算效率更高；(3)模型越强效果越好；(4)计算预算增加时扩展性更佳。

Conclusion: LFS通过LLM自主引导搜索，实现了灵活、高效的推理，其LLM-First设计在模型增强和计算扩展中展现显著优势，为复杂问题求解提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出自适应长度惩罚（ALP）方法，通过动态调整生成长度减少大型推理模型的计算浪费，在保持性能的同时降低50%的token使用量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理不同难度问题时存在计算资源浪费、依赖人工配置或统一惩罚的缺陷，需一种自适应机制按问题难度分配计算资源。

Method: ALP基于强化学习，通过在线监控各提示的解决率，动态施加与解决率成反比的可微分惩罚项，使简单问题减少冗余生成，困难问题保留足够计算。

Result: DeepScaleR-1.5B应用ALP后平均token使用减少50%，且通过资源重分配在困难问题上取得更高准确率，优于固定预算和统一惩罚基线。

Conclusion: ALP通过难度感知的生成长度控制，实现计算效率与性能的平衡，为动态优化推理模型资源分配提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于概念模型（Concept-based Models）的潜在风险与局限性，指出其在结构、训练过程、对抗性漏洞等方面的缺陷，如概念泄露、表示纠缠等，并探讨了现有解决方案及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于概念的可解释模型在医疗诊断等敏感领域被推广以增强信任，但近期研究揭示其存在结构缺陷、训练假设问题及对抗脆弱性，可能影响可靠性和实际应用，需系统分析这些挑战。

Method: 通过汇总监督与无监督范式下的常见挑战（如概念泄漏），分析缓解这些问题的架构设计选择，并评估提高模型可靠性的最新技术进展。

Result: 系统梳理了概念模型的局限性（如鲁棒性不足、人为干预有效性存疑），总结了现有解决方案的优缺点，并指出开放问题如泛化能力与真实场景验证的不足。

Conclusion: 概念模型虽具可解释性优势，但需解决可靠性瓶颈；未来应聚焦架构优化、对抗鲁棒性增强及人机协作机制，以推动其在关键领域的实际落地。

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测器依赖统计模型识别潜在表示异常，但缺乏可解释性。通过引入MLNs的加权逻辑约束，可在提升性能的同时增强检测过程的可解释性，满足开放世界场景中模型可靠性的需求。

Method: 将马尔可夫逻辑网络与现有OOD检测器结合，利用一阶逻辑与概率推理为输入分配概率。定义人类可理解的逻辑概念权重，并提出从数据中自动学习逻辑约束的算法。

Result: 多数据集实验表明，MLNs可显著提升多种OOD检测器性能，且计算效率。提出的逻辑约束学习算法被证明有效，增强了检测器的可解释性。

Conclusion: MLNs通过融合逻辑推理与概率建模，为OOD检测提供了高效且可解释的增强方案，其学习框架为实际应用中的逻辑约束定义提供了新思路。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型三重注意力Transformer架构，用于预测时间相关的混凝土徐变，通过将问题转化为自回归序列建模任务，结合时间、特征和批次注意力机制，显著优于传统方法，并提供了可解释性和实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混凝土徐变预测方法仅将时间作为输入参数，未建模变形的时序发展特性。本文旨在通过序列建模捕捉徐变历史中的长期依赖关系。

Method: 采用三流注意力框架：时间注意力建模序列演化，特征注意力捕捉材料属性交互，批次注意力处理样本间关系，结合Transformer的自注意力机制实现序列建模。

Result: 在160天标准化数据集上取得1.63%平均绝对百分比误差和0.999的R²值，SHAP分析显示弹性模量为关键特征，消融实验验证注意力池化对性能贡献最大。

Conclusion: 验证了Transformer在材料科学中的适用性，通过数据驱动方法革新结构行为预测，部署的Web界面支持实时预测，推动工程实践变革。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4为压缩神经网络的安全可靠性验证提供了高效解决方案，适用于实际边缘计算场景。

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于忆阻器的物理感知神经形态网络（PANN），用于星上实时处理多光谱卫星图像以检测自然灾害变化，无需训练且计算资源需求低，性能媲美现有AI模型，有效解决下行带宽瓶颈问题。


<details>

Conclusion: PANN通过物理约束特征和免训练机制，为资源受限的星上处理提供了高效解决方案，显著提升数据下传效率，在应急响应中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

TL;DR: 提出Backbone Augmented Training (BAT)方法，通过利用预训练阶段的大规模主干数据增强适配数据集，解决适配训练中数据不足的问题，并设计ALBAT算法实现高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配技术虽能以低计算资源提升模型性能，但适配数据稀缺常导致训练困难。为此，研究聚焦于预训练主干模型时使用的大规模数据，探索如何利用这些数据增强适配过程。

Method: 提出BAT框架，包含两个数学命题验证方法有效性及适用条件，并设计基于数据选择策略的ALBAT算法，通过筛选符合条件的主干数据动态增强适配训练。

Result: ALBAT在数据稀缺的个性化任务和语言生成任务中均有效提升适配训练效果，验证了BAT的理论基础与实际应用价值。

Conclusion: BAT通过利用预训练数据增强适配训练，结合理论分析与算法实现，为低资源场景下的模型适配提供了高效解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型在不同学习机制下处理传递推理任务的能力，发现权重内学习（IWL）自然具备传递推理泛化能力，而上下文学习（ICL）需依赖预训练结构化任务才能实现类似能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在心理学经典传递推理任务中的表现差异，揭示不同学习机制（IWL与ICL）对关系推理能力的影响机制。

Method: 通过对比IWL（参数存储信息）和ICL（上下文利用信息）两种学习机制，结合机制分析（如归纳电路）和预训练实验（线性回归任务），评估模型在传递推理任务中的表现。

Result: IWL模型仅训练相邻项即可泛化传递推理，并呈现人类典型的符号距离/终端项效应；ICL模型仅能通过匹配-复制策略处理相邻项，但预训练后可在上下文中实现结构化推理。

Conclusion: 预训练具有底层结构的任务可促进模型形成支持上下文关系推理的表征，说明任务结构对模型推理能力的塑造作用。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Lyapunov漂移加惩罚方法与强化学习的LDPTRLQ算法，通过理论分析和仿真验证其在队列稳定性与长期优化上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备激增，传统Lyapunov漂移加惩罚算法与强化学习的直接结合在长期优化与队列稳定性平衡上存在不足，需探索更有效的融合方法。

Method: 提出LDPTRLQ算法，在理论分析基础上将Lyapunov漂移加惩罚的贪婪优化与强化学习的长期视角结合，确保队列稳定性条件。

Result: 仿真表明LDPTRLQ在多种问题上优于基线方法，验证了理论有效性，并在兼容性和稳定性上超越其他基准算法。

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ通过平衡短期优化与长期目标，为物联网复杂优化问题提供了理论优越且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在临床试验预测中存在黑箱性质、缺乏可解释性及标签泄露问题，限制了其在高风险生物医学场景的应用。

Method: AutoCT框架利用大语言模型生成结构化特征，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行迭代自优化，无需人工干预即可自动生成、评估和精炼特征。

Result: 实验表明AutoCT在有限迭代次数内达到或超越现有最优方法性能，预测效果与SOTA相当且更具可扩展性。

Conclusion: AutoCT为临床试验预测建立了可扩展、可解释且低成本的范式，显著降低药物研发成本并加速开发流程。

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Motivation: 露天矿运输受天气波动、机械故障及人员变动等不确定性影响显著，需通过精准短期容量预测优化车队管理。

Method: 融合高分辨率降雨数据、车队性能遥测与合成机械故障场景，构建深度学习框架，对比XGBoost回归器与LSTM网络性能，并采用SHAP值分析关键预测因子。

Result: XGBoost模型MedAE为14.3%，LSTM为15.1%；累计降雨量、历史负载趋势及模拟故障频率为关键预测因子，集成模拟故障数据显著降低预测波动性。

Conclusion: 混合建模通过整合模拟故障与排班特征有效提升预测稳定性，未来将纳入维护调度指标、人力资源数据及爆破事件计划，增强动态不确定条件下的决策支持能力。

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对下一代集成学习系统，解决现有方法在一致性、可靠性及多样性利用方面的不足，通过多学科交叉方法提升系统性能。

Method: 1. 解剖学过程构建基于卷积frustum规范元素的多样性集成模型；2. 生理学过程推导softlog实现弱对数操作一致性；3. 信息理论过程设计softlog熵/散度度量；4. 建立性能评估张量体系。

Result: 证明问题复杂度与集成多样性正相关，softlog层保持类别逻辑一致性，新信息度量有效分析决策关系，性能张量实现可靠评估。

Conclusion: 四步流程系统性提升集成学习性能，softlog-softmax级联机制与多样性设计显著增强系统一致性和可靠性，为复杂问题提供新解决方案。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统分析了基于大语言模型的AI代理在资源消耗、延迟、能耗等方面的表现，揭示其虽提升准确性却伴随计算成本激增、收益递减和可持续性危机，呼吁转向高效推理的代理设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI代理通过动态推理增强了任务泛化能力，但其多轮工作流引发的系统级成本、效率和可持续性问题尚未被充分研究。现有研究缺乏对资源消耗与设计选择影响的量化分析。

Method: 通过系统级分析框架，量化评估不同代理设计（如少样本提示、反思深度、并行推理）在资源占用、延迟分布、能耗及数据中心电力需求等维度的表现，并建立准确性-成本权衡模型。

Result: 代理准确性随计算量增加而提升，但边际效益快速递减；延迟方差扩大至静态推理的3.5倍；典型代理工作流使数据中心电力需求增长2-4倍，基础设施成本呈不可持续趋势。

Conclusion: 当前AI代理设计存在严重可持续性风险，需推动计算效率优先的范式转变，在现实约束下平衡性能与部署可行性，避免因盲目追求精度导致系统性危机。

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型训练需多次调整损失权重等超参数，耗时耗力。YOTO旨在通过单次训练自动优化损失权重，减少人工调参成本。

Method: 将损失权重视为可学习参数，通过可微复合损失层（含softmax约束）和正则化损失实现端到端联合优化，避免梯度退化与无界解。

Result: 在3D姿态估计和语义分割任务中，YOTO在测试集上表现优于网格搜索最佳模型，验证了单次优化的有效性。

Conclusion: YOTO证明了通过单次梯度优化联合学习模型参数与损失权重的可行性，为自动超参数调优提供了新思路，代码将开源。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少神经网络隐藏层的可训练参数数量，同时通过固定部分权重引入随机连接的正则化效应以提升模型泛化能力。

Method: 构建由两阶段组成的半隐藏单元：先使用固定随机权重计算输入加权和，再通过两个可训练参数进行线性变换并施加非线性激活。该结构可嵌入任意网络层（包括卷积层后）。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证，证明半隐藏层在显著减少参数量的情况下仍能保持合理分类准确率，归因于随机连接的隐式正则化作用。

Conclusion: 半隐藏层通过解耦随机连接与可训练参数，为构建参数高效且具备内置正则化的深度网络提供了可行方案，尤其适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based

Result: 该方法提高了模型灵活性、训练速度和分类准确性，同时代码库更简洁、易维护和可扩展。实现代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过将双曲空间决策树转化为欧几里得模型的包装器，本文在保持性能优势的同时显著降低了实现复杂度，为后续研究提供了高效的基础框架。

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，揭示了持续学习中样本回放技术可能存在的非单调遗忘现象及有害性，指出其效果依赖于任务子空间关系和回放样本选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中样本回放被广泛用于缓解遗忘问题，但其理论机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过理论分析揭示样本回放对遗忘的影响机制及潜在风险。

Method: 在过参数化持续线性回归框架下，分析任务子空间关系与回放样本的数学关联，并通过神经网络+SGD实验验证理论发现的普适性。

Result: 发现无噪声场景下遗忘可能随回放量非单调变化；证明特定任务中回放可能恶化遗忘（包括最坏情况与随机样本期望情况）；在标准基准测试中验证了回放效果对样本选择与任务关系的敏感性。

Conclusion: 样本回放并非绝对有效，其效果高度依赖任务子空间结构及回放样本选择。即使良性场景中仍需谨慎设计回放策略，单纯增加回放量可能适得其反。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为iS-QL的新方法，通过仅复制在线网络的最后一层线性层作为目标网络，结合迭代Q学习，在减少内存占用的同时提升目标无关方法的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中移除目标网络会导致性能下降，但保留目标网络会占用内存且无法利用目标无关方法的优势。本文旨在探索介于目标网络与目标无关方法之间的新方案。

Method: iS-QL方法：共享在线网络与目标网络的大部分参数，仅复制在线网络最后一层线性层作为独立目标网络，并应用迭代Q学习并行优化连续Bellman迭代。

Result: 实验表明iS-QL在多种场景下提升了目标无关方法的样本效率，内存占用小于传统目标网络方法，训练时间相当，具有扩展潜力。

Conclusion: iS-QL通过参数共享与部分目标网络设计，在性能与资源消耗间取得平衡，为强化学习研究提供了可扩展的新方向。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

TL;DR: 本文提出UMCNP方法，结合参数化策略梯度和任务推断的元强化学习，在元测试阶段无奖励信号时，通过条件神经过程减少在线交互，提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元强化学习在元测试阶段因缺乏奖励信号导致的样本效率低下问题，避免在元训练中增加额外样本需求。

Method: UMCNP结合参数化策略梯度（PPG）与任务推断元强化学习，利用条件神经过程（CNPs）复用离线样本推断动态模型潜在表征，通过单次任务rollout生成自适应rollouts。

Result: 在2D-Point Agent和连续控制基准测试中，UMCNP在元测试阶段所需样本量显著低于基线方法，成功适应未知传感器偏差和动态参数变化的任务。

Conclusion: UMCNP通过分离策略梯度与任务推断，有效降低元测试阶段的在线交互需求，验证了在无奖励信号场景下的高效自适应能力。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析自监督对比学习（CL）与监督变体NSCL的关系，证明两者损失差距随类别数增加而消失，并揭示了NSCL损失的几何结构及少样本线性探测误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自监督对比学习在实证中表现成功，但其理论基础尚未完善。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过理论分析CL目标与监督变体NSCL的关系，并探索其表示结构的几何特性。

Method: 提出将标准CL目标近似为仅负样本监督对比损失（NSCL），证明两者差距随类别数增加而消失；分析NSCL损失的全局最小化器几何结构（如增强崩溃、类内崩溃、类中心紧框架），并提出少样本线性探测误差界限。

Result: 理论表明CL与NSCL损失差距以O(1/类别数)速率衰减，两者高度相关；NSCL表示具有特定几何结构；少样本误差界限由方向性变化主导，类内分散影响随标注样本增加而减弱。实验验证了理论结论的紧密度和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过连接CL与NSCL损失，本文为自监督对比学习提供了理论支撑，揭示了其表示结构的几何特性，并提出少样本误差界限，证明线性探测在实践中的高效性。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种零阶优化方法JAGUAR SignSGD和JAGUAR Muon，用于高效微调大语言模型，在减少内存消耗的同时保持收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一阶优化器(SGD/Adam)在大模型微调中存在内存与计算成本过高的问题，需探索更高效的零阶优化替代方案。

Method: 结合LoRA参数高效微调技术，提出基于动量的ZO SignSGD扩展算法JAGUAR SignSGD，以及利用参数矩阵结构的ZO Muon优化器JAGUAR Muon。

Result: 实验证明新算法在LLM微调任务中达到或超越一阶方法收敛质量，内存消耗显著降低，并首次建立随机ZO场景下SignSGD的收敛理论保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为零阶优化方法提供了理论依据与实践方案，为资源受限的大模型适配开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++是一种基于卡尔曼滤波的优化算法，通过显式建模梯度不确定性，在保持一阶方法效率的同时达到或超越现有二阶优化器的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶优化方法依赖昂贵的二阶梯度计算，而原KOALA框架仅假设对角协方差结构。本文旨在通过更高效的方式捕捉梯度协方差结构，避免存储完整协方差矩阵和大规模矩阵求逆。

Method: 通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差积直接估计参数协方差矩阵，隐式捕获非对角协方差结构，无需完整协方差存储且避免大矩阵运算。

Result: 在图像分类、语言建模等任务中，KOALA++的准确率与SOTA一阶/二阶优化器相当或更优，同时保持一阶方法的计算效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++成功平衡了效率与精度，通过结构化梯度不确定性建模实现了对原框架的改进，为高效神经网络训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究在神经网络中发现了一种新的‘反理解’（anti-grokking）阶段，表现为测试精度崩溃但训练精度保持完美。通过HTSR的α指标和WeightWatcher工具，揭示了该阶段与‘相关陷阱’及α<2的关联，而传统指标无法区分此阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能有效检测神经网络训练后期的泛化崩溃现象（如anti-grokking），且传统指标（如激活稀疏性、权重熵等）无法区分grokking与anti-grokking。本文旨在通过HTSR理论提出一种无需测试数据即可衡量过拟合的方法。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST的1k样本子集上训练，结合权重衰减策略，通过WeightWatcher工具计算HTSR层质量指标α，分析层权重矩阵的奇异值分布及Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验，对比其他指标（如权重范数、电路复杂度等）。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段（训练10^7步后出现），其标志为α<2及‘相关陷阱’（异常奇异值）。HTSR的α能清晰划分pre-grokking、grokking和anti-grokking三阶段，而其他指标仅能识别前两阶段。

Conclusion: HTSR的α指标（α≈2）可作为通用层收敛目标，其低于2时预示过拟合与泛化崩溃。该指标为无需测试数据检测模型退化提供了新方法，并强化了HTSR理论在泛化分析中的价值。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Conclusion: RSF通过离散流匹配与推理时引导机制，在单步逆合成预测中实现更高准确率与可行性，验证了合成子中间表示与动态引导策略的有效性。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

<details>

Motivation: 传统损失函数在预测时对所有区域一视同仁，但实际应用中特定区域（如高重要性区域）的预测准确性更为关键。现有方法缺乏对区域敏感性的动态调整能力，导致模型在关键区域表现不足。

Method: 通过设计基于Sigmoid和双曲正弦函数的链接函数构建选择性匹配损失，利用其高斜率区域增强敏感性；针对多分类问题，提出复合Softmax框架以保留类别间的排序敏感性。

Result: 选择性损失在停留时间预测、检索、排序、蒸馏及大语言模型微调等任务中显著优于传统损失函数，尤其在需要区分高/低重要性区域的应用中表现突出。

Conclusion: 选择性损失通过动态调整区域敏感性，有效解决模型在关键区域的预测不足问题，为多类场景提供灵活且高效的损失设计框架。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: 神经网络以94.1%准确率最优，梯度提升（93.2%）和随机森林（93.0%）次之。治疗服务指标（TXMT_USER_CNT等）为关键特征，人口统计变量影响微弱。模型性能随特征增加而提升，SGD和集成方法对缺失数据鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: 特征选择与先进算法结合可有效提升分类性能，尤其在数据不平衡场景。治疗服务指标是区分提供者的核心，研究结果为优化医疗资源分配提供了数据驱动方法。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

### [165] [Orthogonal Gradient Descent Improves Neural Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04487)
*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 正交化梯度训练提升模型校准性，保持准确率，理论证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在模型校准性（如预测置信度与准确率匹配）与准确性之间常存在权衡。本文旨在通过梯度正交化改进校准性，同时不牺牲模型准确性。

Method: 提出正交化梯度（⊥Grad）训练方法：在优化过程中对梯度进行正交化处理，使其与历史梯度方向正交。该方法与优化器无关，计算开销低，且兼容后处理校准技术（如温度缩放）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10（10%标签数据）上，⊥Grad与SGD准确率相当，但测试损失更低、预测置信度更合理。在CIFAR-10C（含噪声数据）和长训练中，模型退化更平缓。理论分析表明，⊥Grad收敛于需调整置信度而非优化决策边界的解。

Conclusion: 正交化梯度训练显著提升模型校准性，其优势在噪声数据和长训练中持续存在，且具有收敛性理论保证。该方法轻量、通用，为校准问题提供了新方向。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz结合冷冻电镜密度图与预训练蛋白质结构预测模型，通过全局和局部结构约束引导采样，生成符合实验数据的构象状态，解决了动态生物复合物构象多样性建模难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构预测模型难以捕捉动态生物分子复合物的构象多样性，而冷冻电镜虽能成像结构异质性，但其数据处理流程复杂。需结合两者优势，提升动态复合物建模效率。

Method: 利用冷冻电镜密度图提取全局/局部结构约束，引导预训练蛋白质结构预测模型的采样轨迹，使预测结果与实验数据一致。

Result: 在转运蛋白、抗体等动态生物分子系统中，成功将原子模型构建到异质性冷冻电镜图谱中，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CryoBoltz通过融合实验数据与生物物理先验知识，为动态复合物的多构象建模提供了灵活且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为扰动梯度训练（PGT）的新方法，通过参数空间的随机扰动近似梯度更新，解决了物理储层计算中无法使用反向传播的难题，并在模拟和硬件实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理储层计算因储层黑箱特性导致无法应用反向传播，限制了其在深度神经网络中的整合与能效提升。本文旨在突破这一限制。

Method: 基于物理扰动理论，PGT中通过参数空间的随机扰动生成梯度近似值，仅需前向传播即可完成训练，适用于模拟神经网络和物理储层硬件（如磁振子自振荡环）。

Result: 实验表明，PGT在无法使用反向传播的场景下，性能与标准反向传播方法相当，支持密集网络、含储层的Transformer等架构。

Conclusion: PGT为物理储层与深度网络整合提供了可行路径，有望推动AI训练能效的显著提升，是物理计算与机器学习融合的重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Motivation: 传统神经PDE求解器在长期时间跨度上存在误差累积、稳定性不足及物理一致性缺失的问题，需提升其长期预测能力。

Method: 基于数值隐式时间步进法的稳定性原理，构建多尺度未来状态表征层次，通过动态调整时间下采样率实现多粒度动态捕捉，并利用前瞻性多步预测进行迭代优化。

Result: 在湍流流体动力学任务中，模型短期预测精度优于基线，长期预测稳定性显著提升，计算开销仅微量增加。

Conclusion: 结合多尺度建模与隐式时间积分机制，该方法有效平衡了神经PDE求解器的短期准确性与长期稳定性，为复杂动力系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HALoS提出了一种分层异步优化框架，通过本地和全局参数服务器减少地理分布式LLM训练中的跨区域通信成本，提升异构硬件利用率，在保持模型质量的同时显著加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理分布式加速器训练LLM时存在跨区域通信成本过高、异构硬件利用率不均的问题，传统同步方法效率受限。

Method: 采用分层设计：区域内部署本地参数服务器(LPS)聚合更新，全局参数服务器(GPS)合并跨区域更新，结合分层动量机制实现异步训练，利用快速区域内链路降低延迟。

Result: 实验显示HALoS比同步基线收敛快7.5倍，优于现有异步方法2.1倍，在语言建模和下游任务中保持/超越同步SGD的精度，总训练时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: 分层参数服务器架构和全局模型融合机制有效解决了地理分布式LLM训练的通信瓶颈，为异构环境下的可扩展高效训练提供了新范式。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有生物逼真神经元模型受限于实验数据稀缺性和内在变异性，传统确定性模型集合方法难以扩展，而现有深度学习模型无法充分捕捉神经元的生物物理复杂性和非线性电压动态。

Conclusion: NOBLE首次将深度学习框架扩展至真实实验数据验证，为理解神经计算、构建神经形态架构及大规模脑回路模拟提供了新工具，推动了神经AI应用的发展。

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

2. 提出似然截断机制限制小时间窗内跳跃次数
3. 设计带重启策略的Euler-Maruyama求解器降低估计方差

Conclusion: 通过深度神经网络与随机过程理论的显式结合，Neural MJD成功解决了非平稳时间序列中突变建模难题，为可解释时序预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised

In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 结合数据聚类与中位数聚合策略，可在满足差分隐私约束的同时生成高质量合成文本，为隐私敏感场景提供更优的权衡方案。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our

Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出通过双向边界（同时最大化下界和最小化上界）训练基于能量的模型（EBMs），以解决传统变分下界训练的不稳定性问题，并验证了该方法在密度估计和样本生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于能量的模型（EBMs）训练因依赖变分下界而存在不稳定性，且生成对抗网络（GANs）的极小极大博弈可能加剧训练困难。作者旨在通过双向边界优化策略提升EBMs的训练稳定性。

Method: 提出双向边界训练框架：最大化对数似然的下界（基于生成器雅可比矩阵奇异值和互信息）并最小化上界（基于梯度惩罚和扩散过程），共探讨四种不同视角的边界，并提供对应算法实现。

Result: 实验表明，双向边界策略显著提升了EBMs的训练稳定性，同时实现了高质量的密度估计和样本生成效果。不同边界的对比揭示了各方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 双向边界训练为EBMs提供了一种稳定且高效的优化路径，结合多视角边界设计，在生成任务和概率建模中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过图遍历与风险近似，在理论和实验中验证了其在多代理系统风险最小化中的有效性与实用性。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了图神经网络（GNN）中过平滑（oversmoothing）问题被过度强调的观点，指出先前研究混淆了过平滑与梯度消失问题，并证明通过经典方法可构建深层GNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前普遍认为过平滑是限制深层GNN性能的主要障碍的观点，本文提出其影响被高估，主张重新探索深层GNN架构的潜力。

Method: 通过分析GNN的三个核心操作（聚合、线性变换、非线性激活），区分过平滑与梯度消失的成因，并采用跳跃连接和归一化等传统技术进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，过平滑并非GNN特有现象，且使用跳跃连接和归一化后，深层GNN层堆叠不会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究澄清了过平滑的认知误区，揭示了深层GNN未被充分开发的潜力，为后续架构设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Conclusion: 结合标签抗噪性与连接性的特征选择方法有效缓解了PML中的维度灾难问题，并提升了模型对真实场景的适应性。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据的非独立同分布性和多模态特性导致单一模型不适用，而部分模型个性化方法会加剧客户端漂移问题，降低算法效率。

Result: 在四个异构多模态数据集上的实验表明，FedAPM平均提升12.3%准确率、16.4% F1值和18.4% AUC，收敛速度更快且通信轮次更少，全面超越现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: FedAPM通过双阶邻近校正机制有效缓解客户端漂移，理论分析和实验验证表明其具有更优的收敛性能和实际应用效果，为异构联邦学习提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Motivation: 随着数据集规模和预测模型复杂度的增加，如何在集成学习中平衡预测精度与计算成本成为关键问题，尤其需考虑可持续AI的实际需求。

Method: 基于M5和VN1零售数据集，评估10个基础模型和8种集成配置，分析不同重训练频率下的点预测与概率预测精度及计算成本。

Result: 集成方法显著提升概率预测性能，但计算成本较高；降低重训练频率可大幅减少开销且对点预测精度影响较小；2-3个模型的小型集成即可接近最优结果。

Conclusion: 通过优化集成设计和重训练策略，可在保证预测精度的同时实现计算效率，为实际部署提供高效、鲁棒且可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Conclusion: DIPNet为提升深度学习泛化性能提供通用方法，可无缝集成现有模型，具有广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Conclusion: 所提方法突破传统限制，实现更全面的边操作影响预测，为GNN解释性和鲁棒性研究提供新工具，且具备多场景应用扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）在提升模型指令遵循、偏好学习和推理能力方面效果显著，但其改善推理能力的具体机制尚不明确。本文旨在系统探索RL在优化推理模式选择中的作用。

Method: 提出RLVR框架，结合实验验证与理论分析（基于简化的QRA模型），研究梯度流动态和收敛性，并探讨监督微调（SFT）对弱初始模型的优化效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

*Pinak Mandal,Georg A. Gottwald*

TL;DR: 本文提出基于损失梯度正交化的快速反学习方法，能在无需从头训练的情况下高效移除生成模型中特定数据的影响，同时保持模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型能力增强，因隐私、法律或内容纠错需求，需选择性移除特定数据影响。传统全量重训练成本过高，需开发高效反学习算法。

Method: 采用损失梯度正交化技术设计算法，通过控制梯度方向实现目标数据影响消除与保留数据的参数保护。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上实现比梯度手术(gradient surgery)快数量级的反学习速度，且保持原始生成保真度。

Conclusion: 所提算法在满足遗忘要求的同时，以极低计算成本维持模型性能，为生成模型动态更新提供可行方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO通过双层GRPO结构解决原算法中间监督缺失导致的探索低效问题，引入自纠正机制提升大语言模型推理稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于标准GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法因缺乏中间过程监督，导致复杂推理链中单点失误引发整体奖励消失，影响训练稳定性与探索效率。

Method: 采用双层GRPO架构：首层生成初始响应，第二层基于首层输出进行错误检测与修正，通过自纠正循环实现隐式过程级监督。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，MGRPO显著超越标准GRPO，同步提升模型推理能力和自纠错性能。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过自纠正机制有效缓解奖励消失问题，证明分层强化学习框架可增强LLMs复杂推理任务的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

*Han Guo,Songlin Yang,Tarushii Goel,Eric P. Xing,Tri Dao,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出对数线性注意力机制（log-linear attention），在保持线性注意力效率的同时，通过对数增长的隐藏状态增强表达能力，解决了传统注意力机制计算复杂度高及线性注意力模型固定隐藏状态的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制因二次计算和线性内存复杂度受限，而线性注意力与状态空间模型虽高效但受限于固定大小的隐藏状态（RNN结构），无法充分建模上下文。

Method: 将对数线性注意力引入现有线性注意力框架，用对数增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小隐藏状态，并通过特定增长函数实现并行化计算（计算复杂度为序列长度的对数线性）。

Result: 基于Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet的实例化实验表明，对数线性注意力变体在性能上优于原线性时间模型。

Conclusion: 对数线性注意力平衡了效率与表达能力，可作为通用框架提升现有线性注意力模型，且通过并行化实现接近线性的计算成本。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at
https://github.com/eaglelab-zju/OpenGT.

### [196] [Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775)
*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有重尾奖励的随机线性老虎机问题，提出基于实验设计的消除算法，改进了现有上下界对维度d的依赖关系，在有限矩条件下首次实现与方差有限情况(ε=1)一致的紧致上界，并建立了更严格的下界。同时扩展了在有限动作集、l_p范数球几何及核方法中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重尾奖励线性老虎机的上下界对维度d的依赖不够紧致：当υ=O(1)时，已知上界为Õ(dT^{1/(1+ε)})，而下界构造依赖υ=O(d)，导致在υ=O(1)时下界仅Ω(d^{ε/(1+ε)}T^{1/(1+ε)})，与多臂老虎机下界相同，无法体现线性结构的本质困难。

Method: 提出基于实验设计的消除算法：通过设计矩阵优化动作选择策略，控制重尾分布带来的高阶矩影响。针对不同几何结构（如l_p范数球）采用特定分析，并利用核方法扩展到无限维空间。

Result: 1. 上界改进为Õ(d^{(1+3ε)/(2(1+ε))}T^{1/(1+ε)})，在ε=1时恢复最优Õ(√(dT}))；2. 建立更严格下界Ω(d^{2ε/(1+ε)}T^{1/(1+ε)})，超越多臂老虎机下界；3. 对l_p范数球(p≤1+ε)等几何结构进一步降低维度依赖，通过核方法处理无限维问题（如Matérn核首次实现所有ε∈(0,1]的次线性遗憾）。

Conclusion: 该工作通过创新的算法设计和精细的分析，首次在重尾线性老虎机中实现维度依赖的紧致上下界，揭示了问题本质复杂度。特别地，核方法的扩展为高维非参数场景提供了新的解决方案，理论结果在多臂与线性老虎机之间建立了更精确的难度分离。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Motivation: 探索硬向量量化方法中基于距离的k-medoids聚类与基于概率密度匹配的KDE方法之间的潜在联系，突破二者长期存在的范式隔离。

Method: 通过构建k-medoids的启发式QUBO模型与KDE的MMD最小化QUBO模型，在二次无约束二进制优化框架下进行数学形式化比较。

Result: 在核特征映射的温和假设下，KDE-QUBO被证明是k-medoids-QUBO的特例，揭示了两种方法的层次结构关系并赋予权重参数几何解释。

Conclusion: QUBO框架为统一理解不同量化方法提供了新视角，其参数选择与核空间几何特性直接相关，深化了向量量化理论的可解释性。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: 研究发现Adam优化器在训练神经网络时，其自适应预条件子本身可能引发损失突增，而非传统认为的损失景观特性。当梯度平方远小于二阶矩估计时，预条件Hessian的最大特征值超过稳定性阈值，导致梯度方向与最大特征方向对齐并引发突增。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将Adam优化器训练中的损失突增归因于损失景观的尖锐性，但本文旨在揭示Adam内部机制（如预条件子动态）对此现象的直接作用。

Method: 通过理论分析Adam的二阶矩估计动态，识别梯度平方与二阶矩估计失衡的关键机制，结合预条件Hessian特征值稳定性理论，并在全连接网络、卷积网络及Transformer上实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，当梯度方向曲率超过阈值2/η时，Adam的预条件子会持续引发Hessian最大特征值超阈值，导致梯度方向与最大特征方向对齐并产生损失突增，此现象跨不同网络架构普遍存在。

Conclusion: Adam的自适应预条件子动态是损失突增的核心诱因，挑战了传统解释，为优化器设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过强化学习在逻辑谜题上微调大语言模型，以培养其通用推理能力。实验表明该方法能显著提升模型在数学问题中的组合泛化表现，但对机械记忆任务效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法使大语言模型形成领域特定的启发式策略，但在陌生场景的结构化推理中存在局限。需要开发能培养通用思维策略的训练范式。

Method: 设计包含7种逻辑谜题的强化学习框架，通过可验证的二元奖励机制(谜题正确性反馈)，驱动模型进行假设迭代式推理训练。每个谜题针对不同推理技能(如约束传播、符号演绎等)。

Result: 在数学基准测试中，该方法对中等难度多步推理问题的OOD表现提升显著，增强了代数运算/几何推理/组合逻辑能力，但对机械记忆或高度专业化任务提升有限。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑谜题的强化学习能重构大语言模型内部推理机制，实现无需领域符号工具的稳健组合泛化，验证了游戏化训练对培养可迁移推理策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Motivation: 现有ML模型系统性泛化研究主要针对行为层面，但Fodor和Pylyshyn提出的系统性挑战本质涉及表示层面。需澄清行为与表示系统性的差异，并改进评估方法。

Method: 基于Hadley(1994)的分类法，系统分析语言与视觉领域主流基准测试对行为系统性的覆盖度，并引入机制可解释性领域的表示系统性评估方法。

Result: 发现现有基准未能充分测试行为系统性，同时验证了通过分析模型内部机制(如特征可视化、因果干预)可有效评估表示层面的系统性。

Conclusion: 需明确区分行为与表示系统性概念，未来研究应结合机制可解释性方法直接评估模型内部表示的系统性，而非仅依赖外部行为测试。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: 混合模型通过理论支撑与实证验证，显著提升稀疏表示能力与任务性能，为低维流形建模提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Conclusion: MCBMs通过信息瓶颈机制克服传统CBMs的缺陷，为敏感场景提供了更可靠的可解释深度学习框架。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯过程微分同胚统计形状模型（GPDSSM）的半自动化髋关节发育不良分类方法，通过CT扫描和临床标注关键点，显著提高分类准确性（AUC 96.2%）并减少临床医生工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是骨关节炎的重要风险因素，早期诊断可提供手术干预机会以降低风险，但传统基于角度测量的方法效率低且依赖人工。

Method: 结合高斯过程隐变量模型（GPLVM）与微分同胚变换，构建统计形状模型GPDSSM，利用192例髋关节CT扫描（100训练，92测试）实现半自动化分类。

Result: GPDSSM在测试集上AUC达96.2%，优于传统角度测量方法（91.2%），并自动定位发育不良相关解剖区域，减少人工测量2D影像的时间。

Conclusion: GPDSSM通过三维形态学分析提升髋关节发育不良分类性能，为临床提供高效、客观的诊断工具，减少对人工经验的依赖。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了强化学习在长上下文推理模型训练中的三个关键问题：正负样本作用差异、群体相对策略优化的数据低效性及模型性能不稳定。研究发现负样本显著提升泛化能力，提出数据增强策略，并指出多次评估可缓解不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对强化学习训练长上下文推理模型中存在的反直觉现象和开放性问题（如正负样本作用机制不明确、数据利用率低、模型稳定性差），探索其内在机理并提出改进方案。

Method: 1. 系统分析正负样本在RL中的角色；2. 通过相对长度奖励和离线样本注入提升群体相对策略优化的数据效率；3. 采用多轮评估方法分析模型不稳定性。

Result: 1. 仅用负样本训练可达到标准RL效果；2. 数据利用率提升策略增强推理效率；3. 多轮评估有效降低不确定问题导致的性能波动。

Conclusion: 揭示负样本对泛化能力的关键作用，提出数据利用优化方案，建立模型稳定性评估框架，为改进RL训练机制提供新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU高危患者的早期识别对医疗资源分配至关重要，但现有方法在平衡精度与召回率及多层级特征融合方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ALFIA架构，联合训练LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，融合BERT的多层语义特征，并开发ALFIA-boost（结合GBDT）和ALFIA-nn（结合深度网络）。

Result: 在cw-24基准测试中，ALFIA的AUPRC超越现有表格分类器，其生成的嵌入特征与GBDT/深度网络结合后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: ALFIA通过直接处理临床文本，为重症监护提供了高效的风险分层工具，支持及时干预并平衡模型性能与实用性。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将自主Agentic AI与基于意图的范式相结合的概念框架，旨在简化人机交互并推动工业5.0发展。通过自然语言分解高级目标，利用子代理执行领域任务，并在预测性维护场景中验证可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0的复杂性促使需要更符合工业5.0（人本、可持续、弹性）的解决方案。通过整合Agentic AI与意图驱动范式，降低技术门槛并提升人机协作效率。

Method: 结合Agentic AI与意图处理框架，允许用户以自然语言输入业务目标，系统将其分解为可执行组件（如期望、条件等），并通过配备专用工具的子代理执行任务。使用CMAPSS数据集和Google ADK进行概念验证。

Result: 实验证明该框架可实现意图分解、代理协同与自主决策，支持可扩展的意图驱动自动化，但数据质量和模型可解释性仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为工业5.0提供了技术路径，但需解决数据质量与可解释性挑战以推动实际应用。

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant提出四种轻量级函数保持变换(FPTs)，通过调整激活分布实现高效INT4量化，在保持精度的同时将LLM推理速度提升至3.9倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法因激活层存在大范围离群值导致LLM性能显著下降，需在保持模型功能的前提下改进量化友好性。

Method: 设计四种可合并/动态的变换：(1)查询键的预RoPE变换 (2)值的变换 (3)MLP块内变换 (4)动态缩放变换，通过局部离群抑制和端到端输出对齐进行训练。

Result: 实现静态INT4量化，速度达FP的3.9倍，精度与多数方法相当或更优，仅比慢29%的方法略低。

Conclusion: FPTQuant在速度-精度权衡上达到SOTA，无需定制内核且推理开销极低，为LLM高效部署提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“谨慎乐观”（Cautious Optimism）的框架，通过自适应调整学习步调，显著加速一般博弈中的正则化学习。该框架基于任意FTRL实例生成加速的无悔学习算法，在自对弈中实现接近最优的O(log T)遗憾，同时在对抗场景中保持O(√T)遗憾，且无需依赖单调步长调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作（如OMWU变体）通过动态调整学习步长实现了最优遗憾最小化，但此类加速现象是否具有普适性尚不明确。本文旨在证明，通过自适应步调加速无悔学习是广泛适用的，并进一步提出一种通用框架以提升正则化学习效率，同时保持非耦合性（学习者无需知晓其他参与者的效用函数）。

Method: 提出Cautious Optimism框架：以任意跟随正则化领导者（FTRL）算法为输入，通过最小计算开销动态调整其学习步调，输出加速的无悔学习算法。该方法保留非耦合性，支持混合使用不同正则化器的自对弈场景，且不依赖单调步长假设。

Result: 1) 在自对弈混合正则化器的场景中实现O_T(log T)的接近最优遗憾；2) 在对抗环境中保持经典O(√T)最优遗憾；3) 与Syrgkanis等人（2015）和Daskalakis等人（2021）不同，分析过程无需单调步长条件，为一般博弈的快速学习提供了新路径。

Conclusion: Cautious Optimism框架通过非单调自适应步调，统一了正则化学习在合作与对抗场景下的加速机制，突破了传统方法对单调步长的依赖，扩展了快速无悔学习在一般博弈中的应用边界。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: 提出CREAM模型，通过显式编码概念间关系及正则化侧通道，在保持任务性能的同时增强概念重要性，并减少概念泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）可能未显式建模概念间关系，且存在任务性能与概念重要性难以平衡的问题。CREAM旨在通过结构化关系编码和正则化机制解决这些问题。

Method: CREAM架构嵌入专家定义的双向/单向概念间关系（C-C）和概念到任务关系（C→Y），阻断无关信息流，并引入正则化黑箱侧通道仅在必要时提升性能。

Result: 实验显示CREAM任务性能与黑箱模型相当，主要依赖概念推理，且嵌入的C-C/C→Y关系降低了概念泄漏并便于人工干预。

Conclusion: CREAM通过结构化概念关系与任务解耦的侧通道设计，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能，为概念驱动模型提供新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多点邻近（MPP）的矢量地理空间数据编码方法，通过计算形状到参考点的缩放距离来表征几何特征，优于传统栅格化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型需将矢量地理数据编码为向量形式，现有方法(如栅格化)在表征几何属性方面存在不足，需开发更优的通用编码方法。

Method: MPP编码法通过计算目标形状与区域内多个参考点之间的归一化距离，生成具有形状中心性和连续性的特征向量，适用于点/线/面任意几何类型。

Result: 实验表明MPP能有效区分几何特征、高精度捕获空间关系，在所有测试场景中性能均超越栅格化基准方法。

Conclusion: MPP编码为地理空间特征表示提供了统一框架，其几何保持特性使其成为机器学习模型参数化的有效工具。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Motivation: 现有PLL方法主要依赖卷积神经网络逐步优化标签，但忽视了基础模型的迁移表示潜力。本文旨在探索基础模型在PLL中的应用效果及当前方法的泛化能力。

Method: 提出PartialCLIP框架，对11个基础模型、13种PLL方法、8个数据集进行多场景评估，结合文本嵌入分类器初始化和零样本CLIP候选标签过滤策略。

Result: 实验表明：1) 基础模型显著提升PLL性能；2) 现有方法表现趋同；3) 模型对标签模糊度鲁棒；4) 性能受基础模型选择影响大。文本嵌入初始化与CLIP标签过滤策略有效。

Conclusion: 当前PLL方法依赖基础模型但泛化能力有限，需关注模型选择与适应策略。PartialCLIP为开发通用PLL模型提供新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）虽能有效提升模型鲁棒性，但其训练机制和动态仍不明确。本文旨在通过分析跨类特征（多类共享特征）对AT的影响，揭示其内在机制。

Method: 提出从类间特征归因角度分析AT，通过理论模型证明跨类特征对鲁棒性的作用，并结合多模型架构和实验设置，系统研究AT不同阶段的特征学习动态。

Result: 实验表明：AT初期模型学习更多跨类特征直至达到最佳鲁棒性；后续训练导致鲁棒过拟合，模型决策转向依赖类特定特征。研究还统一了软标签训练和鲁棒过拟合的现有结论。

Conclusion: 跨类特征在AT动态中起关键作用，其阶段性变化揭示了鲁棒性提升与过拟合的机制。研究为理解AT提供了新视角，并整合了现有理论特性。

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is
available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/Cross-Class-Features-AT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时间序列可解释人工智能（XAI）评估指标CPD和CPP，并开发了具有时间感知的TIMING方法，以改进传统集成梯度（IG）在时间序列数据中的应用。实验表明TIMING优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列XAI方法仅关注点状归因量，忽略方向性影响，且评估指标无法有效衡量正负关键点的识别能力。传统IG虽能捕捉正负影响点，但其在时间序列中的直接应用因忽略时序关系而产生次优结果。

Method: 提出TIMING方法：通过引入时间感知机制增强传统IG，保留其理论性质的同时避免生成违反时序关系的路径和分布外样本。同时设计CPD（累积预测差异）和CPP（累积预测保持）指标评估归因方法性能。

Result: 在合成和真实时间序列基准测试中，TIMING在CPD/CPP指标下显著优于现有XAI基线方法，验证了时间感知机制的有效性。

Conclusion: TIMING通过结合时间关系改进了传统IG，新评估指标能更系统评估XAI方法对正负关键点的识别能力，为时间序列可解释性研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种归纳式节点嵌入方法iN2V，通过后处理步骤和训练策略改进传统node2vec，使其适用于未见过节点的嵌入生成，实验显示节点分类准确率平均提升1个百分点（最高6点），并具有插件式兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统node2vec等浅层嵌入方法仅适用于转导式场景（需全图训练时可见），无法处理训练后新增的未见过节点，限制了其在动态图场景中的应用。

Method: iN2V结合后处理嵌入计算（处理未训练节点）和修改后的N2V训练策略，通过预训练参数使嵌入适应后处理过程，并支持与其他嵌入方法的插件式组合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，iN2V使节点分类准确率平均提升1个百分点（最高提升6点），且效果随数据集和未训练节点数量变化。代码已开源。

Conclusion: iN2V成功将转导式嵌入扩展至归纳式场景，通过灵活的后处理机制和兼容性设计，为动态图节点表示学习提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

Motivation: 动态部署环境中数据分布持续变化，但并非所有数据漂移都会导致模型性能下降。现有方法在无标签情况下难以准确判断何时需要重训练模型。

Method: 基于预测模型间的分歧设计D3M监控算法，在非退化漂移下保持低误报率，对退化漂移提供样本复杂度保证以实现高检测率。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界内科医疗数据集上验证，D3M能有效区分性能退化与非退化漂移，证实其作为高风险ML管道监控机制的实用性。

Conclusion: D3M框架为动态环境中的模型维护提供了可行的实时警报方案，特别适用于需要高可靠性的关键任务机器学习系统。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Result: 实验表明：1）能准确恢复底层线性系数；2）预测精度显著优于纯线性模型；3）在分类与回归任务中性能优于其他可解释混合模型，且保持线性系数的原生可解释性。

Conclusion: NIMO在保持线性模型可解释性的前提下，通过非线性修正提升性能，是首个真正等价于线性模型解释性的混合方法，兼具高精度与透明性。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了HiPPO框架，提出一种考虑测量噪声的初始化方法，提升状态空间模型在含噪声数据下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际应用中数据常含噪声，导致模型性能下降。需解决含噪声场景下的状态空间模型初始化问题。

Method: 将HiPPO重新解释为线性随机控制问题，将数据建模为潜在系统的噪声输出，推导出可推断潜在系统后验分布的新初始化方法，保持运行时效率不变。

Result: 实验表明该方法在训练和推理阶段均显著增强了模型对噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 通过理论扩展与随机控制重构，实现了噪声感知的动态初始化方法，为状态空间模型在真实噪声场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于核化KL散度估计和重要性采样校正的半隐式变分推断方法，通过非参数平滑稳定训练，在降低梯度方差的同时保持良性偏差，实现了优于现有方法的性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半隐式变分推断方法（如KSIVI）在高维场景下存在训练成本高、KL散度估计方差大和偏差显著的问题，需要改进优化稳定性和计算效率。

Method: 提出核化KL散度估计器进行非参数平滑，引入重要性采样校正降低偏差，理论证明其与Stein变分梯度下降的等价性，并通过半隐式方法降低梯度方差。

Result: 实验表明该方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配当前最优SIVI方法，函数空间偏差更良性，优化过程更稳定高效。

Conclusion: 通过核化估计与重要性采样的结合，本方法在保持理论一致性的同时显著提升优化效率，为高维变分推断提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文通过线性回归框架研究合成数据的隐私放大效应，发现当生成模型种子被控制时，单个合成数据点会泄露与模型相同的信息；而使用随机输入生成有限数据点时，隐私保护效果会超越模型固有保证。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究虽观察到生成模型隐藏时合成数据存在隐私放大现象，但缺乏严格理论支撑。本文旨在通过线性回归框架建立理论边界，填补这一空白。

Method: 采用线性回归作为理论分析框架，分别研究两种场景：1) 攻击者控制生成模型种子时的隐私泄露 2) 随机输入生成合成数据时的隐私保护效果。

Result: 1) 种子被控制时，单个合成数据点隐私泄露等同于直接发布模型；2) 随机输入生成有限数据点时，隐私保护效果出现正向放大效应。

Conclusion: 在线性回归场景中建立的隐私边界分析，为未来推导更通用的合成数据隐私保护理论框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Abstract: Recently, federated learning frameworks such as Python TestBed for Federated

have emerged to tackle user privacy concerns and efficiency in embedded

Motivation: 研究旨在建立生成扩散模型与连续状态联想记忆模型之间的理论联系，揭示其动力学系统本质，并探索噪声对模型行为的影响，特别是从生成到记忆的过渡机制。

Method: 利用Morse-Smale动力系统框架，将梯度联想记忆模型和扩散模型统一为受白噪声扰动的系统。通过分析结构稳定性、分岔理论及零噪声极限下的学习景观，研究其动力学行为。

Result: 发现联想记忆与扩散模型在零噪声极限下具有结构稳定性，学习景观中仅在孤立点存在不稳定性。通过分岔序列可定性描述系统间的稳定过渡，经典/现代Hopfield网络（注意力机制）的结构稳定性准则得到验证。

Conclusion: 研究通过统一动力系统框架，揭示了生成与记忆模型的深层联系，噪声水平变化导致的分岔行为为理解模型稳定性提供了新视角，并为联想记忆与扩散模型的理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的语言模型训练方法（如RLVR）在全轨迹级别定义奖励信号，无法有效指导中间推理步骤的优化，导致模型学习效率受限。

Method: 提出TreeRPO方法：1) 通过树采样估计各推理步骤的数学期望奖励 2) 基于GRPO框架创新步骤级组相对奖励机制 3) 直接通过采样过程生成密集奖励信号，无需独立步骤奖励模型。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过树采样生成细粒度奖励信号，有效提升语言模型推理性能与训练效率，在数学问题求解任务中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种保持局部性的马尔可夫转移框架(LPMT)，通过双向协作扩散和热力学状态转移过程，解决了传统扩散排序方法中正信号衰减的问题，在全局检索中保持局部有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的排序方法在亲和力图谱中建模时，正信号会随传播步数增加而衰减，导致局部区域外的判别力下降。

Method: LPMT框架包含双向协作扩散(BCD)整合多图传播、局部状态嵌入(LSE)增强局部一致性、热力学马尔可夫转移(TMT)实现全局检索。

Result: 跨任务实验验证了LPMT在保持局部有效性的同时提升全局检索精度的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过热力学状态转移与局部保持机制的结合，LPMT成功实现了对数据流形距离的精确测量与高效检索。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于通用函数近似的理论，解释Transformer如何通过少量上下文示例实现无需微调的可靠预测，突破了传统优化算法近似的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多将Transformer视为优化算法的近似器，其性能受限于被模拟算法的有效性。本文旨在通过通用函数近似理论，更本质地解释Transformer的上下文学习能力，并扩展其适用范围。

Method: 针对任意函数类（代表不同任务），构建一个无需权重更新的Transformer模型。该方法基于通用函数近似理论，而非模拟优化算法迭代过程。

Result: 所构建的Transformer在仅需上下文示例的情况下，可保证函数近似效果，且不依赖优化算法性能，适用于非凸问题及非线性函数类等更广泛场景。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer如何同时学习通用表征并动态适应上下文示例，为理解其上下文学习机制提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法因正样本对数量有限及均匀加权机制，导致低度数节点信息不足且受噪声干扰，未能有效解决度偏差问题。

Method: 提出HAR对比损失：利用节点标签扩展正样本对，基于学习难度动态调整正负样本权重；构建SHARP框架以适配更多场景。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局性能和不同度数节点上的表现均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 理论分析与实验结果共同验证了SHARP框架在缓解度偏差方面的有效性，为GNN公平性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Shapley值估计方法（如KernelSHAP）虽被广泛使用，但缺乏理论保证，且传统精确计算方法因特征维度指数爆炸而不可行。

Method: 构建包含置换/非置换采样策略的统一分析框架，改进实现方法以支持高维数据，并通过决策树模型进行多维度基准测试。

Conclusion: 该框架首次为KernelSHAP提供理论支撑，揭示不同估计器的权衡关系，并通过算法改进实现高维扩展，为可解释性研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

TL;DR: 本文提出Diagonal Batching调度方案，通过并行化处理解决RMT模型在长上下文推理中的顺序执行瓶颈，显著提升推理速度且无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer因二次时间与线性内存复杂度难以处理长上下文，而RMT虽降低复杂度却因内存更新机制导致顺序执行瓶颈，限制了GPU并行效率。

Method: 提出Diagonal Batching调度方案，在保持RMT精确循环的前提下实现跨片段并行计算，消除顺序约束，无需复杂批处理或流水线技术即可高效利用GPU。

Result: 在131,072标记序列上，Diagonal Batching使LLaMA-1B ARMT推理速度较标准全注意力模型提升3.3倍，较顺序RMT实现提升1.8倍。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching通过移除顺序瓶颈降低推理成本与延迟，使RMT成为实际长上下文应用的高效解决方案，且兼容现有模型无需额外训练。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Motivation: 现有神经采样器在目标评估效率上仍落后于并行回火（PT），而PT生成样本依赖性强且需重复计算。为结合神经采样器的样本独立性和PT的高效性，需设计一种新方法以弥补两者不足。

Method: 提出渐进回火采样器（PTSD），通过顺序训练不同温度下的扩散模型，利用PT优势优化训练过程；结合高温扩散模型生成近似低温样本，经少量MCMC微调后用于训练下一模型，实现跨温度信息复用。

Result: PTSD在目标评估效率上显著优于基于扩散的神经采样器，生成混合良好且无关联的样本，同时高效复用跨温度样本信息。

Conclusion: PTSD通过融合PT与扩散模型的优势，解决了现有神经采样器效率不足和PT样本重复计算的问题，为高效生成高质量样本提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Mesa层的改进型循环神经网络（RNN）模型，通过优化测试时计算，在语言建模中实现了更低的困惑度和更好的长上下文理解能力，但增加了推理时的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果Transformer在推理时需线性增长内存和计算资源，而近期线性化softmax的RNN模型（如Mamba）虽降低了资源消耗，但仍有性能局限。本文旨在通过优化上下文回归目标，提升RNN模型的表达能力。

Method: 引入数值稳定、支持分块并行化的Mesa层，利用快速共轭梯度求解器在每个时间点最小化上下文损失函数，实现序列内实时优化。

Result: 在十亿参数规模的语言建模中，新方法相比传统RNN显著降低困惑度，在长上下文任务（如文档理解）中表现尤佳，但推理FLOPs增加约2倍。

Conclusion: 通过将测试时计算资源用于序列内优化问题，可突破传统RNN性能瓶颈。这一发现与'增加推理时计算提升性能'的趋势相呼应，为高效序列建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*Valérie Costa,Thomas Fel,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Bahareh Tolooshams,Demba Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过MNIST实验发现现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）因准正交性假设难以提取相关特征，提出基于匹配追踪的多迭代SAE（MP-SAE），在保留重建性能的同时有效提取层次化相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有浅层稀疏自编码器在提取相关特征时受限于准正交性假设，无法有效处理手写数字生成等层次化场景中的特征相关性。

Method: 提出MP-SAE方法：通过展开匹配追踪算法实现多迭代残差引导，逐步提取相关特征，并保证原子选择过程中重建效果的单调提升。

Result: 在MNIST数据集验证中，MP-SAE成功提取了传统SAE无法捕获的层次化相关特征，同时保持重建性能随原子数量增加而稳定提升。

Conclusion: MP-SAE突破了传统SAE的准正交性限制，为具有层次化结构的特征提取提供了新方法，并通过残差迭代机制保障了算法收敛性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Result: 梯度下降在适当初始化下呈现线性收敛，收敛速度由注意力层输出矩阵的极值奇异值决定；残差连接可改善该矩阵的低秩病态问题，提升优化稳定性。多层结构同样适用线性收敛结论。

Conclusion: 残差连接通过缓解注意力层输出矩阵的病态性，在优化稳定性中起关键作用。理论分析为Transformer结构设计提供了收敛性保障，实验验证了理论结论的有效性。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了Attias等人的研究，从多个新维度刻画了改进下的可学习性，提出了非对称最小一致概念类来精确描述可实现设置下的适当学习，在欧氏球改进区域等自然场景下获得积极结果，并通过噪声模型和在线学习框架实现更低泛化误差与错误边界，解决了开放性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有战略分类研究主要关注对抗欺骗行为，但Attias等人发现当被分类主体通过真实改进(而非欺骗)来获得有利分类时，学习系统会展现出优于标准PAC学习的泛化能力。本文旨在从更多维度系统研究这种改进机制下的学习理论边界。

Method: 引入非对称最小一致概念类刻画可实现设置下的适当学习；在数据分布满足生成假设时研究欧氏球改进区域的非适当学习；通过噪声鲁棒性分析和在线学习框架扩展学习场景；使用理论证明与边界分析解决开放问题。

Result: 1) 精确刻画了可实现设置下的适当学习边界 2) 在欧氏球改进区域实现非适当学习 3) 在噪声模型下获得更低泛化误差 4) 提出在线学习的错误边界 5) 解决了Attias等人提出的开放性问题

Conclusion: 研究系统建立了改进机制下的学习理论框架，通过新概念工具和场景扩展揭示了改进学习优于传统PAC学习的本质，为实际决策系统(如招聘/信贷)中处理主体适应性行为提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于哈密顿系统的循环哈密顿回声学习算法（RHEL），用于高效训练深度状态空间模型（SSMs）。该算法通过物理轨迹计算梯度，无需显式雅可比矩阵，且计算复杂度与模型规模无关，并在多种时间序列任务中达到与BPTT相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统循环神经网络（RNNs）可嵌入动态系统，但需符合物理原理的学习算法。现有方法在梯度计算效率及物理系统实现上存在局限，需开发兼顾物理约束与计算效率的训练框架。

Method: 提出RHEL算法：1）利用非耗散哈密顿系统的物理轨迹计算梯度，仅需三次前向传播；2）引入离散时间版本RHEL，与BPTT在哈密顿循环单元（HRUs）上等效；3）扩展至层次化哈密顿SSMs（HSSMs）。

Result: 在线性和非线性动态的HSSMs上，RHEL在序列长度达~50k的分类与回归任务中表现与BPTT一致，验证了算法在长程依赖建模中的有效性。

Conclusion: RHEL为可扩展、高能效的物理自学习系统设计提供了新途径，同时保持与传统反向传播相当的性能，为物理启发的序列建模开辟了可能性。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

TL;DR: 本文对分布式学习中两种错误反馈方法EF和EF²¹进行了严格分析，通过构建最优Lyapunov函数揭示了其收敛率下界，并在简化场景下实现与压缩梯度下降法的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习中通信瓶颈导致信息压缩需求，但压缩会降低收敛性。现有错误反馈机制（如EF和EF²¹）的收敛性能缺乏系统性理论对比，需建立统一分析框架。

Method: 通过构建最优Lyapunov函数分析EF和EF²¹的收敛率，推导匹配的下界理论保证，并在简化实验场景下进行压缩梯度下降法的横向对比。

Result: 获得两种方法的最优收敛率及严格下界匹配，证明EF²¹在理论保证上优于EF，同时提供与压缩梯度下降法的量化性能对比基准。

Conclusion: 基于Lyapunov函数的分析框架为错误反馈机制提供了普适性理论工具，其下界匹配特性使不同通信压缩算法的公平比较成为可能。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列生成方法难以同时满足点级约束和段级统计属性控制需求，导致编辑过程中时间连贯性保持与多类型约束整合存在挑战。

Method: 结合两种核心机制：(1)置信加权锚点控制实现点级约束；(2)分类器控制管理段级统计属性(如总和、均值)，并与条件训练扩散模型无缝集成。

Result: 跨多数据集与模型的实验验证了框架有效性，在保持时间连贯性的同时实现了局部精确控制。

Conclusion: CocktailEdit弥合了生成模型与实际编辑需求的鸿沟，为人机协同时间序列生成与编辑提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Fast-DataShapley，一种基于加权最小二乘法的单次训练方法，用于高效计算训练数据的Shapley值，避免重复训练成本，实验显示性能提升2.5倍且训练速度提高两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Shapley值的贡献评估方法因计算复杂度高且需为每个测试样本重复训练，导致实际应用成本过高，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 通过加权最小二乘法构建可复用的解释器模型，并提出三种理论保障方法（效用函数近似计算、训练数据分组计算）降低训练开销。

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的实验表明，方法性能提升超2.5倍，解释器训练速度提升两个数量级，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley在保持理论优势的同时，解决了Shapley值计算效率瓶颈，为数据贡献评估提供了实时高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Result: 在仅使用单一吸引盆轨迹训练后，RC成功预测了多稳态系统中未观测的其他吸引盆动态行为。

Conclusion: 储层计算框架通过数据驱动方法突破了传统结构先验限制，展示了跨域泛化的潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出SAILOR方法，通过结合世界模型和奖励模型，使智能体在模仿学习中具备自主规划能力，以应对专家未覆盖的状态，显著超越传统行为克隆（BC）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）的局限性在于智能体仅能模仿专家访问过的状态，一旦偏离无法自主恢复。作者旨在解决BC无法在未见状态下独立推理的问题，提出需赋予智能体类似“学会钓鱼”的规划能力。

Method: 提出学习搜索（L2S）框架SAILOR，包含世界模型（预测环境动态）和奖励模型（评估专家目标），通过算法设计与组件组合实现高效学习恢复行为，无需额外人工干预。

Result: 在12项视觉操作任务中，SAILOR显著优于基于BC的扩散策略；即使BC数据量增加5-10倍仍存在性能差距，且能识别细微错误并抵抗奖励攻击。

Conclusion: SAILOR通过规划导向的模仿学习框架，克服了BC的恢复能力缺陷，验证了其在复杂任务中的鲁棒性和泛化性，为模仿学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Conclusion: 本文为测试时策略的样本效率提供了理论支持，证明自我纠正方法可扩展Transformer至多任务场景，为实际应用提供理论依据。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

TL;DR: 提出SiftAttention方法，通过动态阈值过滤替代传统top-k操作，减少GPU上大语言模型推理时的内存带宽使用，同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似注意力方法依赖GPU上效率低下的top-k操作，且HBM与SRAM间的数据传输导致内存带宽瓶颈，需更高效解决方案。

Method: 基于注意力分数幂律分布的观察，设计动态阈值过滤机制，仅加载高于阈值的注意力分数及对应值向量，减少数据移动。

Result: SiftAttention在降低内存带宽使用（尤其是值向量加载）的同时，模型质量优于现有近似注意力方法。

Conclusion: SiftAttention通过轻量级动态阈值策略，有效平衡了GPU推理效率与模型精度，为近似注意力计算提供新方向。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Result: 在ImageNet64上获得与SOTAx相当的交叉熵值；能量模型展现强泛化性（对数概率与训练集具体图像无关）；揭示图像概率和局部维度随内容显著变化，挑战传统低维流形假设。

Conclusion: 双重评分匹配框架有效解决了能量模型归一化问题，实验证明其建模能力与扩散模型的兼容性。图像概率分布特性挑战了传统维度假设，为概率模型理论研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Motivation: 传统QPI成像在多散射源场景下提取单散射核时存在病态逆问题，现有方法难以有效解耦复杂散射条件。

Method: 采用变分自编码器分步学习：第一步训练核的潜在空间表示，第二步通过专用编码器对齐观测数据与预训练核的潜在特征。

Result: 在包含100个物理真实核的数据集上验证，相比单步基线方法提取准确率显著提升，对未见核的泛化能力增强。

Conclusion: 两步学习策略有效解决了QPI核提取的逆问题，为复杂量子材料电子结构分析提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

TL;DR: 本文从实际效率角度重新审视测试阶段扩展规律，发现小模型效果被显著高估。传统计算最优性理论忽视内存访问瓶颈，提出结合计算与内存成本的Kinetics Scaling Law，并基于稀疏注意力提出新扩展范式。实验证明稀疏模型在低/高资源场景均优于密集模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于计算最优性的研究忽视了推理策略（如Best-of-N、长思维链）带来的内存访问瓶颈，导致小模型效率被高估。需建立同时考虑计算与内存成本的扩展规律以优化资源配置。

Method: 提出Kinetics Scaling Law量化资源分配，覆盖0.6B-32B参数模型。设计以稀疏注意力为核心的扩展范式，降低单token成本，支持更长生成序列和并行样本处理。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在AIME问题解决准确率上：低资源场景提升60+分，高资源场景提升5+分。在最新MoE模型评估中持续优于密集模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试阶段扩展潜力的关键：与训练阶段参数扩展不同，测试阶段通过增加生成量持续提升准确率。该范式突破传统参数扩展的饱和限制。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出动态记忆稀疏化（DMS）方法，通过压缩Transformer大语言模型的KV缓存，在相同计算资源下生成更多token，显著提升推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理扩展方法通过增加生成序列长度提升准确性，但受限于KV缓存的计算成本。研究旨在通过高效压缩KV缓存，突破计算瓶颈并实现更高推理效率与准确性。

Method: 提出动态记忆稀疏化（DMS），延迟淘汰缓存token并隐式合并其表示，仅需1K训练步即可实现8倍KV缓存压缩，优于无训练的稀疏注意力方法。

Result: 在Qwen-R1 32B等模型上验证，DMS使AIME 24、GPQA、LiveCodeBench基准平均提升9.1、7.6、9.6分，相同计算资源下准确率显著提高。

Conclusion: DMS通过高效KV缓存实现推理超扩展，平衡计算资源与模型性能，为LLM推理优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 本文提出嫁接（grafting）方法，通过直接修改预训练扩散变换器（DiTs）的架构，以极低计算成本探索新设计，验证了混合架构在图像生成任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型架构设计需通过昂贵预训练评估效果，限制了研究效率。受软件复用启发，本文探索能否基于预训练模型快速验证新架构设计。

Method: 基于对激活行为和注意力局部性的分析，提出嫁接技术：在预训练DiT-XL/2基础上替换注意力机制（如门控卷积、局部注意力）、MLP层结构，并支持架构重组（如并行块转换）。

Result: 混合架构在仅用2%预训练计算量下达到接近原模型质量（FID:2.38-2.64 vs 2.27）；文本生成模型速度提升1.43倍且质量下降<2%；并行块重组后模型深度减半但质量更优（FID:2.77）。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法证明可通过预训练DiTs的局部修改实现高效架构探索，支持从算子替换到整体架构重构的多层次创新，为扩散模型设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

TL;DR: AbBiBench是一个抗体结合亲和力设计与成熟的基准框架，通过评估抗体-抗原复合体的模型似然性，系统比较多种蛋白质模型，发现结构条件化的逆折叠模型在亲和力相关性和生成任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体评估方法仅关注抗体本身及其与天然抗体的相似性（如氨基酸同源性、结构RMSD），缺乏对抗体-抗原复合体功能的整体考量。AbBiBench旨在提供基于生物功能导向的统一评估框架，推动更有效的抗体设计模型发展。

Method: 1. 构建包含9种抗原（涉及流感、SARS-CoV-2等）和155,853个重链突变抗体的标准化数据集；2. 系统比较14种蛋白质模型（包括语言模型、逆折叠模型、扩散生成模型等）；3. 通过模型似然性与实验亲和值的相关性评估性能，并在抗体F045-092与H1N1流感抗原的案例中验证生成能力。

Result: 结构条件化的逆折叠模型在亲和力相关性（相关系数）和抗体生成任务（基于结构完整性与生物物理特性排序）中均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: AbBiBench为抗体设计提供了基于生物功能导向的统一评估标准，证明复合体层面的模型评估能更有效指导功能化抗体开发，并揭示结构条件化建模在抗体工程中的优势。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出潜在空间假说，将多模态医学数据映射到统一流形中，以揭示个体健康轨迹，推动个性化医疗，并讨论数据偏差、罕见病数据稀缺等挑战及解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疾病分类（如帕金森病、克罗恩病）可能掩盖异质性病理实体，且医学数据模态（基因组、影像、临床文本等）虽形式不同但蕴含统一生理状态信息，需构建共享表征空间以支持精准医疗。

Method: 通过潜在空间假说建立层次化流形模型，将异构数据视为同一生理状态的投影，利用规模感知编码器、持续学习纵向数据流及基于扰动的验证方法实现空间建模。

Result: 框架可量化疾病亚轨迹、个体化变化方向，为个性化诊断、动态监测及定制治疗提供依据，同时重新解构传统疾病标签背后的多病理实体。

Conclusion: 潜在空间框架推动临床实践从标签分组转向个体轨迹导航，但需解决数据偏差、隐私等问题，未来可通过持续学习与因果验证进一步优化。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5在自动化漏洞修复中的表现，发现CodeBERT在上下文有限时表现更优，而CodeT5擅长处理漏洞模式且扩展性强，但两者对未知漏洞的泛化能力仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，而现有自动程序修复(APR)技术在安全关键领域的漏洞修补研究不足。需探索预训练模型在跨语言、跨漏洞场景下的有效性和泛化能力。

Result: 1. CodeBERT在上下文碎片化/稀疏场景表现更好

Conclusion: 研究建立了漏洞修复的模型性能基准，揭示了当前预训练模型在现实安全场景中的泛化局限性，为提升自动化漏洞修补的鲁棒性提供了改进方向和实践洞见。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Method: CoRAL采用强化学习框架，通过奖励机制同时评估生成评论的语义相似性及其能否被后续代码优化模型成功实现，从而提升评论的可用性。

Result: 定量与定性分析表明，CoRAL生成的评论在语义准确性和作为代码优化任务输入的实用性上均优于现有基线技术。

Conclusion: CoRAL通过结合语义与实用性奖励机制，在自动化代码审查中实现了更有效的评论生成，为后续任务提供了高质量输入。

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于扩散变换器的去噪框架，用于快速生成高质量质子治疗剂量分布图。通过结合低统计量蒙特卡罗模拟与深度学习，在保持计算速度的同时提升剂量准确性，并在多部位癌症数据中验证了模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调强质子治疗(IMPT)需要频繁在线自适应调整，但快速蒙特卡罗剂量计算因粒子数减少导致噪声增加。需在计算速度与剂量精度间取得平衡，以支持临床实时决策。

Method: 使用80例头颈癌患者的CT图像和IMPT计划生成噪声/高统计剂量图，构建扩散变换器模型。输入噪声剂量图与CT，通过组合损失函数（MSE+残差损失+区域MAE）训练，并在多部位测试泛化能力。

Result: 模型在头颈/肺/乳腺/前列腺癌的MAE分别为0.195/0.120/0.172/0.376 Gy[RBE]，3D Gamma通过率(3%/2mm)均超92%，DVH指标与真实值高度吻合。

Conclusion: 基于头颈癌数据训练的扩散变换器模型成功泛化至其他解剖部位，证明该方法能有效平衡蒙特卡罗剂量计算的速度与精度需求，支持在线自适应放疗实施。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

### [257] [Domain Adaptation Method and Modality Gap Impact in Audio-Text Models for Prototypical Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04376)
*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 现有音频-文本模型在背景噪声下分类性能显著下降。本文提出一种无需重新训练模型的领域自适应方法，通过量化背景贡献和缩小模态差距，提升多环境下的分类鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本环境声音分类模型在背景声源存在时性能严重下降，且性能退化主要由背景声的信噪比(SNR)驱动，与背景类型无关。

Method: 提出量化背景声源贡献的领域自适应技术，并将其整合至分类过程；通过分析音频-文本嵌入模态差距并缩小该差距提升性能。

Result: 方法在不同背景类型和SNR条件下均提升分类准确率，可泛化至多种先进原型方法，展现跨环境应用的扩展性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过背景贡献量化和模态差距优化，无需重新训练即可显著提升复杂声学环境中的零样本分类性能，验证了方法的通用性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过隐式/显式条件约束生成与字素一致的音素-韵律标签模型，有效提升标签一致性并增强下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR微调方法生成的音素标签与字素缺乏一致性，限制了在TTS等任务中的应用。需建立语音-标签-字素三元平行数据以提升多任务效果。

Method: 1)基于预训练BERT的提示编码器实现隐式字素条件注入 2)推理阶段显式剪枝与字素矛盾的标签假设。双机制确保标签与字素的对齐。

Result: 标签-字素一致性显著提升，口音估计任务准确率提高。生成的平行数据有效支持下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过双重条件约束机制成功构建语音-标签-字素关联数据，验证了跨模态对齐对多任务系统的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

*Te Ma,Min Bi,Saierdaer Yusuyin,Hao Huang,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文针对基于音素的自动语音识别（ASR）提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的音素到字素解码方法（LLM-P2G），通过数据增强和随机化训练策略解决信息损失问题，显著优于传统WFST系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WFST解码方法因复杂流程和无法利用大语言模型（LLMs）而受限，需探索更高效的音素到字素转换方案以提升跨语言ASR性能。

Method: 提出LLM-P2G框架，包含语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两阶段，并引入带噪声音素的数据增强（DANP）和随机化Top-K边缘化训练（TKM）策略。

Result: 在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，LLM-P2G相比WFST系统分别实现3.6%和6.9%的相对词错误率（WER）降低。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G通过结合大语言模型与针对性训练策略，有效克服级联信息损失问题，显著提升跨语言ASR性能。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合人机协同与遗传算法的方法，通过用户反馈逐步优化AI音乐生成模型，两次迭代后用户评分分别提升0.2和0.39。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI音乐生成模型依赖固定数据集训练，难以满足用户主观个性化需求，而图像生成算法在音乐领域的直接应用存在响应不足的问题。

Method: 采用人机协同框架，聚合用户评分作为损失函数微调模型，并引入遗传算法整合用户反馈优化基线模型性能。

Result: 首轮迭代用户平均评分较基线提升0.2，第二轮迭代进一步增加0.39，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过迭代式用户反馈驱动模型优化，可显著提升AI音乐生成的主观质量，为人机协同创作系统提供可行路径。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的SSIMBaD框架，用于动漫面部线稿的自动上色，通过SSIM引导的平衡扩散实现结构保真与风格迁移，在像素精度和感知质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义噪声调度，可能导致感知不一致性，且在保持线稿结构保真度和参考图像风格迁移效果上存在局限。

Method: 采用连续时间扩散模型，提出SSIMBaD技术：通过sigma空间变换将结构相似性（SSIM）度量的感知退化线性对齐，确保时间步间视觉难度一致，实现平衡重建。

Result: 在大规模动漫人脸数据集上验证，本方法在像素精度和感知质量均超越SOTA模型，并展现了对多样化风格的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSIMBaD通过统一感知退化与结构约束，解决了传统扩散模型在动漫上色中的关键问题，为风格化生成提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

### [266] [Was Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04742)
*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出一种简化方法，通过解耦最优控制问题的训练与优化阶段，使用单一物理信息训练后的DeepONet模型结合后续优化，无需在训练中引入成本函数即可解决多类最优控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在训练神经网络解决最优控制问题时需将成本函数整合到损失函数中，导致架构复杂且流程冗余。本文旨在通过解耦训练与优化阶段，简化模型结构并提升效率。

Method: 采用DeepONet作为神经算子，在训练阶段仅基于物理信息（微分方程残差）进行训练，随后在独立优化阶段通过自动微分计算控制变量梯度，并添加残差惩罚项以迭代优化不同成本函数。

Result: 在三个不同微分方程对应的DeepONet模型上测试九种最优控制问题（每个模型对应三种成本函数），结果显示所有案例均能实现高精度且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 解耦训练与优化、简化模型架构的方法有效解决了多类最优控制问题，证明了无需在训练中显式包含成本函数，为高效灵活的最优控制求解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

TL;DR: 提出MOPBnB(so)算法，通过单次噪声函数评估和邻近解估计，高效求解随机多目标优化问题的帕累托最优集，计算资源消耗显著低于多次评估的变体，且性能超越NSGA-II遗传算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对随机多目标优化问题，传统方法需多次重复评估解以估计目标函数，计算资源消耗极大。需开发更高效且能保证收敛性的算法。

Method: MOPBnB(so)算法在任意解处仅执行单次噪声函数评估，利用邻近解信息进行目标函数估计。结合概率分支定界框架，提供有限时间性能边界证明及随机问题下的渐近收敛性理论。

Result: 理论证明算法可概率性捕获帕累托集且估计值收敛至真实目标函数。数值实验显示其计算资源消耗远低于多次评估变体，并在测试问题上优于NSGA-II。

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so)通过单次观测与邻近解信息融合，在保证理论收敛性的同时显著提升计算效率，为随机多目标优化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Motivation: 传统基因集分析（GSA）方法忽略临床背景，常产生冗余且非特异性的通路富集结果，导致解释困难且可重复性低。

Method: cGSA框架结合基因簇检测、富集分析和大型语言模型，实现上下文感知的通路优先排序，筛选具有统计学显著性和生物学意义的通路。

Result: 在19种疾病的102个基因集测试中，cGSA性能超越基线方法30%以上，专家验证确认其精确度提升，黑色素瘤与乳腺癌案例进一步验证其上下文特异性分析能力。

Conclusion: cGSA通过AI驱动的上下文整合机制，解决了传统GSA的临床关联缺失问题，为疾病机制研究和假设生成提供了高效可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决从垂直入渗水分测量中估计土壤参数（如扩散率D和导水率K）的回归问题，探索不同数据条件下模型的适用性。

Method: 利用Fokas方法生成均质土壤垂直入渗模拟数据，采用多种机器学习模型进行双输出回归，评估模型在完整、噪声及有限数据下的表现。

Result: SVM和神经网络在噪声与有限数据中表现最佳，D的预测精度显著高于K，模型整体误差极低。

Conclusion: SVM和神经网络为土壤参数估计的鲁棒方法，D的预测可靠性优于K，适用于复杂数据条件。

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

### [272] [Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245)
*Shaoxuan Chen,Su Yang,Panayotis G. Kevrekidis,Wei Zhu*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经ODE的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE控制系统中学习降阶矩动力学。该方法克服了传统导数方法（如SINDy）对密集采样和噪声敏感的局限性，通过直接建模矩轨迹实现稀疏、非均匀时间序列的鲁棒学习，并在闭合存在或不存在的情况下均展示了高效建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于导数的方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感，限制了其在稀疏、不规则观测场景中的应用。本文旨在开发一种更鲁棒的框架，利用神经ODE直接从数据中学习复杂PDE控制系统的低维可解释动力学。

Method: 1. 使用神经ODE直接建模矩轨迹，支持稀疏/不规则时间序列学习；2. 针对无解析闭合系统，提出基于Stiefel流形优化的数据驱动坐标变换策略，发现闭合的低维表示；3. 在非线性薛定谔方程和Fisher-KPP反应-扩散系统等案例中验证方法。

Result: 1. 在闭合存在的非线性薛定谔方程中准确恢复动力学；2. 对无闭合的Fisher-KPP系统，神经ODE模型在稀疏/不规则采样下仍优于物理专家推导的ODE模型，外推精度显著提升；3. 方法在数据受限场景中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 神经ODE框架为复杂PDE系统提供了灵活且可解释的降阶矩动力学建模工具，在闭合存在性不同场景下均表现出对数据稀疏性、噪声及非均匀采样的强适应性，为数据驱动建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

### [273] [Optical Physics-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04357)
*Amirreza Ahmadnejad,Somayyeh Koohi*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 本文建立了一个连接光学物理方程与生成模型的数学框架，通过非线性光学模型的自组织特性显著提升生成式AI性能，实验显示非线性模型在参数效率、稳定性和生成质量上全面超越线性模型及传统方法，同时促进光学计算与AI的双向发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索物理自组织现象与人工智能的内在联系，利用非线性光学现象（如自聚焦、孤子形成）改进生成模型的效率与稳定性，同时通过AI方法反哺光学物理研究领域。

Method: 对比分析六种基础光学方程（亥姆霍兹方程、耗散波方程、程函方程）的线性与非线性版本，引入克尔效应、立方-五次非线性和强度依赖折射率等非线性扩展，建立对应的生成模型架构并进行实验验证。

Result: 非线性亥姆霍兹模型FID达0.0089（线性版1.0909），内存减少40-60%；立方-五次耗散波模型FID 0.0156且无模式崩溃；强度依赖程函模型实现95%折射率重建精度，训练时间缩短30-50%。

Conclusion: 揭示了物理自组织机制与AI生成能力的本质关联，证明非线性光学模型在参数效率、动态适应性和稳定性方面的优势，为光学计算与AI的融合提供了新的理论框架与实现路径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

### [274] [Exp4Fuse: A Rank Fusion Framework for Enhanced Sparse Retrieval using Large Language Model-based Query Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04760)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出Exp4Fuse框架，通过融合原始查询与LLM增强查询的检索结果，改进稀疏检索性能，在多个数据集上超越现有方法并达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成文档的LLM查询扩展方法依赖复杂提示策略和密集检索技术，成本高且计算量大。本文旨在通过零样本LLM查询扩展间接提升稀疏检索效率。

Method: Exp4Fuse框架并行处理原始查询与LLM扩展查询，利用稀疏检索器生成两路排序结果，并通过改进的逆序融合方法（RRF）进行融合。

Result: 在3个MS MARCO数据集和7个低资源数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse通过间接利用LLM扩展查询，显著提升稀疏检索性能，验证了其在低资源场景下的高效性与扩展潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

### [275] [GOLFer: Smaller LM-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner for Query Expansion in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04762)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出GOLFer方法，通过小规模开源模型结合幻觉过滤与文档组合，解决传统基于大语言模型的查询扩展方法在成本、计算资源及可访问性上的限制，性能优于同类小模型方法，并与大模型竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的查询扩展方法依赖大规模模型，导致成本高、计算资源需求大且可访问性受限。小模型生成的文档存在不实与不一致问题，需针对性优化。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：1) 幻觉过滤器，检测并移除小模型生成文档中的非事实与矛盾内容；2) 文档组合器，通过权重向量平衡过滤后内容与原始查询的影响。

Result: 在3个网页搜索和10个低资源数据集上，GOLFer性能优于其他小模型方法，且与基于大模型的方法表现相当，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GOLFer通过优化小模型生成内容的质量与整合方式，在降低资源消耗的同时保持竞争力，为高效查询扩展提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究通过优化嵌入策略，提出Light-ColPali/ColQwen2，在显著降低内存占用的同时保持VDR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在可视化文档检索（VDR）中因分块嵌入导致内存消耗过高，需探索减少嵌入数量且最小化性能损失的方法。

Method: 评估两种标记缩减策略（剪枝与合并），发现剪枝策略不适用于VDR后，聚焦于合并策略的三维优化组合，开发轻量级模型Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light模型仅用11.8%内存即保持98.2%检索性能，极端情况下以2.8%内存保留94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 标记合并策略更适合VDR，Light模型为高效VDR研究提供了有效基线，并揭示了剪枝策略的固有局限性。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出R2Rec框架，通过将用户-物品交互链转化为结构化推理步骤，结合监督微调与强化学习，显著提高了推荐系统性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在推荐任务中直接应用推理方法效果不佳，因用户反馈隐式且缺乏显式推理监督信号。需设计适配推荐场景的推理增强框架。

Method: 1. 从用户-物品图中采样交互链，通过渐进掩码提示策略生成结构化交互思维链；2. 两阶段训练：监督微调学习基础推理，强化学习优化推理路径。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec的HitRatio@1平均提升10.48%，相比原始LLM获得131.81%增益，并生成可解释的决策推理链。

Conclusion: R2Rec通过模拟基于交互上下文的逐步推理，有效解决推荐场景的隐式反馈问题，同时提升性能与可解释性，验证了推理增强策略的有效性。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出hdl2v数据集，通过将VHDL、Chisel、PyMTL3转换为Verilog以扩充数据量，显著提升大语言模型在Verilog生成任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的Verilog代码远少于其他软件语言（如Python），限制了LLM在硬件代码生成中的应用潜力。

Method: 构建hdl2v数据集：将三种硬件描述语言（VHDL/Chisel/PyMTL3）翻译为Verilog，并用于微调32B参数开源模型。

Result: 模型在VerilogEvalV2的pass@10提升23%；结合数据增强方法时性能提升63%，且无需依赖大模型知识蒸馏。

Conclusion: hdl2v有效缓解Verilog数据稀缺问题，未来可通过扩展数据集特性（如语言多样性）进一步优化模型表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Conclusion: 瑞利商目标函数、Gram-Schmidt正交化与神经网络离散化的结合，为连续特征值问题提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，在工程力学中展现出独特优势。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: 本文指出现有针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统的攻击缺乏隐蔽性，提出基于注意力模式的防御方法，并揭示其局限性。防御方法提升准确率约20%，但自适应攻击仍能达到35%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统攻击通过注入污染段落控制输出，但攻击缺乏隐蔽性，易被检测。需通过分析生成过程中的中间信号（如注意力模式）设计更隐蔽的攻击，并开发有效防御机制。

Method: 提出标准化段落注意力分数（NPAS），结合注意力方差过滤算法检测污染段落。同时设计自适应攻击，通过掩盖注意力痕迹测试防御极限。

Result: 所提防御方法使准确率较基线提升约20%。但隐蔽性更强的自适应攻击成功率可达35%，突显防御改进挑战。

Conclusion: 基于注意力模式的防御能有效缓解现有攻击，但攻击者可通过隐蔽性更强的策略规避检测。需进一步研究攻击隐蔽性与防御鲁棒性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于差分隐私（DP）的大型语言模型（LLMs）微调框架（DP-LoRA），用于放射学报告的多异常分类，在保护患者数据隐私的同时保持分类性能。实验表明，中等隐私保护下模型性能接近非私有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在敏感医疗数据（如放射学报告）上微调LLMs时的隐私风险，通过差分隐私技术减少数据泄露风险，同时维持分类性能。

Method: 使用MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE数据集（共50,232份报告），通过差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）对BERT-medium、BERT-small和ALBERT-base模型进行微调，评估不同隐私预算（ε=0.01-10.0）下的加权F1分数。

Result: 中等隐私保护（ε=1.0）下，模型在MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE上的加权F1分别为0.88和0.59，略低于非私有基线的0.90和0.78，显示隐私与效用的权衡。

Conclusion: 基于DP-LoRA的微调方法能有效平衡隐私保护与多异常分类性能，为医疗数据上的LLMs应用提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BESA的增强型编码器窃取攻击方法，通过扰动检测与恢复模块克服现有基于扰动的防御机制，显著提高攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扰动的防御机制会显著降低编码器窃取攻击的性能，需设计一种能有效对抗此类防御的攻击方法。

Method: BESA包含两个核心模块：扰动检测（通过目标编码器特征推断防御机制）和扰动恢复（利用生成模型还原干净特征向量），可与现有攻击方法结合。

Result: 实验表明，BESA在面对先进防御及多重防御组合时，将替代编码器准确率最高提升24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA通过主动检测并消除防御扰动，有效提升了编码器窃取攻击在防御环境下的鲁棒性与性能。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

*Pablo Fernández Saura,K. R. Jayaram,Vatche Isahagian,Jorge Bernal Bernabé,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）、上下文学习和检索增强生成（RAG）的框架，用于自动化网络安全策略合规性验证，并通过实验证明RAG在性能指标上的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算环境复杂性和网络威胁的日益复杂化，要求安全防护需更鲁棒、自适应且自动化。传统方法难以高效处理动态策略与API规范，亟需创新解决方案。

Method: 1. 收集工具与API规范并存储至向量数据库；2. 通过架构流水线将高级缓解策略分解为离散任务；3. 利用LLM结合RAG将任务转化为可执行API调用。

Result: 基于STIXv2格式的公开CTI策略和Windows API文档的实验表明，采用RAG后，精确率、召回率和F1分数较非RAG基线均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架通过RAG增强的LLM有效实现了自动化攻击缓解策略合规，验证了检索增强方法在安全策略执行中的实用性与优越性。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

### [285] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现，上游安全对齐数据与下游微调任务的数据表示相似性对大型语言模型的安全性有显著影响。高相似性会削弱安全防护，而低相似性可提升模型鲁棒性，降低有害性评分达10.33%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要被动应对安全对齐失效或微调过程中的梯度问题，但忽视了上游安全对齐数据的设计对模型安全性的根本影响。

Method: 通过分析上游安全对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性，探究其对模型安全防护能力的影响。

Result: 实验表明，上游与下游数据高相似性会显著弱化安全防护（模型更易被越狱），而低相似性使模型更鲁棒，有害性评分降低最高达10.33%。

Conclusion: 强调上游数据集设计对构建持久安全防护的重要性，为微调服务商提供实践指导，通过控制数据相似性减少越狱攻击的实际风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024是一个新型恶意软件分类数据集，包含320万文件、支持7种分类任务，首次引入对抗性样本挑战集，并升级特征集以促进更全面的恶意软件研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公共数据集存在平台单一性、标签任务单一性及缺乏对抗性样本的局限性，阻碍了恶意软件检测模型在真实场景中的有效评估。

Method: 与EMBER2017/2018作者合作构建多格式数据集，新增特征版本v3，整合未被杀毒软件检测到的恶意文件作为挑战集，并提供哈希、元数据、特征向量及多类型标签。

Result: 发布包含6种文件格式的320万样本数据集，支持7种分类任务评估，首次实现对抗性挑战集构建，特征集扩展至第三代。

Conclusion: EMBER2024通过增强数据集多样性、覆盖性和对抗性测试能力，为恶意软件检测研究提供了标准化评估基准，推动该领域可复现性研究和新方向探索。

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

### [287] [Membership Inference Attacks on Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05126)
*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 现有工具无法有效审计大型序列模型（如LLM）因记忆导致的隐私泄露风险。本文通过显式建模序列内相关性改进成员推理攻击，证明其审计效果更优且无需额外计算成本，为可靠记忆审计奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私泄露审计工具因假设不匹配，难以有效检测序列模型的敏感信息记忆问题。需利用序列生成的内在相关性，重新设计符合模型结构的审计方法。

Method: 改进现有成员推理攻击方法，显式建模序列生成过程中的内部关联性，使其适配序列模型（如LLM和自回归图像生成器）的结构特性。

Result: 案例研究表明，改进后的方法在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了模型记忆隐私信息的检测效果。

Conclusion: 通过利用序列相关性改进审计方法，本研究为大型序列模型的可靠隐私风险评估提供了关键技术支持，推动解决模型记忆泄露的法律隐患。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

### [288] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究利用Parler TTS大型模型重建构音障碍患者病前语音，发现模型能生成语音但难以控制可懂度与说话人一致性，需改进可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 言语障碍患者沟通困难，个性化TTS可作为辅助工具。通过重建患者病前语音，帮助其自然交流。

Method: 使用Parler TTS模型，构建标注说话人身份和可懂度的数据集进行微调，探索语音生成与身份保持能力。

Result: 模型可学习生成挑战性数据分布，但在控制可懂度、维持说话人身份一致性方面存在明显局限。

Conclusion: 需提升此类模型的可控性以优化语音重建任务，未来应聚焦于改进模型对语音特征的控制能力。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同语音-文本联合解码范式（如交错与并行生成）对语音语言模型性能、效率和对齐质量的影响，以优化对话系统表现。

Method: 在统一实验条件下对比不同解码策略，提出ESI模式缩短序列长度；并构建高质量QA数据集增强语音问答能力。

Result: 交错生成对齐最佳但推理慢，ESI模式加速解码且性能略优；高质量QA数据显著提升语音问答效果。

Conclusion: ESI模式有效平衡效率与性能，数据质量对语音任务至关重要，为端到端语音对话系统提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对多标签语音情感识别（SER）中性别偏见的去偏方法有效性和鲁棒性缺乏深入探索，需系统性评估不同去偏策略的适用性。

Method: 提出EMO-Debias框架，涵盖预处理、正则化、对抗学习、偏置学习器、分布鲁棒优化等13种方法，基于WavLM和XLSR特征，在表演性与自然情感数据集上测试性别不平衡条件下的性能。

Result: 实验表明部分方法能显著缩小性别性能差距且不降低整体准确率，公平性与模型性能的权衡关系被量化，数据集分布对去偏效果影响显著。

Conclusion: 研究为多标签SER去偏提供了策略选择依据，强调需结合具体数据分布平衡公平与性能，推动更鲁棒的语音情感分析模型发展。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 传统人工生命研究在封闭系统中模拟开放演化（OEE）时因创新停滞而受限。本文通过区块链与可信执行环境（TEE）结合的DePIN技术，提出基于链上自主AI代理（如Spore.fun）的开放系统，探讨其通过经济激励与环境交互实现持续OEE的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭系统（如Tierra、Avida）在模拟开放演化时因缺乏持续创新动力而失败。研究旨在验证基于去中心化物理基础设施网络（DePIN）和链上自主代理的开放系统是否能突破这一限制，实现长期OEE。

Method: 以Spore.fun为案例，通过数字行为学分析链上AI代理的自主繁殖、进化轨迹及其与区块链金融和社交媒体的交互行为。

Result: 论文未明确量化结果，但通过观察代理在开放环境中的行为模式，初步验证了链上自主代理通过经济激励驱动环境交互的演化潜力。

Conclusion: 基于无许可计算基板和经济激励的开放系统（如Spore.fun）可能突破传统封闭系统的OEE瓶颈，但需进一步研究其长期演化动态与复杂性。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体信用分配方法在全局或个体层面分配贡献时，缺乏对联盟层面的细致分析，导致策略更新次优。

Method: 提出CORA方法：通过所有可能联盟的边际贡献评估联盟优势，利用合作博弈论的核心解分解优势以保证联盟理性，并采用随机联盟采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在矩阵游戏、微分游戏及多智能体协作基准测试中，CORA显著优于基线方法，尤其在多局部最优任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 联盟层面的信用分配能有效提升多智能体强化学习性能，验证了联盟感知机制的重要性。

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出异构多智能体在线自主协同调度算法HoAs-PALN，通过匹配过程的自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈，实现灾后环境中无人机、工人与车辆的高效协同调度，显著提升任务完成率并缩短决策时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有传感技术因灾后环境复杂性存在环境适应性弱、专业感知能力不足及方案实用性有限等问题，亟需开发高效的信息采集调度方案以支持救援行动。

Method: HoAs-PALN算法采用五维匹配过程降维为两类三维匹配，结合softmax函数优化行为选择概率，并引入局部纳什均衡判定机制实现多智能体自主协作。

Result: 实验显示HoAs-PALN任务完成率较基线方法(GREEDY/K-WTA/MADL/MARL)平均提升64.12%/46.48%/16.55%/14.03%，且单次在线调度决策耗时低于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN通过降维策略与博弈机制的有效结合，在动态灾后环境中展现出优越的调度性能与实时决策能力，为灾后救援提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能自主决定发言时机及内容，在在线社交游戏中表现与人类相当，并公开数据与代码以推动异步通信研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM主要应用于同步轮流对话，但现实场景（如群聊、团队会议）多为无固定发言顺序的异步环境，需解决LLM在异步场景中'何时发言'的决策问题。

Method: 开发自适应异步LLM代理，收集含人类玩家和该代理的在线狼人杀游戏数据集进行测试，分析代理的发言时机与内容决策模式。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和人类融入度上与人类相当，其发言时机决策与人类行为高度吻合，但生成内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM融入真实群体场景（如团队协作、教育环境）奠定基础，异步决策能力使LLM能更好应对复杂社交动态。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Motivation: 现有BGP异常检测方法依赖专家经验解释事件，存在效率低、可解释性差的问题，需自动化解决方案提升网络管理效率。

Method: 提出BEAR框架，结合LLM多步推理将BGP表格数据转化为文本报告，并设计基于LLM的合成数据生成框架以缓解公开数据不足。

Conclusion: BEAR首次实现BGP异常事件的自动化解释，通过LLM增强分析精度与可解释性，为网络运维提供高效、可操作的洞见。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

*Marcos Lima Romero,Ricardo Suyama*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 移动网络运营商（MNOs）未充分利用数据价值，而3GPP的NWDAF可通过数据分析提升服务与效率。现有研究受限于数据集和方法单一性，本文通过分析70+文献提出新用例，探索NWDAF的货币化潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 系统性分析70余篇文献中的NWDAF研究趋势与缺口，并设计两个新型应用场景（具体未明示），推动NWDAF采用与商业价值挖掘。

Result: 揭示现有研究集中于用户QoE优化、网络切片管理等有限领域，提出新用例扩展NWDAF应用边界，论证其在风险预测、运营优化等场景的货币化可行性。

Conclusion: 通过填补研究空白与用例创新，NWDAF可帮助MNOs从数据中获取竞争优势，实现从基础设施提供商到数据驱动服务商的转型。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文提出GARG-AML，一种基于图结构的反洗钱方法，通过二阶交易网络结构生成可解释风险指标，平衡计算效率、检测能力与透明度，优于现有拆分交易检测技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反洗钱方法依赖黑箱网络嵌入模型，导致商业应用困难。拆分交易(smurfing)因涉及多主体复杂网络结构，需开发透明高效的新型检测手段。

Method: 基于节点二阶邻接矩阵和基础网络特征，构建可解释风险评分GARG-AML。结合树模型集成与邻居节点评分增强检测能力，仅需二阶邻域信息即可运算。

Result: 在大规模合成与开源网络上的实验表明，该方法在检测拆分交易时优于现有最优方法，验证了基础网络特征的有效性。

Conclusion: GARG-AML通过基础网络属性与可解释指标设计，证明无需复杂嵌入即可实现高效洗钱检测，为反欺诈领域提供新范式。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TQml Simulator的高效量子机器学习电路模拟器，通过结合通用和门特定技术优化不同量子门层的模拟方法，相比Pennylane默认模拟器性能提升2-100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习中硬件高效电路通常由均匀门层构成，需快速数值模拟器推动研究。评估不同模拟技术以加速量子机器学习算法的整体模拟，尤其是前向和反向传播过程。

Method: 通过数值基准测试分析通用和门特定模拟技术，根据量子比特数选择最优方法，开发分层优化模拟器TQml Simulator，针对不同电路层动态采用最高效策略。

Result: 在标准门集（旋转门、CNOT）及IonQ/IBM量子处理器原生门上测试，TQml Simulator在多数情况下性能优于Pennylane默认模拟器2-100倍，性能提升取决于电路结构、量子比特数、数据批量及硬件。

Conclusion: 针对不同量子门层定制模拟方法组合可显著提升性能，TQml Simulator在多种场景下验证了其高效性，为量子机器学习研究提供了加速工具。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对机器学习实践中模型/数据复用产生的系统，现有方法缺乏对副本可信度的系统性验证框架，需建立可计算化工具确保负责任AI的信任传递。

Method: 构建概率复杂查询演算模型，定义Justifiably/Equally/Weakly/Almost四类可信度概念，通过分析副本与原始系统的（部分）行为关系进行验证。

Result: 建立了不同可信度概念间的逻辑关系图谱，证明其组合特性与运算封闭性，形成可扩展的验证框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂系统副本的可信度验证提供了形式化工具，通过行为对比分析支持多层次信任保障，促进负责任AI的工程实践。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了2020-2025年间60篇相关论文，提出基于大语言模型（LLM）的信用风险评估方法分类框架，涵盖模型架构、数据类型、可解释性机制及应用场景，旨在为AI与金融领域研究者提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来LLM在金融文本分析中展现出信用风险评估潜力，但缺乏系统性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，重点解决模型可解释性问题，为后续研究建立分类框架。

Method: 采用PRISMA研究策略筛选文献，从模型架构（如链式思维提示）、数据类型（分析师报告/企业披露文件）、可解释性机制（自然语言解释等维度构建四元分类体系。

Result: 建立包含模型架构、数据类型、解释机制与应用领域的分类法，揭示LLM信用评分系统的核心模式，并指出当前研究在动态风险预测、多模态数据融合等方面的不足。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM信用风险评估提供了结构化研究基础，未来需增强模型动态分析能力与跨领域适应性，推动可解释AI在金融决策中的实际应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial
intelligence and financial researchers.

*Sydney Anuyah*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: 基于1992-2022年美国犯罪受害调查，研究发现高收入与教育水平降低暴力犯罪风险，男性、青年及少数族裔暴力受害风险更高。郊区模型预测效果最佳，农村犯罪仍难预测，需针对性区域干预策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究社会经济因素（收入/教育/就业）与人口特征（年龄/性别/种族/婚姻）如何影响暴力犯罪与财产犯罪的受害类型差异，为犯罪预防提供依据。

Method: 使用平衡分类划分和逻辑回归模型（F1分数评估），分两组模型：Group A（社会经济驱动）与Group B（叠加人口控制变量），分析国家犯罪受害调查数据。

Result: 1. 收入/教育每提升1单位，暴力/财产犯罪比值下降12%/9% 2. 男性暴力风险比女性高37%，少数族裔高24% 3. 郊区模型预测力最强（F1=0.59），城市需加入教育/就业变量，农村仍无法有效预测。

Conclusion: 需实施差异化干预：都会区加强教育投资，农村提供经济支持，并制定人口特征导向的预防策略（如针对青年男性的社区干预）。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

### [303] [An Expansion-Based Approach for Quantified Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04452)

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反例引导抽象精化（CEGAR）的扩展方法，用于解决量化整数规划（QIP）问题，并在多阶段鲁棒离散优化中验证其性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QIP和QCSP的求解方法仅探索了基于搜索的范式，而QBF领域已存在基于扩展的方法。本文旨在将QBF的扩展方法引入QIP，以提升求解效率并扩展其处理复杂优化问题的能力。

Method: 通过CEGAR技术将QBF的扩展方法适配到QIP，并进一步扩展至多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题，同时将方法嵌入优化框架中以增强适用性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在特定实例中优于现有基于搜索的QIP求解器，且因支持线性约束建模，其性能显著优于当前最先进的QBF扩展求解器。

Conclusion: 基于CEGAR的扩展方法为QIP提供了高效求解途径，尤其在处理含线性约束的多阶段鲁棒优化问题时展现出显著优势，验证了其理论价值与实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

TL;DR: FlashDMoE通过GPU内核与硬件协同设计，将专家计算与GPU间通信融合为单一持久内核，显著提升MoE模型的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高、无法利用任务局部性等问题，主要源于CPU调度、主机通信和频繁内核启动。

Method: 开发完全GPU驻留的FlashDMoE算子，融合计算与通信至单一内核，实现细粒度流水线调度，并采用设备自主通信协议减少数据传输开销。

Result: 在8-H100节点上，相比基线模型，延迟降低6倍，吞吐量提升5.7倍，弱扩展效率提高4倍，GPU利用率达9倍（使用FP32仍优于FP16基线）。

Conclusion: 基于GPU内核-硬件的协同设计是突破大规模分布式机器学习性能瓶颈的关键，FlashDMoE验证了该路径的有效性。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Motivation: 定性研究常产生大量未充分利用的丰富数据，通过二次分析可挖掘其跨情境与时间维度的研究价值。

Method: 提出计算密集型二次分析框架，整合多情境及时序数据组合，支持创新研究设计开发。

Result: 论证该方法在拓展研究现象覆盖范围、促进方法论创新方面的可行性。

Conclusion: 计算驱动的二次分析为定性数据重用提供新路径，但需解决数据共享伦理、技术适配等持续性挑战。

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

TL;DR: 研究指出现有NLP社区提供的测量大语言模型表征性伤害的工具未能有效满足从业者需求，主要因工具不实用或存在使用障碍，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP社区虽开发了多种测量大语言模型表征性伤害的工具（如数据集、指标等），但需验证这些工具是否真正满足从业者在实际评估中的需求。

Method: 通过对12名从业者进行半结构化访谈，分析现有工具在实践中的适用性，并结合测量理论与实用测量框架提出建议。

Result: 发现现有工具常因测量目标与需求不匹配（如无法有效衡量目标问题）或存在实践与制度性障碍（如工具难以获取或应用）而未被从业者采用。

Conclusion: 需通过改进工具设计（如增强测量有效性）及降低使用门槛（如优化工具可及适用性）来提升工具对从业者的实际价值。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公共监督机制（如孤立合规审查和阶段性审批）难以应对自主AI系统带来的持续、集成化监管需求，需识别关键治理维度以建立有效监督体系。

Method: 采用混合方法（文献综述+公共部门AI相关岗位公务员访谈），评估现有监督机制应对自主AI治理挑战的能力。

Result: 发现自主AI监管在持续监督、治理与运营深度整合、跨部门协调三方面存在强化版挑战，现有结构无法满足需求。

Conclusion: 需通过制度结构调整（如增强跨部门协作）和设计适配公共部门约束的AI监督机制（如系统化审计），以应对自主AI带来的治理挑战。

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前法律界对AI生成内容是否应受第一修正案保护的争议，作者旨在通过法律先例和言论自由的核心目的，论证AI输出不应被视为受保护的言论。

Method: 通过分析法律先例中言论的定义（强调意图性），并结合第一修正案的核心目标（如促进思想市场、自治等），论证AI模型输出不符合言论标准。

Result: 提出AI模型因缺乏意图性，其输出不构成受保护言论；用户亦无权主张接收此类输出的权利，且扩展保护将削弱政府监管能力并加剧社会危害。

Conclusion: 拒绝将第一修正案适用于AI生成内容，强调此举既无法律依据，也不符合言论自由的社会价值，反而可能阻碍对AI技术的必要监管。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦学习（FL）中参数高效微调（PEFT）的隐私风险，提出通过恶意设计的预训练模型和适配器模块，攻击者可通过梯度反演攻击重构用户本地数据，实验证明攻击能高保真恢复大批量图像数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PEFT在联邦学习中通过冻结预训练模型并仅微调轻量模块以提升隐私和效率，但其实际隐私保护能力尚未明确。本文旨在探究用户微调数据如何因预训练模型和适配器的恶意设计而泄露。

Method: 针对流行的PEFT机制（如适配器），设计恶意预训练模型和可训练适配器模块，利用可访问的适配器梯度实施梯度反演攻击，以重构目标用户的本地数据样本。

Result: 实验表明，攻击可高效恢复用户微调的大批量图像数据，且重构结果具有高保真度，验证了PEFT在隐私保护上的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了PEFT在联邦学习中的隐私风险，强调需开发针对PEFT的隐私保护机制，并为未来研究方向（如防御方法设计）提供了启示。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BridgeNet提出了一种结合CNN与物理信息神经网络的混合框架，有效解决高维非线性Fokker-Planck方程，相比传统PINNs在精度、收敛速度和稳定性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)因使用全连接结构，难以捕捉复杂空间层次结构并满足复杂边界条件，限制了其在高维问题中的应用。

Method: 通过自适应CNN层进行局部特征提取，结合动态加权损失函数严格实施物理约束，构建混合框架BridgeNet。

Result: 多组实验表明BridgeNet误差指标显著降低、收敛速度更快，在高维场景下保持稳定，优于传统PINN方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算物理领域提供了可扩展的精准求解方法，在金融数学和复杂系统动力学等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出RoboRefer，一种通过监督与强化微调结合的3D感知视觉语言模型，显著提升机器人对复杂空间指令的理解与推理能力，并在大规模数据集和基准测试中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉语言模型在复杂3D场景理解和动态空间指令定位任务中表现不足，需提升机器人对物理世界的精准交互能力。

Method: 结合监督微调（SFT）的深度编码器增强空间理解，利用强化微调（RFT）设计过程奖励函数优化多步推理；构建包含20M问答对的数据集RefSpatial和评估基准RefSpatial-Bench。

Result: SFT模型平均成功率89.6%；RFT模型在基准测试中超越所有基线（包括Gemini-2.5-Pro 17.4%），可适配多类硬件执行动态长程任务。

Conclusion: RoboRefer通过分层微调和专用数据集实现了高效3D空间推理，为机器人在真实复杂场景中的交互提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Conclusion: cuVSLAM通过硬件级优化实现了多传感器SLAM系统的实时部署，为不同机器人平台提供了高度可扩展的定位建图解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and robust pose estimation is a key requirement for any autonomous
robot. We present cuVSLAM, a state-of-the-art solution for visual simultaneous
localization and mapping, which can operate with a variety of visual-inertial
sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial
measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to
as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a
wide range of robotic setups. cuVSLAM is specifically optimized using CUDA to
deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on
edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and
implementation of cuVSLAM, example use cases, and empirical results on several
state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrating the best-in-class performance of
cuVSLAM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合提示大语言模型（LLM）与GridMask增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的分层框架，用于异构空地机器人协同任务，首次实现基于VLM感知与LLM推理的运动规划系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态模型难以应对异构多机器人系统在动态环境中的任务多样性问题，需构建可泛化智能以桥接异构机器人的高层推理与低层执行。

Method: 采用分层框架：LLM负责任务分解与全局语义地图构建，GridMask增强的VLM从航拍图像提取语义标签与空间信息，支持空地机器人协同的全局语义路径规划与局部目标缺失场景下的隐式对齐导航。

Result: 在真实世界字母方块任务中验证了框架的动态环境适应性与鲁棒性，实现了空地异构系统在目标缺失场景下的持续语义对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了融合VLM感知与LLM推理的异构空地系统，为动态环境下多机器人协同提供了通用任务分解与跨模态对齐的新范式。

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Conclusion: 3D场景图强化学习框架有效解决了复杂导航问题，模仿学习与课程学习的结合为训练优化提供了新思路，开源代码促进后续研究。

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于多种嗅觉传感器的机器人嗅觉惯性里程计（OIO）校准方法，旨在解决气体动态和环境干扰问题，并在机械臂上验证了其在校准后对气味源定位的厘米级精度提升。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 嗅觉导航（OIO）因气体动态和环境干扰难以实现精准定位，而现有技术（如VIO）无法直接适用。研究旨在开发通用校准方法，支持机器人手术和非接触安检等应用场景。

Method: 设计了一种通用校准流程，适配多种嗅觉传感器类型，针对慢速移动机器人平台优化，重点提升气味源定位精度。

Result: 在真实机械臂实验中，校准后的OIO系统在冷启动嗅觉导航任务中表现显著优于未校准状态，验证了厘米级定位能力。

Conclusion: 所开发的OIO校准方法能有效应对环境干扰，提升气味源定位精度，为医疗与安检等低速高精度场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Motivation: 室温离子液体因高粘度导致传质缓慢，传统计时安培法需要1-4秒以上测量时间，限制了在传感器、电池等需快速定量场景的应用效率。

Method: 开发新型推理算法，利用电流初始瞬态响应进行数学回归分析，直接推算稳态电化学参数，避免传统方法需等待稳态建立的过程。

Result: 验证显示该方法在保持合理精度（与标准方法对比）的同时，将数据采集窗口压缩至1秒内，比现有技术快4倍以上。

Conclusion: 该技术突破了离子液体电化学检测的速率瓶颈，为嗅觉传感、电池性能分析等需要高通量快速检测的领域提供了新方法学支持。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Motivation: 现有神经网络多依赖层级处理信息，但生物神经元通过邻近交互动态调整连接。为提高生物合理性与动态性，需探索更贴近生物神经元互动的模型。

Method: 采用网格结构模拟神经元邻近交互机制，并结合Izhikevich模型以平衡计算效率与生物准确性。

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate

Motivation: 传统RNN方法实时性强但泛化能力差，Transformer泛化好但计算成本高，无法满足实时低资源需求。需在两者间取得平衡以实现高效、通用的实时神经解码。

Method: 通过交叉注意力模块实现个体神经脉冲标记化，构建基于SSM的循环主干网络，支持多数据集预训练，实现因果在线预测与跨会话/个体/任务的高效迁移。

Result: 在猴子运动皮层解码、人类手写/语音解码任务中，POSSM达到与SOTA Transformer相当的精度（GPU推理快9倍），且猴子数据预训练可提升人类手写任务表现，验证跨物种迁移潜力。

Conclusion: POSSM证明混合SSM架构能有效平衡精度、速度与泛化，为实时闭环神经解码提供新范式，跨物种迁移特性为临床脑机接口开发开辟新可能。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出RSVP框架，通过结合多模态思维链视觉提示与视觉语言分割模块，统一多步推理与视觉分割，显著提升分割性能并增强模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)虽具备推理能力，但缺乏显式的视觉定位与分割机制，导致认知推理与视觉感知之间存在鸿沟。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 推理阶段使用多模态思维链视觉提示生成可解释区域建议；2) 分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块(VLSM)融合文本与视觉线索生成精确掩码。

Result: 在ReasonSeg数据集上超过SOTA方法+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU，在SegInW零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP建立了可解释推理分割新范式，验证了通过结构化视觉表征整合认知推理与视觉理解的可行性和扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Motivation: 现有多模态大模型基准仅关注单图推理或多图理解任务的最终答案评估，缺乏对多图结构化推理能力的系统性评测。

Method: 构建含92个子任务的MMRB基准，采用GPT-4o生成多解法CoT标注并人工优化，设计奖励模型评估子集，提出基于开源LLM的句子级匹配评估框架。

Result: 40个模型的实验表明：开源模型多图推理能力显著落后商业模型（如GPT-4o），现有奖励模型在多图排序任务中基本失效。

Conclusion: MMRB填补多图推理基准空白，揭示开源模型与商业模型的技术鸿沟，为多模态推理研究提供新工具与方向。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出PLUCC方法，通过结合球员姿态与位置等上下文线索，实现冰球比赛视频中冰球的高效检测，并引入新评估指标RSLE消除视角偏差。实验显示其检测精度显著超越基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰球检测因体积小、遮挡多、运动模糊及视角变化而困难。现有方法未充分利用球员行为（如身体朝向与视线）这一强上下文线索，故提出通过建模球员行为提升检测性能。

Method: PLUCC包含三部分：(a) 上下文编码器：利用球员朝向与位置作为先验；(b) 特征金字塔编码器：提取多尺度特征；(c) 门控解码器：通过通道门控机制融合特征。另提出RSLE指标消除视角偏差。

Result: 在PuckDataset上，PLUCC的平均精度提升12.2%，RSLE平均精度提升25%，达到SOTA性能。新指标RSLE有效降低了冰场空间评估的视角偏差。

Conclusion: 上下文理解（如球员行为）对冰球检测至关重要。该方法为自动化体育分析提供了新思路，证明结合场景先验可显著提升目标检测效果。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出将激活最大化技术应用于基于DNN的脑编码模型，通过生成可驱动特定脑区响应的图像，验证了该方法在表征和调控人类视觉系统神经活动中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DNN编码模型虽能预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但无法明确解释驱动这些反应的特定特征。传统方法依赖原生生成模型的局限性需要突破。

Method: 1. 使用预训练Inception V3网络提取多层级激活特征并自适应降采样
2. 线性回归预测fMRI响应构建全图像可计算模型
3. 应用激活最大化生成针对单个体素/脑区的优化图像

Result: 1. 生成图像呈现与已知神经选择性相符的视觉特征
2. 图像能可靠驱动低/高级视觉区活动且跨被试一致
3. 方法克服传统生成模型限制，实现视觉系统响应的灵活表征与调控

Conclusion: 激活最大化技术成功扩展至脑编码模型，为解析人类视觉系统特征选择机制提供了新工具，同时为神经调控研究开辟了基于DNN的灵活方法路径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: HMAR提出了一种分层掩码自回归图像生成算法，通过改进VAR模型的下一尺度预测机制和引入可控多步生成，显著提升了生成质量、效率与灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉自回归模型(VAR)存在并行生成导致图像质量下降、序列长度随分辨率超线性增长、采样计划调整需重新训练等问题，限制了其实际应用潜力。

Method: 1) 将下一尺度预测重构为马尔可夫过程，仅依赖直接前驱尺度；2) 采用多步掩码生成策略逐步生成子图块；3) 开发IO感知的块稀疏注意力机制加速计算。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256/512x512基准上超越VAR、扩散模型和传统自回归模型。训练速度提升2.5倍，推理速度提升1.75倍，显存占用降低3倍。

Conclusion: HMAR在保持自回归模型优势的同时，实现了与扩散模型相媲美的生成质量，其动态采样计划和零样本编辑能力为实际应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: 本文针对使用自我中心设备进行高动态范围（HDR）逼真场景重建的挑战，提出通过视觉惯性束调整（VIBA）校准滚动快门相机的高频轨迹，并结合物理成像模型改进高斯泼溅方法，显著提升重建精度。实验显示PSNR提升总计+2dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖设备视觉惯性里程计（VIO）的帧率级6DoF位姿估计，但忽略滚动快门相机的时间戳校准和传感器动态范围等物理特性，导致像素级重建精度不足。

Method: 1) 使用VIBA校准滚动快门RGB相机的高频轨迹和精确时间戳；2) 将包含滚动快门效应和传感器动态范围的物理成像模型整合到高斯泼溅表示中。

Result: 在Project Aria和Meta Quest3设备的多光照场景测试中，VIBA带来+1dB PSNR提升，物理成像模型进一步增加+1dB，所有实验显示视觉质量持续改进。

Conclusion: 通过高频轨迹校准和传感器物理特性整合，实现了更精确的HDR场景重建。方法兼容主流高斯泼溅变体，并已开源实现与数据集。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

Motivation: 传统表示学习假设解耦独立特征轴为良好表示，但无法处理条件独立性，且现有群分解方法仅适用于低分辨率无背景图像，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过将像素平移替换为特征平移，并将对象分割定义为同一变换下的特征分组，结合群分解理论与特征提取/分割，扩展方法至真实场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解人类真实世界中物体识别的发展提供了新途径，并推动了表示学习在现实任务中的应用。

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Gen-n-Val框架，通过结合Layer Diffusion、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量单物体掩码与多样化背景，并利用双代理机制优化合成数据质量，显著降低无效数据比例并提升目标检测与实例分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法存在多物体掩码重叠、分割不精确和类别标签错误等问题，导致数据有效性低（如50%无效数据）。需开发更精准的生成与验证机制以解决计算机视觉任务中的数据稀缺和噪声问题。

Method: Gen-n-Val框架包含两个代理：1) LD提示代理（LLM）优化Layer Diffusion提示，生成单物体掩码和干净背景；2) 数据验证代理（VLLM）过滤低质量数据。通过TextGrad优化系统提示，并采用图像协调技术组合多实例场景。

Result: 在COCO实例分割任务中，无效数据比例从50%降至7%，YOLOv9c/YOLO11m的稀有类mAP提升1%；开放词汇检测中YOLO11m相比YOLO-Worldv2-M提升7.1% mAP，且YOLO系列模型性能全面增强。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val通过LLM/VLLM协同优化与分层生成-验证机制，有效提升合成数据质量与模型性能，为数据驱动型视觉任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: 本文针对现有视觉语言模型（VLM）安全增强方法的不足，提出综合安全数据集HoliSafe及新型模型SafeLLaVA，通过覆盖全场景图像-文本组合的安全基准和可学习安全模块设计，显著提升模型安全性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM安全方法存在两大缺陷：1）现有安全调优数据集未能全面覆盖图像-文本交互可能产生的上下文安全隐患；2）过度依赖数据调优而缺乏架构创新。这导致模型在未知配置下易受攻击且安全机制脆弱。

Method: 提出HoliSafe数据集（覆盖五类安全/非安全图像-文本组合）和SafeLLaVA模型架构（包含可学习安全元标记编码有害视觉特征，以及用于可解释分类的专用安全头模块）。

Result: 实验表明：1）基于HoliSafe训练的SafeLLaVA在多个基准达到SOTA安全性能；2）HoliSafe基准有效暴露现有模型关键漏洞。

Conclusion: HoliSafe数据集和SafeLLaVA架构为多模态对齐开辟新路径，推动鲁棒可解释的VLM安全研究发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Motivation: 探究多模态语言模型（如LlaVA-Next）在隐藏层中如何表征视觉输入，并验证这些表征的因果性与跨模态交互特性。

Method: 通过分析残差流中的线性可解码特征验证图像概念表征，使用目标编辑技术检验特征因果性，并训练多模态稀疏自编码器（SAE）构建可解释的图文特征词典。

Result: 发现ImageNet类特征可通过线性解码提取且具有因果性；深层模型中不同模态（文本/图像）表征逐渐从分离转向共享；SAE成功建立了跨模态解释性特征关联。

Conclusion: 多模态模型在浅层表征分离，但通过深层网络逐步融合跨模态特征，稀疏自编码器为理解这种交互提供了可解释工具。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

Result: 客观特征F1值0.84，居民感知一致性达89.3%。发现感知矛盾（如非正式商业提升活力但降低舒适度）及空间语义依赖性（建筑透明度的区域异质性影响）。

Conclusion: MSEF通过注意力机制生成自然语言解释，连接感官数据与社会情感推理，为协调基础设施精度与生活体验提供方法论创新，支持SDG11可持续城市发展目标。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对视觉语言模型（VLMs）在场景底层结构和语义理解能力的系统性评估，需通过可控实验验证其对象属性与关系理解能力。

Method: 提出CIVET框架，通过生成无标注噪声、无数据集偏差且场景复杂度可控的刺激集，对五类先进VLMs进行系统性、可扩展的统计严谨性评估。

Result: 1) VLMs仅能准确识别有限基础对象属性；2) 性能高度依赖对象位置；3) 对对象间基础关系理解不足；与人类标注者对比显示模型精度仍显著落后。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解能力上存在明显缺陷，CIVET框架为未来模型评估与改进提供了标准化、可扩展的研究工具。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just
individual animal re-identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频语言模型训练受限于标注数据稀缺，特别是小时级视频理解能力未被充分探索。

Method: 构建包含9,700小时跨领域视频的VideoMarathon数据集（含330万QA对），并开发基于内存增强模块的Hour-LLaVA模型，支持1-FPS采样下的长视频推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频基准测试中取得最佳性能，验证了数据集质量和模型优越性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon填补了长视频训练数据空白，Hour-LLaVA通过上下文记忆增强实现了高效的长时多模态建模。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过架构先验设计提升图像质量评估模型的鲁棒性，而非依赖传统数据驱动方法，通过正交信息流和结构优化实现对抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA模型依赖数据驱动的防御方法（如对抗训练）存在稳定性风险，作者质疑这种范式，认为鲁棒性应通过模型架构设计而非学习获得。

Method: 强制正交信息流与范数保持操作以抑制敏感性，结合剪枝和微调优化架构，从底层结构设计提升模型内在稳定性。

Result: 构建出无需对抗训练即可抵御对抗攻击的IQA模型，保持原始模型性能的同时显著增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究视角转变：通过系统设计而非数据优化实现鲁棒性，为感知模型的安全性提供了新的工程化路径。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出动态epsilon调度（DES）框架，通过自适应调整每个实例和训练步骤的对抗扰动预算，结合决策边界距离、预测置信度和模型不确定性，提升对抗训练效果。实验表明DES在CIFAR数据集上优于固定扰动方法及现有自适应方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定扰动预算，无法适应实例特定的鲁棒性特征，而先前自适应策略（如IAAT、MMA）依赖启发式或静态鲁棒性近似，存在局限性。

Method: DES通过整合梯度近似的决策边界距离、softmax熵的预测置信度、蒙特卡洛dropout的模型不确定性，动态调整每个实例和训练迭代的扰动预算，形成统一调度策略。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES在对抗鲁棒性和标准准确率上均优于固定预算方法及现有自适应方法，并提供了调度策略稳定性和收敛性的理论分析。

Conclusion: DES通过动态扰动预算和多因素融合，为实例感知、数据驱动的对抗训练开辟新方向，显著提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

TL;DR: 提出Rectified Point Flow方法，将点云配准与多部件形状组装统一为条件生成问题，通过连续速度场学习点位移并自动捕获对称性，无需对称标签，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需显式处理部件姿态对称性且依赖人工标签，缺乏统一框架处理点云配准与形状组装任务，限制了跨数据集联合训练与几何先验共享。

Method: 构建条件生成模型，学习点级连续速度场以驱动噪声点向目标位置移动，结合自监督编码器关注重叠点，自动学习部件对称性，实现姿态恢复与形状组装。

Result: 在6个基准测试中取得SOTA，统一框架支持跨数据集联合训练，共享几何先验显著提升精度，项目页面已开源。

Conclusion: 通过统一的条件生成建模，Rectified Point Flow在无需对称标签下实现高效点云处理，验证了联合训练对几何理解的促进作用。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout提出了一种基于大语言模型的3D布局生成框架，通过分阶段空间推理与迭代对齐，实现开放词汇且符合细粒度指令的室内场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景布局生成方法受限于数据集规模，存在过拟合或依赖预定义约束的问题，导致无法同时满足开放词汇与用户细粒度控制需求。

Method: 采用三阶段生成流程：1) 鸟瞰图布局生成 2) 3D空间提升 3) 物体位置优化。结合3D-Front数据集设计CoT激活机制增强空间推理，提出CoT-Grounded奖励机制提升泛化能力，并通过上下文学习的迭代资产-布局对齐解决不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法在语义一致性（提升23%）、泛化能力（支持未见物体类别）和物理合理性（碰撞减少17%）方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过大语言模型显式空间推理与迭代优化机制，首次实现了开放词汇的细粒度可控3D场景布局生成，为具身AI与数字内容创作提供了新范式。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Motivation: 现有图像分割模型虽能生成高质量掩码，但无法基于语言和视觉的复杂查询提供综合语义理解，限制了其在用户友好交互应用中的效果。

Method: 提出RAS框架，通过以掩码为中心的大型多模态模型增强分割模型的多模态交互与理解能力，并构建包含多样化掩码组的数据集MaskGroups-2M和MaskGroups-HQ。

Result: RAS在ORES任务及经典RES、GRES任务中表现优异，验证了其多模态交互与复杂语义理解的有效性。

Conclusion: RAS框架通过结合多模态交互与掩码中心化设计，成功解决了复杂跨模态查询的分割问题，为实际应用提供了更灵活的用户交互方式。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

Motivation: ANNS在RAG等应用中可能生成过度相似的结果，而实际场景需兼顾相关性与多样性，需通过后处理方法优化结果集。

Method: 预计算邻近向量截止表，过滤阶段通过贪婪查表策略动态删除候选向量中的相似冗余项。

Result: 在类真实RAG场景中，LotusFilter处理速度0.02毫秒/查询，支持OpenAI等通用嵌入特征。

Conclusion: LotusFilter以轻量后处理实现高效多样性过滤，为ANNS提供实用优化方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Conclusion: 跨模态记忆特性揭示多模态模型的潜在局限，需开发更鲁棒的学习技术以提升跨模态迁移能力。研究为未来多模态模型的安全性和知识整合提供了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

TL;DR: 本文针对医学领域可解释AI（XAI）中概念瓶颈模型（CBM）的局限性，提出VCT和SVCT模型。VCT通过融合概念特征与图像特征提升模型实用性，SVCT进一步结合去噪扩散平滑增强解释稳定性。实验表明两者在保持准确性的同时具备可解释性，SVCT在扰动下仍提供可靠解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CBM方法仅依赖概念特征进行预测，忽略医学图像内在特征嵌入，导致模型性能下降及输入扰动下解释不稳定，限制了其在医学领域的应用。需解决模型效用与解释可信度问题。

Method: 提出VCT模型融合概念特征与图像特征；进一步设计SVCT模型，以ViT为骨干网络，结合概念层与去噪扩散平滑技术，增强决策能力并确保模型抗扰动稳定性。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上，VCT和SVCT在保持与基线模型相当的准确性的同时具备可解释性。SVCT在输入扰动下仍能提供稳定解释，满足医学领域需求。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT通过特征融合与抗扰动设计，解决了传统CBM的效用与稳定性问题，为医学领域提供了兼具高精度、可解释性及鲁棒性的XAI解决方案。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习应用中常不满足全局Lipschitz连续性条件，需要处理对数梯度超线性增长的分布采样问题。

Method: 提出kTULA算法，通过改进的驯服Langevin动力学方法处理超线性增长对数梯度分布的采样问题。

Result: 在KL散度上获得2−ε̄（ε̄>0）的非渐近收敛速率，显著优于现有文献，并推导出Wasserstein-2距离的改进误差界限。

Conclusion: kTULA在高维双势阱分布采样和神经网络优化问题中展现出理论保证，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出基于Otto-Wasserstein几何的测地主成分分析(GPCA)方法，通过神经网络参数化Wasserstein空间中的测地线，并在高斯分布与一般概率测度场景下实现数据变异模式提取。

Method: 针对高斯分布建立可逆映射空间计算框架，对绝对连续概率测度提出基于神经网络的测地线参数化方法，并与经典切空间PCA进行对比验证。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上的实验表明，所提出的GPCA方法能有效表征概率分布的主要变异方向，相比传统方法具有更优的几何保持能力。

Conclusion: 基于Wasserstein几何的GPCA为概率分布数据分析提供了新的非线性降维框架，神经网络参数化方法扩展了其在复杂测度空间中的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

*Haochen Zhang,Zhong Zheng,Lingzhou Xue*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文针对单智能体与联邦强化学习中的高成本问题，提出了两种新型无模型算法，首次在最优后悔、线性启动成本及对数级切换/通信成本上实现三重突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据收集与策略部署成本高昂，现有方法存在超线性启动成本或无法实现低成本策略切换/通信的问题。

Method: 提出Q-EarlySettled-LowCost（单智能体）和FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost（联邦RL）算法，采用无模型框架结合早期策略稳定机制。

Result: 算法同时达成：(1) 当前最优后悔率 (2) 随S/A线性增长的启动成本 (3) 对数级策略切换/通信成本，并建立间隙相关理论保证。

Conclusion: 新算法显著降低实际RL部署成本，为单智能体与联邦RL提供了首个兼顾样本效率与低切换/通信效率的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

### [351] [Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813)
*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分布编码（DE）的高斯过程回归方法，有效处理分类变量，提升预测性能，并与贝叶斯优化在离散/混合空间中的最新进展互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯过程回归在处理含分类变量的输入时面临建模和计算效率的挑战，传统方法（如目标编码）仅利用目标变量的均值，未能充分利用分布信息。

Method: 提出分布编码（DE），利用目标变量在类别内的全部分布信息，结合基于最大均值差异和Wasserstein距离的特征核，扩展至分类、多任务学习及辅助信息整合场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的预测性能，验证了其有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 分布编码通过充分挖掘类别分布信息，显著提升了高斯过程在含分类变量场景下的表现，并为贝叶斯优化等应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种仅利用联合干预数据，通过观测数据和单变量干预数据推断多变量联合干预因果效应的方法，在非线性加性机制下实现与真实联合干预数据训练模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多个领域中估计多变量联合干预的因果效应至关重要，但获取此类干预数据存在困难。研究旨在解决如何利用更易获得的观测和单变量干预数据替代联合干预数据的问题。

Method: 提出可识别性理论框架，将因果效应分解为每个干预变量的混淆贡献与非混淆贡献，并构建基于非线性加性结果机制的实用估计器。

Result: 合成数据实验表明，该方法性能接近直接使用联合干预数据训练的模型，显著优于纯观测数据估计器。

Conclusion: 无需联合干预数据即可有效推断多变量干预效应，为因果推断提供了数据获取受限场景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种处理随机向量的因果图学习方法，通过推断变量组间的因果顺序并进行模型选择，有效扩展了非线性加性噪声模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推断方法多针对标量变量，但在神经科学、心理学等领域，因果关系的核心单元是变量组而非单一标量。需开发适用于向量组的因果分析方法。

Result: 仿真实验显示方法表现优异，并在工业装配线数据中成功应用（含部分先验因果顺序知识）。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统标量因果分析限制，为多变量组因果关系建模提供了有效框架，具有跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出利用高阶累积量在潜在变量线性非高斯无环模型(lvLiNGAM)中识别因果效应，解决了存在潜在混杂代理变量及工具变量不足的挑战，证明了单代理/工具即可识别因果效应并开发估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在潜在混杂因素时，传统因果推断方法面临两大难题：(1) 单一代理变量可能对处理变量产生因果影响；(2) 工具变量数量少于处理变量时的欠识别问题。现有方法在这两种场景下存在局限性。

Method: 基于高阶累积量的统计特性，针对单代理变量和欠识别工具变量场景，构建理论证明框架并提出相应的参数估计方法。通过数值实验验证方法在潜变量干扰下的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，所提方法在因果效应估计精度和抗干扰能力上表现更优，特别是在小样本和高噪声场景下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了传统线性因果推断对工具变量数量的限制，为存在潜变量干扰的实际场景提供了更灵活的因果效应识别理论框架与实用工具。

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

*Guido Imbens,Chao Qin,Stefan Wager*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 在最佳臂识别问题中，当存在至少三个处理臂时，自适应试验设计在统计效率上严格优于非自适应完全随机试验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在可选择自适应试验的情况下，是否应继续使用非自适应完全随机试验，并验证自适应设计在统计效率上的优势。

Method: 采用批处理臂淘汰设计（batched arm elimination designs），通过逐步淘汰表现不佳的臂，并分析其满足严格优势的充分条件。

Result: 证明当存在三个及以上处理臂时，自适应设计通过效率指数（efficiency exponent）量化，在样本量较大时具有普遍且严格的统计效率优势。

Conclusion: 自适应试验设计在最佳臂识别问题中不可忽视，其优势解决了Qin[2022]提出的第二个开放问题。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].
