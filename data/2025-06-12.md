### [1] [LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge: automating error analysis in natural language generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09147)
*Nadezhda Chirkova,Tunde Oluwaseyi Ajayi,Seth Aycock,Zain Muhammad Mujahid,Vladana Perlić,Ekaterina Borisova,Markarit Vartampetian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge方法，通过结构化报告分析NLG系统问题，为开发者提供改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具主要输出数值评分，缺乏对NLG系统具体问题的定性分析，难以指导改进。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 开放式的单实例问题分析；2) 直观累积算法对发现问题进行聚类。

Result: 在12个NLG数据集上的实验表明，该方法能正确识别2/3的实例特定问题，生成的错误类型报告与人工标注相似。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge能有效提供NLG系统的定性改进建议，补充现有定量评估的不足。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

### [2] [PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175)
*Peidong Wang,Jian Xue,Rui Zhao,Junkun Chen,Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种短语词典偏置方法，显著提升语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练数据中短语出现频率低，语音翻译任务中短语的正确翻译具有挑战性。

Method: 使用源语言到目标语言的短语映射对，应用于基于转导器的流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型。

Result: 短语词典偏置方法在流式语音翻译模型中相对短语列表偏置提升21%，在多模态大语言模型中短语召回率相对提升85%。

Conclusion: 短语词典偏置方法有效提升了语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性和召回率。

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

### [3] [A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218)
*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了生成式卷积神经网络在原始音频波形上的词汇不变泛化能力，并提出了一种新方法，通过绕过全连接层输入随机特征图来探测模型的词汇独立泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度神经网络在词汇学习中表现音位规则泛化能力的问题，特别是在全连接层瓶颈缩小的情况下。

Method: 使用生成式卷积神经网络处理原始音频波形，缩小全连接层瓶颈至8个通道，并提出绕过全连接层输入随机特征图的新技术。

Result: 卷积层能够动态泛化超出全连接层学习范围的音位依赖关系，表明其具有词汇独立的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 卷积层在音位规则泛化中表现出独立于词汇约束的动态能力，为深度神经网络的泛化机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

### [4] [Extrapolation by Association: Length Generalization Transfer in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09251)
*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer模型在长度泛化能力上可通过任务间关联实现跨任务迁移，预训练模型能复用计算结构促进下游任务外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何通过任务关联实现从短输入到长输入的泛化能力，以深入理解其泛化机制。

Method: 通过多个算法任务（如算术运算、字符串变换、迷宫导航）验证长度泛化的跨任务迁移，并分析注意力头复用情况。

Result: 模型在相关任务上能继承泛化能力，预训练模型展现出可复用的计算结构，注意力头复用与泛化迁移相关。

Conclusion: 任务间的组合式复用是Transformer泛化能力的关键，为理解其外推机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [5] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型自锚注意力模型（SAAM），用于识别和分类游戏聊天中的亲社会行为，相比现有技术提升7.9%，并在《使命召唤》中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于检测游戏聊天中的负面内容，而亲社会行为的识别同样重要但缺乏相关数据集和模型。

Method: 采用无监督发现与游戏领域专家合作，提出自锚注意力模型（SAAM），利用整个训练集作为“锚点”提升模型性能。

Result: SAAM模型在低资源环境下表现优异，提升7.9%，并开发了首个自动化分类亲社会行为的系统。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了NLP在游戏聊天中的应用，还为平台从单纯惩罚负面行为转向鼓励积极互动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

### [6] [Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277)
*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，通过比较LLM生成的自我自然语言解释（self-NLE）与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量评估其忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖行为测试或计算块识别来评估self-NLE的忠实性，但未考察模型推理的神经活动，导致解释可能不真实。

Method: 引入一种灵活框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，从而定量测量其忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并建立了self-NLE与模型推理之间的直接联系。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了对self-NLE忠实性的理解，并为生成更真实的self-NLE提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

### [7] [$(RSA)^2$: A Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware Rational Speech Act Framework for Figurative Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09301)
*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑修辞策略的RSA框架$(RSA)^2$，用于解释比喻语言，无需建模说话者动机，结合LLM在讽刺解释任务上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RSA框架无法处理比喻语言或需要针对情境建模说话者动机，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 扩展RSA框架为$(RSA)^2$，通过建模说话者的修辞策略而非具体动机来解释非字面表达。

Result: 在新型讽刺数据集PragMega+上，$(RSA)^2$结合LLM实现了最先进的讽刺解释性能。

Conclusion: 修辞策略感知的$(RSA)^2$框架为比喻语言理解提供了更通用的计算建模方法。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

### [8] [Alzheimer's Dementia Detection Using Perplexity from Paired Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09315)
*Yao Xiao,Heidi Christensen,Stefan Goetze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用Mistral-7B大语言模型改进配对困惑度方法，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病（AD）语言能力下降的检测准确率，并展示了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）常伴随语言能力退化，现有检测方法准确率有限且决策过程不透明。本研究旨在通过大语言模型提升检测性能并增强可解释性。

Method: 采用指令微调版Mistral-7B大语言模型，改进配对困惑度方法，并通过提示工程分析模型学到的AD语言模式。

Result: 新方法比现有最佳配对困惑度方法平均准确率提升3.33%，较ADReSS 2020冠军方法提升6.35%，且决策边界清晰可解释。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能有效检测AD语言特征，其可解释性为模型分析和数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [9] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一系列创新方法，包括Lion、WebR、LTE和BMC，以改进大语言模型的对齐问题，并引入FollowBench评估模型遵循复杂指令的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在多种任务中表现出色，但如何高效且有效地使其与人类期望对齐仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 论文提出了多种方法：Lion框架通过对抗蒸馏优化训练数据；WebR从原始网页自动合成指令调优数据；LTE框架通过元学习实现知识高效更新；BMC改进DPO以捕捉标记级相关性。

Result: 这些方法在零样本推理、数据多样性和可扩展性、知识更新效率及对齐效果上均取得显著提升，同时FollowBench评估揭示了当前模型在遵循复杂约束方面的不足。

Conclusion: 论文通过创新方法显著推进了LLM的对齐研究，并提供了未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备心智理论能力，通过多智能体强化学习框架提升AI与人类协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在无明确监督的情况下能推断文本意图，但其是否具备理解他人意图的心智理论能力尚不明确，这对人机协作至关重要。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架，通过自然语言交互训练LLM智能体，模拟人类社交推理以促进协作。

Result: 研究表明，LLM智能体能够通过交互学习协作策略，为构建人机混合协作系统提供了潜在路径。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出初步心智理论能力，未来可推动人机无缝协作，对人工智能交互领域具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

### [11] [RePO: Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09340)
*Siheng Li,Zhanhui Zhou,Wai Lam,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePO通过利用回放策略提升大语言模型的强化学习效率，相比GRPO在计算成本和数据效率上有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO方法在优化大语言模型时存在高计算成本和低数据效率的问题，需要一种更高效的方法来提升性能。

Method: 提出RePO方法，通过回放缓冲区检索离策略样本，利用多样化的样本进行策略优化。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，RePO显著提升了模型性能，同时计算成本仅增加15%，有效优化步骤增加48%。

Conclusion: RePO是一种高效且有效的策略优化方法，能够显著提升大语言模型的性能，同时保持较低的计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository

*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面研究了小型语言模型中的潜在多头注意力（MLA），发现效率与质量之间的权衡。通过实验，MLA+RoPE在减少45% KV缓存内存的同时，验证损失仅增加0.3%，实现了帕累托改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在小型语言模型中应用潜在多头注意力（MLA）的效率和性能表现，特别是在内存受限的部署场景下，寻找更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 方法包括训练30M参数的GPT模型，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA和MLA+RoPE三种架构变体，重点关注KV缓存内存和验证损失的表现。

Result: 结果显示，MLA+RoPE在减少45% KV缓存内存的同时，验证损失仅增加0.3%，且在推理速度上比全秩MLA快1.4倍。GPT-4评估也证实了其高质量表现。

Conclusion: 结论是MLA+RoPE在小型语言模型中表现出色，尤其在内存受限的场景下，是一种高效的注意力机制改进方案。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

Conclusion: DIVE通过多样性增强的专家重建，显著降低训练开销，为高效LLM部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型推动了Text-to-SQL系统的发展，但评估生成SQL的语义等价性仍具挑战性，尤其是面对模糊用户查询和多种有效SQL解释时。

Method: 论文提出使用LLMs评估语义等价性，并分析SQL等价与不等价的常见模式。

Result: 研究揭示了LLM在评估语义等价性时的常见模式及局限性。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的语义等价评估存在挑战，但为Text-to-SQL系统提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
Text-to-SQL (NL2SQL) systems, yet evaluating the semantic equivalence of

multiple valid SQL interpretations. This paper explores using LLMs to assess
both semantic and a more practical "weak" semantic equivalence. We analyze
common patterns of SQL equivalence and inequivalence, discuss challenges in
LLM-based evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出COGENT框架，用于生成符合课程标准的适龄教育内容，通过多维度评估验证其效果优于人工参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育应用中存在与课程标准对齐困难、阅读水平不一致等问题，尤其在STEM教育中平衡科学性与通俗性更具挑战。

Method: COGENT框架整合三大课程要素（科学概念、核心思想、学习目标），通过文本长度、词汇和句式控制可读性，并采用“好奇驱动”方法提升学生兴趣。

Result: 实验表明COGENT生成的文本在适龄性上优于或持平人工编写内容，多维度评估（LLM评判+专家分析）验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为规模化生产自适应学习资源提供了可行方案，实现了质量与适应性的平衡。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

TL;DR: RuleReasoner方法通过强化学习和动态采样提升小推理模型在多样任务中的规则推理能力，显著优于大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中规则格式、类型和复杂性的多样性对规则推理提出了挑战，研究小推理模型是否能有效学习并泛化至不同任务和领域。

Method: 提出RuleReasoner方法，通过强化学习和领域感知动态采样策略，动态调整不同领域的采样权重以增强模型泛化能力。

Result: RuleReasoner在分布内和分布外任务上显著优于前沿模型，计算效率也更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner证明了小推理模型通过强化学习和动态采样能有效提升规则推理能力，具有高效和泛化优势。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

TL;DR: CoLMbo模型通过结合说话人编码器和提示条件，生成详细的说话人描述，解决了传统说话人识别系统在捕捉人口统计属性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅能进行分类任务，无法详细描述说话人的特征（如方言、性别、年龄等），限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出CoLMbo模型，集成说话人编码器和基于提示的条件生成，动态适应用户定义的说话人特征，生成定制化描述。

Result: CoLMbo在多样化数据集上表现出色，尤其在零样本场景中显著提升了说话人描述的准确性和丰富性。

Conclusion: CoLMbo为说话人识别领域带来重要进展，能够生成结构化、上下文丰富的说话人特征描述。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习模型自动区分高低质量新闻标题/链接，传统集成方法和深度学习模型均表现良好，但存在性能与训练时间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻的泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，研究旨在自动区分高低质量内容。

Method: 使用包含57,544,214条新闻链接/标题的平衡数据集，提取115个语言特征，评估12种机器学习模型，包括传统集成方法和微调DistilBERT。

Result: 传统集成方法（如bagging分类器）表现强劲（88.1%准确率），微调DistilBERT准确率最高（90.3%），但训练时间更长。

Conclusion: NLP特征结合传统分类器或深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，需在预测性能和训练时间之间权衡。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能像人类一样根据上下文灵活使用礼貌策略，平衡信息传递和社交目标。

Method: 通过约束性和开放性生成任务，比较人类和LLM的回应，并进行语言分析。

Result: 大模型（≥70B参数）能复现计算语用学中的关键偏好，但过度使用负面礼貌策略，在积极情境中可能引发误解。

Conclusion: LLM在礼貌策略上表现优异，但细微差异引发了对AI系统语用对齐的思考。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪方法在数据稀缺和需要在线更新的课堂环境中表现不佳，需利用知识概念的层次结构提供先验信息。

Method: 基于隐马尔可夫树模型，通过EM算法估计学生掌握程度，并支持增量更新机制。

Result: 实验表明KT$^2$在低资源在线场景中 consistently 优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过结构化知识层次有效解决了低资源知识追踪问题。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多项选择题上表现优异，但对输入扰动高度敏感，需提升其在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TCD算法，通过强制token级预测对齐增强推理稳定性，并结合提示工程优化。

Result: 在CommonsenseQA等基准测试中，TCD使弱模型性能提升高达39%，且能隐式正则化过度自信输出。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用、模型无关的方法，可提升LLM在现实缺陷下的推理稳定性，推动其在关键安全或用户应用中的可靠部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的KGQA方法受限于标注数据稀缺性和多跳推理样本不足，传统数据增强方法易导致语义失真且忽视多跳推理，亟需一种能同时保证语义准确性和多样性的增强方法。

Method: 采用提示工程引导LLM生成(问题,逻辑形式)对：1)生成单跳伪问题对齐KG关系；2)语义保留式问题重构；3)答案引导的反向路径探索生成多跳问题，形成增强-生成-检索的语义解析流程。

Result: 在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上F1、Hits@1和准确率分别提升2.8%/1.2%/3.1%和1.8%/1.1%/2.4%，超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过多策略数据增强有效解决了语义对齐与多跳推理的平衡问题，为KGQA任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 在数字化时代，欺骗行为检测既关键又具挑战性。研究旨在全面评估LLMs和LMMs在不同领域的欺骗检测能力，为实际应用提供参考。

Method: 研究使用三个数据集（RLTD、MU3D、OpSpam），评估开源和商业LLMs的性能，分析零样本和少样本方法，并探讨辅助特征（如非语言手势）和提示策略的影响。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在文本欺骗检测任务中达到最先进水平，而LMMs在多模态线索利用上表现不佳。不同提示策略对检测效果有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在欺骗检测中具有潜力，但LMMs需进一步优化以充分利用多模态信息。研究为实际应用提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调（SFT）虽增强大模型的指令遵循和领域适应能力，但会削弱其通用能力，且因无法访问原始预训练数据，第三方实施SFT时灾难性遗忘问题加剧。

Method: 先重建基础模型的SFT指令分布，再通过多模型筛选最优数据，与新数据混合后进行SFT。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持通用领域能力的同时，提升了特定任务的性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效降低了灾难性遗忘风险，无需原始SFT数据，更具成本效益。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接对齐算法（DAAs）存在奖励-生成差距，即训练目标与推理生成表现不匹配，影响模型对齐效果。

Method: 提出Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training (POET)，通过截断偏好与非偏好响应至等长，优化DAAs目标。

Result: 实验显示POET在DPO和SimPO上表现提升，AlpacaEval 2得分最高提升15.6，下游任务普遍改进。

Conclusion: POET有效解决了DAAs中奖励优化与生成表现的错位问题，提升了模型对齐效果。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

Method: 采用三种互补方法：自下而上的计算模型（基于LLM的主题建模）、混合方法（专家审查计算模型结果）和自上而下的专家驱动方法（心理评估自杀未遂叙述）。

Result: 自下而上方法识别出5个与自杀未遂相关的主题，其中2个（心理健康挣扎和YouTube参与度）在时间上有显著变化；专家未识别出平台特有的YouTube参与度指标；心理评估显示，自杀未遂者上传视频的动机差异显著（帮助他人 vs. 个人康复）。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种方法，研究提供了对自杀行为的细致理解，连接了数字行为与临床见解，突出了自下而上方法在发现平台特有指标中的价值。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLM）性能的可复现性受硬件配置和数值精度影响显著，提出轻量级推理框架LayerCast以平衡内存效率与数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的性能评估依赖于基准测试的准确性和可复现性，但研究发现硬件配置和数值精度的微小变化会导致显著的输出差异，尤其是在推理模型中。

Method: 通过在不同硬件、软件和精度设置下进行控制实验，量化模型输出的差异，并提出LayerCast框架，在16位精度存储权重的同时使用FP32进行计算。

Result: 实验显示，GPU数量、类型和评估批次大小的差异可导致推理模型准确率变化高达9%，响应长度差异达9000个token。LayerCast有效平衡了内存效率和数值稳定性。

Conclusion: 数值精度对LLM推理的可复现性至关重要，但常被忽视。LayerCast提供了一种兼顾效率和稳定性的解决方案，为未来评估实践提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at
https://github.com/nanomaoli/llm_reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一旋转位置编码方法，结合Transformer和SSM优势，提升长序列建模效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在位置编码机制上存在不兼容性，导致混合模型性能不佳，需统一编码方法。

Method: 提出统一旋转位置嵌入（RoPE）方法，构建混合架构\model，整合Transformer和SSM层。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，\model训练和推理速度分别提升42.3%和29.5%，语言建模准确率提高4%以上。

Conclusion: 统一位置编码解决了混合模型的位置不兼容问题，实现了高效、高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Method: 构建370k高质量医学推理数据集ReasonMed，采用多智能体验证和错误修正流程优化推理路径，结合详细思维链和简洁答案摘要进行微调。

Result: ReasonMed-7B在sub-10B模型中表现最佳，比之前最优模型提升4.17%，在PubMedQA上超过LLaMA3.1-70B达4.60%。

Conclusion: ReasonMed数据集和训练策略有效提升医学推理能力，为医学问答任务设定了新基准。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常依赖单一知识源（非结构化文本或结构化知识），且缺乏认知启发的知识激活机制，导致检索和生成效果受限。

Method: 提出KG-Infused RAG框架，将知识图谱融入RAG系统，实现扩散激活机制，通过检索KG事实扩展查询，并结合语料片段与结构化知识增强生成。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG性能比传统RAG提升3.8%至13.8%，且作为插件集成到Self-RAG时进一步带来性能增益。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种即插即用的增强模块，能有效提升基于语料的RAG方法的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）因情感主观性和自然场景下数据分布不均而具有挑战性，需解决类别不平衡和情感模糊问题。

Method: 提出MEDUSA框架：1) 前两阶段训练基于DeepSER（跨模态Transformer融合）的分类器集合；2) 后两阶段优化元分类器，结合标注分数、平衡采样和多任务学习。

Result: MEDUSA在Interspeech 2025自然场景语音情感识别挑战赛的类别情感识别任务中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEDUSA通过多模态融合和分阶段训练有效提升自然场景下的SER性能，为复杂情感识别提供新方案。

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively
handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an
ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human
annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and
multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic
Conditions Challenge.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Google Translate和DeepL在英语到希腊语翻译中的性别偏见问题，发现两者在性别明确时表现良好，但在性别不明确时难以实现包容性翻译。GPT-4o在提供性别中立替代方案方面展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引起关注。本研究旨在评估商业MT系统在英语到希腊语翻译中的性别偏见。

Method: 研究使用手动构建的双语数据集GendEL，包含240个性别明确和模糊的句子，涵盖刻板职业名词和形容词，评估Google Translate、DeepL和GPT-4o的表现。

Result: 发现两种MT系统在性别明确时表现良好，DeepL在女性性别明确句子中表现最佳，但在性别不明确时难以实现包容性翻译。GPT-4o能生成合适的性别中立替代方案，但仍存在残余偏见。

Conclusion: 商业MT系统在性别包容性翻译方面仍有不足，GPT-4o展现出改进潜力，但需进一步减少残余偏见以实现更公平的翻译。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球技术普及需要新工具支持，但LLM在低资源语言（如马其顿语）上的能力有限，限制了相关国家的应用。

Method: 收集40GB马其顿语文本（3.5B词）构建最大语料库；创建10.6万条文化相关的指令数据集；设计包含7个基准的评估套件；训练8B参数模型domestic-yak。

Result: domestic-yak在8B参数模型中全面领先，性能媲美10倍规模模型；母语者评价其语法正确性和文化适应性优于更大模型。

Conclusion: 公开的语料、模型和评估工具为低资源语言LLM研究奠定基础，促进技术普惠。

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在训练中无意记忆数据的问题，尤其是隐私和知识产权泄露的潜在风险。

Method: 通过研究序列的内在维度（ID）作为潜在空间结构复杂性的几何代理，分析其对记忆行为的调节作用。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更不易被记忆，特别是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露情况下。

Conclusion: 记忆行为受模型规模、暴露程度和序列复杂性共同影响，ID可作为抑制记忆的信号。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）虽然廉价且强大，但在标注文本时与专家标注存在不一致性，这种偏差影响下游任务（如回归系数和因果效应估计）。现有去偏方法（如DSL和PPI）在理论上有效，但在实际有限样本中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 研究比较了两种去偏方法（DSL和PPI）在不同专家标注数量下的性能，分析了LLM偏差和有限专家标注对结果的影响，并在多个任务上进行了实验对比。

Result: DSL在偏差减少和实证效率上通常优于PPI，但其表现因数据集而异；PPI在大数据集上表现稳定，但效率较低。两种方法在有限样本中存在偏差-方差权衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明去偏方法在有限样本中的效率需要进一步量化，未来研究应开发更多指标来评估其性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Conclusion: 研究表明，建模声学缩减时需结合频率、上下文预测性及平均上下文预测性，并整合信息论指标与判别学习的信息。

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下构建更鲁棒、准确的手语翻译系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: RAPL通过结构化检索与推理协同优化，为知识增强的LLM提供了高效可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

Answering (QA) over tabular data. Our approach integrates several key
components: text-to-SQL and text-to-code generation modules, a self-correction
mechanism, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, it
includes an end-to-end (E2E) module, all orchestrated by a large language model

### [44] [Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09669)
*Lihu Chen,Gaël Varoquaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过查询级别不确定性检测大语言模型知识边界的方法，无需生成文本即可判断模型能否回答问题，并展示其在RAG和模型级联中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让大语言模型具备识别知识边界的能力，以实现自适应推理（如调用RAG、深度思考或弃权机制），从而提升AI的效率和可信度。

Method: 提出无需训练的'内部置信度'方法，利用跨层和跨token的自评估来检测知识边界。

Result: 在事实问答和数学推理任务上，内部置信度优于基线方法，并能有效降低推理成本同时保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别知识边界，为高效RAG和模型级联提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

*Hao Xiong,Chuanyuan Tan,Wenliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文针对非结构化知识编辑（UKE）中的局部性评估缺失和微调方法异常失败问题，构建了新数据集并提出优化微调方法FT-UKE，显著超越现有SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前非结构化知识编辑（UKE）研究缺乏局部性评估，且微调方法存在异常失败问题，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 扩展两个UKE数据集构建UnKEBench-Loc和AKEW-Loc，分析影响微调性能的四个因素，提出优化方法FT-UKE。

Result: FT-UKE在单次和批量编辑中均优于SOTA，批量编辑时优势随规模增大（指标领先从+6.78%提升至+10.80%）。

Conclusion: FT-UKE通过系统优化成为UKE任务的新强基准，其可扩展性为未来研究提供实用训练方案。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于概率框架的LLM不确定性量化方法，通过引入逆模型和遗传算法扰动策略，定义新指标Inv-Entropy和TSU，显著优于现有语义UQ方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的不确定性量化方法缺乏概率理论基础且多为启发式，需建立系统化框架以提升可靠性。

Method: 构建双随机游走马尔可夫链模型，基于语义相似度定义转移概率；提出逆模型概率框架及遗传算法扰动策略GAAP。

Result: 实验表明Inv-Entropy超越现有语义UQ方法，TSU指标可直接评估不确定性而无需依赖正确性代理。

Conclusion: 该概率框架具有高度灵活性，为LLM不确定性量化提供了理论支撑和实用工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code
to reproduce the results can be found at

*Zhenran Xu,Yiyu Wang,Xue Yang,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComfyUI-R1是一个用于自动生成AI工作流的大型推理模型，通过两阶段训练框架显著提升了工作流生成的准确率，超越了现有领先闭源方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容的工作流定制需要高度专业知识，存在学习曲线陡峭的问题。为解决这一挑战，研究团队开发了ComfyUI-R1，旨在自动化工作流生成，降低用户门槛。

Method: 研究采用两阶段训练框架：1) 通过链式思维（CoT）微调进行冷启动，使模型适应ComfyUI领域；2) 通过强化学习提升推理能力，使用细粒度规则-指标混合奖励确保格式有效性、结构完整性和节点级保真度。

Result: 实验表明，7B参数的ComfyUI-R1模型实现了97%的格式有效性，并在通过率、节点级和图级F1分数上显著超越GPT-4o和Claude系列等领先闭源模型。

Conclusion: ComfyUI-R1展示了长链式思维推理在AI艺术创作中的潜力，特别是在合成具有多样化节点的复杂工作流方面表现突出。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

### [48] [Do LLMs Give Psychometrically Plausible Responses in Educational Assessments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09796)
*Andreas Säuberli,Diego Frassinelli,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了18种指令调优大语言模型在阅读、美国历史和经济学选择题上的反应，发现大模型虽能通过温度校准更接近人类反应，但零样本设置下仍不适合直接用于教育测试开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否能模拟人类在测试中的反应行为，以加速教育测试开发，减少对真人预测试的依赖。

Method: 使用心理测量学中的经典测试理论和项目反应理论框架，分析18个模型在两个公开多选题数据集（涉及阅读、美国历史和经济学）上的反应分布。

Result: 大模型表现出过度自信，但经温度校准后反应分布更接近人类；模型在阅读理解题上与人类相关性较高，但整体相关性不强。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在零样本设置下无法可靠替代人类预测试参与者，需进一步研究提升其心理测量合理性。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CoRT框架，通过Hint-Engineering优化大模型与代码解释器的交互，提升数学推理能力并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂数学运算上效率低或准确性不足，直接结合代码解释器（CI）效果不佳，需优化交互方式。

Method: 使用Hint-Engineering合成代码增强的推理数据，结合监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习对模型进行后训练。

Result: 在五个数学推理数据集上，32B和1.5B模型分别提升4%和8%准确率，并减少30%-50%的token消耗。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效提升LRMs与CI的协作效率，显著改善数学推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出EmoNet-Voice，一个包含大规模预训练数据集和专家标注基准的新资源，用于评估语音情感识别模型在40种细粒度情感上的表现，并通过合成音频和心理学专家验证解决了现有数据集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音情感识别数据集在情感粒度、隐私问题或依赖表演数据方面存在局限，需要更强大的基准来评估AI系统的情感理解能力。

Method: 构建EmoNet-Voice，包括大规模预训练数据集（EmoNet-Voice Big）和专家标注基准（EmoNet-Voice Bench），利用先进语音生成技术合成情感音频，并由心理学专家验证。

Result: 提出的Empathic Insight Voice模型在语音情感识别上达到新标准，与人类专家高度一致，且高唤醒情绪（如愤怒）比低唤醒状态（如专注）更易检测。

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice为语音情感识别提供了更全面、隐私保护的评估资源，推动了AI情感理解能力的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Motivation: 现有康复评估系统存在数据不平衡和难以检测细微运动错误的问题，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 使用Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA)生成合成骨骼数据，并结合注意力图卷积网络进行训练。

Result: 实验显示，平均绝对误差降低27.6%，错误分类准确率提升45.8%，模型能聚焦临床关键关节和运动阶段。

Conclusion: EGPA在临床和家庭康复场景中提升了运动质量评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

TL;DR: 论文提出新闻媒体来源数据集，针对图像与文本背景不匹配的检测问题，测试了六种大语言模型在位置和时间相关性任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前媒体操纵的主要形式是图像与文本背景不匹配，现有方法仅关注语义匹配，忽略了图像来源的时空背景。

Method: 构建新闻媒体来源数据集，提出位置来源相关性（LOR）和时间来源相关性（DTOR）任务，并在六种大语言模型上进行基线测试。

Result: 零样本在LOR任务表现良好，但DTOR任务表现不佳，显示需要进一步优化架构。

Conclusion: 现有方法在检测图像时空背景匹配上存在不足，未来需开发专用架构提升性能。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个因果框架，通过充分性和必要性分析改进CoT推理，实现自动增删推理步骤，提升效率并减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT推理面临两个核心挑战：推理步骤的充分性（是否全面支持结论）和必要性（是否不可或缺）。

Method: 采用因果概率框架量化推理步骤的影响，自动识别冗余或缺失步骤并进行增删。

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中显著提升效率，减少token消耗且不降低准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为提升LLM推理性能和成本效益提供了可行方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识或辅助模型，难以有效检测大语言模型产生的幻觉。研究发现幻觉回答与提示的隐藏状态分布差异更小，这为模型内检测提供了新思路。

Method: 利用提示与响应隐藏状态分布的概率差异作为幻觉分数，采用可学习的深度核函数自动捕捉分布间的细微几何差异。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有基线，即使不进行核训练也能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种鲁棒、可扩展的幻觉检测方案，揭示了幻觉产生于表面改写而非实质推理的特性。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Motivation: 尽管初步研究表明LLMs在处理非英语提示时隐藏激活类似英语，但近期多语言性能的显著提升挑战了LLMs“用英语思考”的假设。本文旨在探索LLMs在多语言处理中的内部机制。

Method: 通过识别语言相关神经元（共享神经元和专属神经元），分析其在模型发展中的变化，并提出针对不同发展阶段的语言无关神经元训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，随着LLMs的发展，共享神经元的比例和功能重要性显著增加，而专属神经元的影响逐渐减弱，形成支持抽象思维的语言无关核心参数空间。

Conclusion: LLMs在多语言处理中逐渐形成语言无关的核心参数空间，支持抽象思维，神经元特定训练策略在不同发展阶段具有潜力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出VerIF方法，结合规则和LLM验证增强指令跟随的强化学习，构建VerInstruct数据集，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令跟随的强化学习中验证工程的最佳实践尚未充分探索，需解决验证挑战。

Method: 提出VerIF方法，结合规则代码验证和基于大型推理模型（如QwQ-32B）的LLM验证，并构建22k条VerInstruct数据集。

Result: 训练模型在多个指令跟随基准测试中显著提升，达到同类模型最佳性能，且不影响通用能力。

Conclusion: VerIF可整合到现有强化学习流程中提升模型性能，已开源数据、代码和模型。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

*Wuwei Zhang,Fangcong Yin,Howard Yen,Danqi Chen,Xi Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的注意力头QRHEAD和检索器QR-RETRIEVER，用于增强长上下文语言模型中的信息检索能力，并在多个任务中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现了在长上下文语言模型中负责检索关键信息的注意力头（retrieval heads），但如何进一步提升其检索效率和效果仍是一个挑战。

Method: 通过聚合输入查询的注意力分数，识别出QRHEAD，并开发了QR-RETRIEVER检索器，利用QRHEAD的注意力质量作为检索分数，选择最相关的上下文部分进行推理。

Result: 在LongMemEval和CLIPPER等多跳推理任务中，性能提升超过10%，并在BEIR基准测试中作为重新排序器表现出色，优于其他基于LLM的重新排序器如RankGPT。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个通用的检索器，还增强了对长上下文语言模型能力的可解释性理解，证明了查询-上下文注意力评分和任务选择对识别高效QRHEAD的重要性。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

TL;DR: Resa模型通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）高效提取语言模型的推理能力，成本极低且性能接近RL训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地从语言模型中提取和增强推理能力，避免昂贵且耗时的强化学习（RL）训练。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型捕获推理能力，并通过监督微调将其迁移至目标模型，无需推理轨迹数据。

Result: SAE-Tuning在仅1美元成本和20分钟内达到RL训练模型97%的性能，并在轻量RL训练模型上显著提升推理表现。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning是一种高效、低成本且可泛化、模块化的方法，显著提升语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了社交媒体上AI生成文本检测的挑战，指出在攻击者不公开微调模型的情况下，检测效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的AI生成文本检测因文本短、语言非正式而困难，但这对防止在线影响力活动中的滥用至关重要。

Method: 研究通过开源、闭源及微调的大语言模型生成505,159条社交媒体帖子，覆盖11个争议话题，模拟威胁行为者的操作。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，AI生成文本的检测率大幅下降，人类研究也证实了这一结果。

Conclusion: 微调的大语言模型对现有检测算法构成显著挑战，这一发现对所有检测领域均有广泛影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上达到最先进准确率，且多语言微调提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤在大语言模型解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线有毒语言在缺乏内容审核工具的地区造成实际危害，尤其是在标记数据有限的塞尔维亚语、克罗地亚语和波斯尼亚语中。

Method: 构建并手动标记了4500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型（GPT-3.5 Turbo、GPT-4.1、Gemini 1.5 Pro和Claude 3 Opus）在零样本和上下文增强模式下的表现。

Result: 添加上下文片段平均提高召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10。Gemini在上下文增强模式下表现最佳，F1分数和准确率均为0.82。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计和阈值校准，可以在低资源语言环境中有效提升有毒语言检测效果。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种支持部分检测的数据与模型解决方案，通过构建细粒度标注数据集FineHarm和提出流式内容监控器（SCM），显著提高了有害内容检测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）安全防护主要依赖完整输出的全检测，导致高延迟；而部分检测方法因训练与推理的差距性能不佳。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集（29K细粒度标注的提示-响应对），并提出流式内容监控器（SCM），通过响应和令牌级双重监督实现实时有害性判断。

Result: SCM仅需观察响应前18%的令牌即可达到与全检测相当的宏F1分数（0.95+），并能作为伪有害性标注器提升安全对齐效果。

Conclusion: SCM在部分检测中高效且准确，同时能增强LLM的安全对齐，为实际部署提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AIM的自适应干预机制，通过代理Q函数减少人类监督的认知负担，显著降低专家监控成本并提高学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式模仿学习（IIL）方法对人类监督者的认知要求较高，需要一种更高效的方法来减少专家干预的需求。

Method: AIM利用代理Q函数模拟人类干预规则，根据代理与专家动作的对齐程度动态调整干预请求，从而优化学习过程。

Result: 与基于不确定性的基线方法Thrifty-DAgger相比，AIM在人类接管成本和学习效率上提升了40%，并能有效识别安全关键状态。

Conclusion: AIM通过自适应干预机制显著减少了专家数据需求和环境交互次数，同时提高了专家演示的质量。

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired
behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high
cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention
Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive
criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function
to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on
the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when
the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent
becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the
real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our
expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert
monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to
the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%
improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert
assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and
reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo
video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳Shojaee等人(2025)关于大推理模型(LRMs)在规划谜题上存在'准确性崩溃'的结论，指出其研究存在实验设计问题。

Method: 通过分析实验设计的三个关键问题：(1)输出令牌限制被突破；(2)评估框架无法区分推理失败与实际约束；(3)包含数学上无解的测试案例。改进方法要求生成函数而非完整步骤列表。

Result: 初步实验表明，在控制实验设计因素后，多个模型在曾被报告完全失败的河内塔案例上表现出高准确率。

Conclusion: 评估AI推理能力时需要更严谨的实验设计，现有'准确性崩溃'结论主要反映实验局限而非模型能力缺陷。

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit
"accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds.
We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design
limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals
three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed
model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly
acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated
evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and
practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3)
Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically
impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models
are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we
control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions
instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple
models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported
as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful
experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 旨在开发一个统一的多模态模型，能够高效处理多种输入模态并支持生成任务，避免使用多个独立模型或复杂调整。

Conclusion: Ming-Omni为多模态研究提供了强大且灵活的解决方案，代码和模型权重已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

Method: 通过将大语言模型置于与人类相同的实验条件下，比较它们在‘石头剪刀布’和‘囚徒困境’中的行为表现。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型仅能部分模拟人类的有限理性，需改进训练方法以增强对手建模和情境感知能力。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making
settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full
rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental
paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on
two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's
Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational
play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,
we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality
characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human
heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation
when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly
and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game
environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures
in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find
effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that
current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and
highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent
modeling and stronger context awareness.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

Motivation: MCTD虽在复杂规划任务中表现优异，但其树搜索的序列特性和迭代去噪导致计算开销大，限制了效率和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Fast-MCTD，结合并行MCTD（延迟树更新和冗余感知选择）和稀疏MCTD（轨迹粗化缩短展开长度）两种技术。

Result: 实验显示Fast-MCTD比标准MCTD提速100倍，且保持或提升规划性能，甚至在某些任务中推理速度超过Diffuser。

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD成为扩散模型推理时规划的实用、高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Conclusion: 微调LLM能高效解决《外交》等复杂策略游戏的决策问题，为AI在类似场景中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and
competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods
rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which
demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong
performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to
Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action
combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address
this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns
equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive
factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action
assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium
policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model
using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,
surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the
Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single
agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making
and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to
increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant
attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an
agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal
norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific
application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large
models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value
principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment
evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a
top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system
application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific
viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets
for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods.
Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within
agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in
this field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Intent Factored Generation (IFG)方法，通过两阶段采样（首先生成多样化意图，再基于意图生成连贯回答）提升大语言模型输出的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在提升多样性时仅停留在词汇层面，导致推理任务探索不足和对话重复。需要一种能同时保证多样性和输出质量的方法。

Method: IFG将采样分为两阶段：1) 用高温采样语义密集的意图（如摘要/关键词）；2) 用低温结合原始提示和意图生成最终回答。在思维链任务中显式提示模型声明每步目标。

Result: 在数学/代码任务中提升pass@k和RL验证反馈性能；指令微调时结合DPO保持奖励的同时增加对话多样性；在通用语言建模任务中实现更高多样性且不降低质量。

Conclusion: IFG通过简单修改提示和温度调节，即可在不损失性能的前提下显著提升LLM样本多样性，适用于多种算法和应用场景。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

Motivation: 研究人类如何在新信息下修正信念，以开发能更好模拟和与人类推理对齐的AI系统。

Result: 人类偏好基于解释的信念修正，即使这些修正可能不符合经典理论中的最小修正原则。

Conclusion: AI系统需支持基于解释的信念修正，以更好地与人类认知过程对齐。

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合互联网视频和少量机器人交互数据的自监督学习方法V-JEPA 2，在视频理解、预测和机器人规划任务中取得先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI面临的主要挑战是通过观察学习理解和行动。本文探索如何利用互联网规模的视频数据和少量交互数据，构建能理解、预测和规划物理世界的模型。

Method: 首先在超100万小时互联网视频上预训练无动作联合嵌入预测架构V-JEPA 2；随后与大型语言模型对齐；最后用不到62小时的未标注机器人视频微调动作条件世界模型V-JEPA 2-AC。

Result: V-JEPA 2在动作理解（Something-Something v2 77.3%准确率）和动作预测（Epic-Kitchens-100 39.7召回率）达到SOTA；结合语言模型后在视频QA任务（如PerceptionTest 84.0分）表现优异；V-JEPA 2-AC在零样本条件下实现机器人抓取任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过自监督学习和少量交互数据，可以从网络规模数据中训练出能在物理世界中进行规划的世界模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

Motivation: 现有小型多模态模型在上下文学习(ICL)中表现不稳定，且性能不随样本增加而单调提升，推测是由于图像嵌入中的冗余信息干扰导致。

Method: 提出基于元学习的软提示蒸馏方法：1) 设计可集成到LLaVA架构中的注意力映射模块 2) 联合学习任务相关的软提示 3) 仅需少量梯度步即可实现任务适应。

Conclusion: 通过元学习提取任务相关的软提示，能有效提升多模态模型在少样本场景下的任务适应能力，为资源受限环境提供解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

Motivation: 传统抗体亲和力测量方法耗时且昂贵，AI技术的发展为抗体设计和亲和力预测提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源Llama 3框架和OAS数据库的抗体序列数据，构建了抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测模型。

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity模型显著提升了抗体-抗原亲和力预测的准确性和效率，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在金融决策中难以捕捉人类行为模式（如信息不对称下的专家依赖、损失厌恶等），需改进以适应动态金融环境。

Method: 提出FinHEAR多智能体框架，整合专家引导检索、信心调整头寸管理和结果反馈机制，基于事件驱动流程分析历史数据与实时事件。

Conclusion: FinHEAR通过行为经济学指导的模块化设计，显著提升了语言模型在复杂金融决策中的适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

TL;DR: 论文提出PageLLM方法，通过用户反馈和混合粒度奖励机制优化大语言模型在整页优化任务中的表现，显著提升用户体验和商业指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整页优化（WPO）对提升搜索和推荐结果展示至关重要，但传统基于人工标注数据的微调方法成本高昂且难以扩展。用户反馈虽易获取但噪声较大，需要有效利用。

Method: 提出PageLLM方法：1) 使用用户反馈作为监督信号；2) 设计混合粒度奖励机制（页面级奖励评估整体质量，项目级奖励关注关键推荐准确性）。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上验证有效，在线A/B测试（超1000万用户）实现GMV提升0.44%。

Conclusion: PageLLM通过创新奖励机制成功解决了用户反馈噪声问题，为LLM在WPO任务中的实用化提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

Conclusion: 团队策略有效融合LLM与ML优势，实现稳定、高效的特征转换，为生成式AI应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

Conclusion: 该研究为将生物相关的神经机制整合到认知模型中迈出了重要一步，深化了对神经活动与行为之间关系的理解。

Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence.
In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of
evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson
processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used
to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism
and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the
categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we
propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for
decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons
activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a
coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing
that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and
that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we
show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes
network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we
designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This
work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant
neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of
the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous
AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application
across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based
model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection,
and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates
adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce
synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or
improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve
communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each
domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead,
convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data
and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical
results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and
communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with
convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts
summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the
adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are
provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency
and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of
the approach.

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the
coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for
the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes
important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the
Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the
coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve
the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of
Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to
the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling
for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is
derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The
novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its
associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is
the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring
that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2
or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the
CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

TL;DR: 提出LwPTV方法，通过层间剪枝任务向量提升多任务学习在域外数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多任务学习模型融合方法主要关注域内数据性能，忽视了域外数据的有效性。

Method: 构建显著性分数衡量任务向量参数冗余度，生成掩码向量进行层间剪枝，保留预训练模型参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升域外任务性能，同时保持域内任务能力。

Conclusion: LwPTV灵活兼容现有模型融合方法，有效扩展多任务学习应用场景。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

TL;DR: 提出利用生成概率增强奖励模型对响应轨迹的细粒度学习，通过一致性正则化提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型依赖粗粒度的响应级评分，难以识别与评分真正相关的响应组件，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 利用生成概率建立响应轨迹内的一致性奖励，通过贝叶斯框架下的正则化方法优化奖励模型。

Result: 改进的奖励模型在RewardBench上表现更优，且能提升DPO对齐策略和BON推理验证效果。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度奖励一致性学习，显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

*Joshua Barron,Devin White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型在记忆与泛化能力之间存在权衡：小模型泛化好但记忆差，大模型记忆强但泛化弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型中记忆与泛化能力的关系，理解模型容量如何影响学习行为。

Method: 通过预训练不同容量的Transformer模型，在两种合成字符任务（算术外推和事实回忆）上测试记忆与泛化能力。

Result: 小模型能外推算术但无法记忆事实，大模型反之；中等容量模型也偏向记忆。联合训练时，所有模型均无法外推。

Conclusion: 预训练可能固有地偏向一种学习模式，模型容量显著影响记忆与泛化的平衡。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异大，缺乏统一评估标准。论文旨在建立一种与LLM无关、非参数化且可解释的评估框架。

Method: 基于1T token构建N-gram语言模型作为威胁模型，将主流越狱攻击适配到该框架进行标准化评测。

Result: 发现安全调优模型的真实攻击成功率低于预期，离散优化攻击显著优于LLM基攻击，有效攻击依赖罕见/特定领域bigram。

Conclusion: 该威胁模型提供了可解释的越狱攻击分析框架，揭示了攻击模式特征，为防御策略设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Method: 提出了特征偏移定位网络（FSL-Net），通过训练学习数据集的统计特性，能够快速定位新数据集中的特征偏移。

Result: FSL-Net能够高效且准确地定位高维数据集中的特征偏移，适用于未见过的数据集和偏移情况。

Conclusion: FSL-Net为解决高维数据特征偏移定位问题提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The
code and ready-to-use trained model are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UPQ的新型渐进量化框架，首次将指令调优的LLM量化至2位，无需依赖专有数据，在MMLU和IFEval基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的迅速增长，在资源受限设备上部署面临挑战，现有2位量化研究仅限于预训练模型，尚未扩展到指令调优模型。

Method: UPQ框架结合块级后训练量化(PTQ)和基于蒸馏的量化感知训练(Distill-QAT)，采用FP16→INT4→INT2渐进量化策略，通过最小化Jensen-Shannon散度保持模型输出一致性。

Result: 首次实现开源指令调优LLM的2位量化，在MMLU和IFEval基准测试中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: UPQ框架成功解决了指令调优LLM的极低位量化难题，为资源受限设备部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

*Javier Lopez-Piqueres,Pranav Deshpande,Archan Ray,Mattia J. Villani,Marco Pistoia,Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaTT提出了一种基于Tensor Train的统一适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调，相比LoRA等方法，参数更少且性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LoRA独立微调每个权重矩阵，导致参数冗余。MetaTT旨在通过共享Tensor Train结构，实现更高效的参数压缩和跨任务适配。

Method: 使用单一共享的Tensor Train分解所有Transformer子模块（如注意力头、前馈层），通过索引结构轴（层、矩阵类型等）实现参数共享，并支持动态扩展任务模式。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，MetaTT在保持与LoRA相近精度的同时，参数显著减少，且优于其他基于张量分解的方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT通过Tensor Train的成熟优化和灵活扩展性，提供了一种高效、可扩展的预训练模型微调方案。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Conclusion: SensorLM在传感器数据理解和自然语言处理方面表现出色，展示了扩展性、标签效率、传感器标题生成和对未见任务的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上的实验表明，CodeBrain通过线性探测展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CodeBrain为EEG建模提供了生物信息学和可解释性基础，未来将发布代码和预训练权重。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity
and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel
configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability
of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models
(EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited
heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale
brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an
efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two
stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes
heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion
of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of
interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the
EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a
sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local
dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects
the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent
multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning
objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive
experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of
CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and
interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future
neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in
the future version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据在多个领域普遍存在，但现有检索方法缺乏语义基础，难以处理异构模态和多通道信号，亟需一种通用解决方案。

Method: TRACE通过文本上下文对齐时间序列嵌入，支持细粒度通道级对齐和跨模态检索，并采用硬负样本挖掘优化语义检索。

Result: TRACE在下游预测和分类任务中达到SOTA性能，同时作为通用检索器增强了时间序列模型的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: TRACE兼具检索器和编码器的双重优势，显著提升了时间序列数据的语义检索和下游任务表现。

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

Conclusion: BSA-TNP证明精度与可扩展性无需妥协，特别适用于平移不变性过程，为复杂应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to
directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes.
While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to
Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry
applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These
applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these
models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly
when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a
versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural
Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks),
group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention
(BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models
while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation
invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3)
transparently model processes that evolve in both space and time, (4) support
high dimensional fixed effects, and (5) scale gracefully -- running inference
with over 1M test points with 100K context points in under a minute on a single
24GB GPU.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Result: 在临床诊断模拟中，CuriosiTree能高效整合异构信息源，其行动选择策略的准确性优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CuriosiTree为LLM中的信息获取提供了一种成本敏感的解决方案，验证了其在复杂决策中的有效性。

Abstract: Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident
decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to
acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by
consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly,
different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing
the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and
cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based,
test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models
(LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected
information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a
balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical
validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables
cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and
outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences
that enable accurate diagnosis.

TL;DR: 提出FNF主干和DBD架构，解决多变量长期时间序列预测中时空建模的挑战，无需辅助技术即实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多借用NLP/CV领域的通用主干（如Transformer），无法充分处理时间序列特性（如周期性），缺乏专为时间序列设计的归纳偏置。

Method: 引入FNF主干统一局部时域和全局频域信息处理，DBD架构通过信息瓶颈理论优化梯度流和表示能力。

Result: 在11个跨5个领域的基准数据集上实现SOTA性能，且无需任何辅助技术，超参数设置一致。

Conclusion: 合理设计的神经网络架构能捕捉时间序列固有特性，可能推动科学和工业应用中的时间序列建模变革。

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the
challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial
correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly
repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g.,
Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time
series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone
with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic
backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition).
We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide
excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for
spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that
FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information
processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling,
while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior
gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or
sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark
datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation,
environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent
hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without
any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural
architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially
transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF方法将人类决策简化为孤立任务（如分类或回归），未能充分模拟人类多策略整合的决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法 consistently 优于现有评分RL方法，部分情况下甚至超越传统RL方法。

Conclusion: 联合建模多任务的RL方法能更有效对齐人类决策模式，为RLHF提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

TL;DR: LaDCast是全球首个基于潜在扩散模型的中期集合天气预报框架，通过潜在空间高效生成集合预报，性能接近欧洲中期天气预报中心IFS-ENS，且在极端事件追踪上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报(NWP)和机器学习方法在准确概率天气预报中面临计算负担重和不确定性量化效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用自编码器压缩ERA5再分析数据至潜在空间，结合基于Transformer的扩散模型生成序列预报，引入GeoRoPE处理地球球面几何，双流注意力机制和正弦时间嵌入捕捉季节模式。

Result: LaDCast在确定性和概率性预报技能上接近IFS-ENS，极端事件（如气旋）轨迹预测更准确，潜在空间计算使存储和计算量大幅降低。

Conclusion: LaDCast为实时公里级分辨率天气预报提供了可行路径，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and
efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We
introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range
ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a
learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5
reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based
diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour
initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding
(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream
attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal
embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and
probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast
demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as
cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.
By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of
magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale
resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the
training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法在通信效率、模型精度和计算成本间难以平衡，存在聚合噪声或高开销问题。

Method: FLoRIST采用奇异值分解单独处理本地适配器，在紧凑中间空间表示信息，并通过可调阈值选择最优全局低秩适配器。

Result: 实验表明FLoRIST在同构和异构设置下均实现了最佳通信效率与性能平衡。

Conclusion: FLoRIST为联邦学习中LLM的高效微调提供了数学精确且低开销的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

methods, offering a simple and intuitive interface and a seamless conversion
from centralized to federated training tasks. FedRAG is also deeply integrated

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的离线强化学习轨迹聚类方法，通过策略引导的K-means和自编码器实现有效聚类，解决了策略诱导冲突带来的聚类模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决离线强化学习数据集中轨迹聚类的问题，通过聚类中心表示生成轨迹的策略，为离线RL提供更有效的分析工具。

Method: 提出了两种方法：策略引导K-means（PG-Kmeans）通过迭代训练行为克隆策略分配轨迹；中心吸引自编码器（CAAE）通过引导潜在表示实现聚类。

Result: 在D4RL数据集和自定义GridWorld环境中验证了方法的有效性，能够将轨迹划分为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans和CAAE为基于策略的轨迹聚类提供了有效框架，适用于离线RL及其他广泛领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LaSDI框架在处理复杂或高频问题时，自编码器难以同时准确重构训练数据并满足潜在空间动力学约束，因此需要改进。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，分阶段训练多个自编码器，每个阶段的自编码器学习修正前一阶段的误差。

Result: mLaSDI方法在小型自编码器上实现了更低的预测和重构误差，同时训练时间比LaSDI更短。

Conclusion: mLaSDI通过分阶段训练显著提升了LaSDI框架的性能，适用于复杂或高频问题的降阶建模。

Abstract: Determining accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an important task in many scientific disciplines. However, solvers
can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order
models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was
proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the
training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This
allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional
ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous
problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing
training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,
particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose
multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several
autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns
to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with
small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while
also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.

Motivation: 研究动机源于强化学习和视觉应用中，标准池化方法（如AvgPool、MaxPool、ClsToken）在输入信噪比波动时易出现性能崩溃的问题。

Method: 将池化问题建模为向量量化，以最小化信号损失为目标，提出一种基于注意力的自适应池化方法，理论上可逼近信号最优向量量化器。

Conclusion: 基于注意力的自适应池化方法能有效提升Transformer在噪声环境下的性能稳定性，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘技术分类方法多基于技术特性，而忽略了更根本的意图维度——是真正移除内部知识还是仅抑制其行为表现。论文旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的理解框架。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于意图的分类法，并围绕该分类法进行了三项主要工作：重新审视遗忘方法的实际效果、调查现有评估策略、指出实际应用中的挑战。

Result: 发现许多移除方法可能仅实现了行为抑制而非真正移除；现有评估指标和基准存在局限性；实际应用中存在可扩展性和连续遗忘等挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成式AI中的遗忘技术提供了一个全面的理解框架，旨在支持未来研究并指导数据移除和隐私相关的政策决策。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine
learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or
knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques
have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering
hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by
their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more
fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks
to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects.
In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented
perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First,
we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may
functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is
necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies,
identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions
for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we
highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential
unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods.
In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and
advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and
guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.

Method: 提出MindRAG框架，整合多模态RAG技术和定制化向量存储结构，利用现有标注和工单数据训练预测模型。

Result: 初步实验表明，MindRAG能有效管理警报并提供可解释的决策支持，提升CM系统效率。

Conclusion: MindRAG通过LLM与CM工作流结合，显著改善工业场景中的故障监测与决策自动化能力。

Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and
efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems
effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation,
and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The
analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems
typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading
to increased workload and reduced efficiency.
  This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with
CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false
alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and
offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework
combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector
store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages
existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a
supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training
predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.
  The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry
CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with
LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM
data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing
real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for
integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios.
Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst,
indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient
management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

Result: 在24个数据集的测试中，CFMI表现优于9种传统和现代方法，且在时间序列数据填补上计算效率更高。

Conclusion: CFMI在低维和高维数据上均表现优异，成为广泛适用的填补方法。

Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new
general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous
normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with
intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine
classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to
moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms
both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying
the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches
the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in
terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as
traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to
high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep
learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range
of data types and dimensionalities.

Motivation: 传统的基于时序差分误差的经验回放策略容易偏好噪声样本，即使价值估计已接近目标均值。这种现象类似于探索文献中的“噪声电视问题”，即智能体因将噪声误认为新颖性而陷入困境。

Method: 论文提出使用认知不确定性估计来指导经验回放中的样本优先选择。认知不确定性量化了可以通过学习减少的不确定性，从而减少从不可预测的随机过程中采样的样本。

Result: 在两个表格模型（多臂老虎机和噪声网格世界）中验证了方法的有效性，并在Atari游戏中超越了分位数回归深度Q学习基准。

Conclusion: 认知不确定性优先回放为强化学习智能体提供了一种有效减少噪声干扰的路径，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting
relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of
contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically,
transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However,
this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value
estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the
noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which
exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate
the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic
uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the
replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be
reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer
generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits
of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple
multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our
prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression
deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty
prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions
and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However,
existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical
data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies
and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that
automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design
with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop
to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships,
guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by
estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically,
G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with
respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct
parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior
distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and
stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence,
G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating
data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要奖励信号和动作信息，限制了在无监督或部分观测环境中的应用。本文旨在通过自监督学习状态表示，减少对外部信息的依赖。

Method: 提出最小动作距离（MAD）作为状态间转换的基本度量，通过自监督学习构建嵌入空间，使嵌入距离反映MAD，支持对称和非对称近似。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种环境（确定性/随机性、离散/连续状态空间、含噪声观测）中能高效学习准确的MAD表示，且显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAD框架为无监督状态表示提供了通用解决方案，支持目标导向强化学习等下游任务，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural
language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health
record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the
southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the
UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma
keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for
additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics,
we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually
reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion
topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms
associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis
among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific
demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at
least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with
HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including
"Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited
Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so
on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences.
Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and
related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable,
time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional
questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

*Yeonju Ro,Zhenyu Zhang,Souvik Kundu,Zhangyang Wang,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DSLA的双状态线性注意力机制和SERVE自适应蒸馏框架，旨在解决大语言模型在处理长输入时的高计算成本问题，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在处理长输入时面临高昂的计算和内存成本，而现有的次二次方法（如线性注意力）虽然能降低成本，但往往会因过度关注近期token而降低准确性。

Method: 论文提出了双状态线性注意力（DSLA），通过维护两个专用隐藏状态（一个用于保存历史上下文，一个用于跟踪近期信息）来缓解线性注意力架构的短程偏差。此外，还引入了SERVE框架，通过基于敏感度的层排序在推理时逐步用DSLA层替换Transformer层，并使用链式微调策略确保新转换的DSLA层与之前替换的层保持一致。

Result: 在常识推理、长上下文QA和文本摘要等任务上的广泛评估表明，SERVE比Llama2-7B快2.3倍，比混合Zamba-7B快3.0倍，同时在下游任务中保持可比性能。消融研究表明，DSLA的双状态能够捕捉全局和局部依赖关系，解决了先前线性注意力中历史token代表性不足的问题。

Conclusion: DSLA和SERVE框架在保持模型性能的同时显著提高了推理效率，为解决大语言模型处理长输入时的计算成本问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via
self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.
While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,
they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,
we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel
design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving
historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the
short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance
efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce
\textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that
progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time,
guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained
fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains
consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality.
Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text
summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference
than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while
retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies
show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,
addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear
attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Conclusion: InstructPro能根据功能描述生成高精度的配体结合蛋白，验证了语言指令在蛋白质设计中的有效性。

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法忽视现实数据中的偏差，导致模型学习虚假相关性并在任务间传递放大，影响知识保留和迁移能力。

Method: 提出ErrorEraser插件，包含无先验的偏差样本识别模块和通过决策空间偏移擦除错误知识的模块，采用增量特征分布学习降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明ErrorEraser显著减轻数据偏差负面影响，在三种CL方法中实现更高准确率和更低遗忘率。

Conclusion: 主动遗忘偏差引起的错误记忆能有效提升持续学习性能，ErrorEraser作为通用插件具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available

Result: 论文提出了对抗替代风险的收敛速率界限，并提供了标准学习场景下具有独立价值的分布相关风险界限。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了对抗训练理论分析的空白，为理解替代风险与分类风险的收敛关系提供了量化工具，同时扩展了标准学习场景的理论框架。

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing
sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the
adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known
as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at
which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for
such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This
paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.
Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the
standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent
interest.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Conclusion: LPO通过优化位置偏好，有效解决了GUI交互中的定位问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Motivation: 扩散蒸馏技术虽能降低扩散模型的采样成本，但存在训练时间长和学生模型性能下降的问题。近期研究表明引入GAN目标可能缓解这些问题，但其机制尚不明确。本文旨在探索这一机制并提出改进方案。

Method: 首先分析扩散蒸馏的局限性，发现师生模型步长和参数数量不匹配导致局部最优解不同。随后证明仅用GAN目标（无需蒸馏损失）即可将扩散模型转化为高效一步生成器。基于此，提出扩散训练可作为生成预训练，并通过轻量级GAN微调解锁模型能力。

Result: 通过微调预训练模型（85%参数冻结），仅需0.2M图像即可实现强性能，5M图像时接近SOTA结果。频域分析进一步解释了一步生成能力的来源。

Conclusion: 本文提出扩散训练是一种强大的生成预训练过程，可作为构建高效一步生成模型的基础，为扩散模型的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost
of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student
performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN
objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:
mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student
model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct
imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,
without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is
sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.
Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a
form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be
unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a
one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of
parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and
near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain
analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in
diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion
training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process,
which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate
electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship
between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local
frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves
global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor
products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful
SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates
and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of
SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed
within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the
symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and
MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a
wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong
generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames
offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of
electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library

Conclusion: EAM作为一种即插即用框架，有效结合了DRL和GA的优势，为组合优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their
discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly
from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and
susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such
as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but
are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,
we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and
plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the
global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned
policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as
crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected
into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating
convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an
upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and
the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL
solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on
benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM
significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over
competitive baselines.

Motivation: 大语言模型在分布外样本上表现不佳，主要因预训练中习得的伪相关性导致。

Result: 在CLadder和PrOntoQA数据集上，3B模型仅用100个样本即超越传统微调和更大模型。

Conclusion: CAPT能有效提升小样本下的模型泛化性能，且具有样本高效性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during
pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through
causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into
two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event
intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional
fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability.
Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical
reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with
CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution
(ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across
geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field
of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization
errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied,
their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the
generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data
and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world
applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained
generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient
decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild
assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or
rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed
light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic
gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on
the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that
Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the
generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the
data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical
experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效检测非活跃特征组，显著提升计算效率且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的筛选规则可安全用于现有优化算法，确保与原始方法相同的结果，显著提升计算效率和内存使用。

Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse
learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for
the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block
non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid
or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant
computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios.
To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the
Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero
coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding
these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in
computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening
rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and
stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can
be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same
results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our
method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Stained Glass Transform的方法，通过在LLM的词嵌入上应用随机、序列相关的变换，在保护输入数据隐私的同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI计算基础设施的高成本和大型语言模型(LLM)服务部署的挑战，企业常采用共享计算资源。但明文数据处理导致敏感数据所有者对这类部署持谨慎态度，限制了数据使用。

Method: 引入Stained Glass Transform方法，对LLM的词嵌入进行随机、序列相关的变换，从信息论角度提供输入数据的隐私保护，同时保持模型效用。

Result: 通过理论分析将特定类别的Stained Glass Transform与高斯混合模型的互信息理论联系起来，计算后验隐私估计，并通过token级隐私指标和标准LLM性能基准验证了变换后嵌入的隐私性和效用。

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform方法有效解决了共享计算环境下LLM部署中的数据隐私问题，在保护敏感信息的同时保持了模型性能，为安全使用LLM提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax损失函数在大规模对象空间中存在显著的计算开销和扩展性限制，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过泰勒展开Softmax损失函数，提出RG²和RG×两种新损失函数，并结合ALS优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在真实数据集上达到或超过Softmax损失的排序性能，同时显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为相似性学习社区提供了理论见解和高效工具，适用于需要平衡排序质量和计算效率的广泛任务。

Abstract: Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity
learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled
through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal
structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely
adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global
negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application
scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from
significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to
large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss
formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the
Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the
Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through
Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic
mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and
uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based
loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the
highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing
both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while
significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity
learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools,
with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking
quality and computational efficiency is essential.

Abstract: We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL
divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects
and papers. The first major pitfall is to differentiate through the KL estimate
as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations
are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly,
we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of
the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate
the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and
show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

TL;DR: 提出EnerBridge-DPO框架，通过结合马尔可夫桥与直接偏好优化，直接预测低能量高稳定性的蛋白质序列，同时保持序列恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在蛋白质逆折叠中主要关注序列恢复率，而忽略了生成序列的能量稳定性。本文旨在克服这一局限，直接生成低能量、高稳定性的蛋白质序列。

Method: 结合马尔可夫桥与直接偏好优化（DPO），利用能量偏好微调模型，并引入显式能量约束损失，从先验序列中学习能量表示并直接预测序列能量值。

Result: EnerBridge-DPO能设计出能量更低且序列恢复率与先进模型相当的蛋白质复合物序列，并能准确预测不同序列间的ΔΔG值。

Conclusion: EnerBridge-DPO框架成功实现了低能量高稳定性蛋白质序列的设计，同时保持了序列恢复率，为蛋白质逆折叠提供了新方法。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein
sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused
on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无奖励马尔可夫决策过程方法——选项核贝尔曼方程（OKBEs），通过构建和优化状态-时间选项核（STOK）来实现目标完成概率最大化并避免约束违反。STOK具有组合性、模块化和可解释性，支持高效的高维规划和验证。

Motivation: 传统基于奖励最大化的方法在组合性、模块化和可解释性方面存在冲突。作者希望通过OKBEs和STOK解决这些问题，支持可验证的长时程规划和内在动机，适用于高维动态世界模型。

Method: 引入状态-时间选项核（STOK）作为预测映射，利用Chapman-Kolmogorov方程进行组合，实现多策略的时空预测。通过分解和重构形式高效表示高维STOK，并记录目标成功和约束违反的概率。

Result: OKBEs和STOK能够高效解决高维规划问题，支持快速合成元策略、跨任务重用规划表示，并通过内在动机函数（如empowerment）验证目标。

Conclusion: OKBEs通过STOK的组合性、模块化和可解释性，提供了一种可扩展的高维动态世界模型规划方法，优于传统的奖励最大化方法。

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和查询复杂度上表现优异，适用于实际部署中的并行偏好查询收集。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov
decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference
comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Motivation: 尽管多层感知机（MLP）在表示各种信号类型方面表现出色，但基于坐标的MLP常面临过拟合和训练区域外泛化能力不足的问题，导致外推性能较差。本文旨在解决具有周期性特性的信号表示问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的网络架构，能够从测量数据中提取周期性模式，并利用这些信息来表示信号，从而提升泛化能力和外推性能。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入周期性模式提取的网络架构，显著提升了信号表示的泛化能力和外推性能，为周期性信号处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Athena-PRM是一种多模态过程奖励模型，通过弱-强完成者预测一致性高效生成高质量过程标注数据，仅需5000样本即可在多个场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过程奖励模型(PRM)需要大量时间和资金进行步骤级标注，且自动标注方法常产生噪声标签并计算成本高。

Method: 利用弱-强完成者的预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的筛选标准，并提出ORM初始化和负数据上采样两种策略优化PRM性能。

Result: 在三个场景中验证：测试时间缩放验证、推理步骤正确性直接评估和奖励排名微调。Qwen2.5-VL-7B作为策略模型时，WeMath提升10.2分，MathVista提升7.1分；VisualProcessBench上F1-score超越之前SOTA 3.9分。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM能高效评估推理步骤正确性，其奖励排名微调训练的Athena-7B在五个基准测试上显著优于基线。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常独立建模时空动态且忽略因果驱动的概率预测，导致预测能力受限。STOAT旨在解决这一问题，通过整合空间依赖性和因果推理提升预测准确性。

Method: STOAT通过空间关系矩阵编码区域间依赖关系（如邻近性或连通性），结合深度概率模型估计分布参数，支持多种输出分布（如高斯、Student-t、拉普拉斯）以捕捉区域特异性。

Result: 在六国COVID-19数据上的实验表明，STOAT在关键指标上优于DeepAR、DeepVAR等先进概率预测模型，尤其在强空间依赖性区域表现突出。

Conclusion: STOAT通过融合因果推理与地理空间概率预测，为复杂时空任务（如疫情管理）提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal
observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across
geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and
temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic
forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT
(Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework
for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal
inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes
interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially
informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by
deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions,
enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output
distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture
region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries
demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting
models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics,
particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal
inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a
generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic
management.

Result: 在D4RL和V-D4RL的28个任务上验证，MOORL性能优于现有离线和混合RL方法，计算开销小，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: MOORL有效结合离线和在线RL的优势，提升学习效率和探索能力，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL,
which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected
datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is
constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit
policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework
that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While
previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added
computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces
a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories.
This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while
utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by
effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added
complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL
benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational
overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for
practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在高风险应用中需要可靠的校准，但现有研究对基础模型（如ConvNeXt、EVA、BEiT）的校准特性探索不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，并挑战现有校准范式的认知。

Method: 通过实证分析，研究基础模型在分布内和分布偏移下的校准行为，并测试后处理校准技术的有效性。

Result: 基础模型在分布内预测中倾向于欠自信，导致校准误差较高；但在分布偏移时校准表现更好。后处理校准技术能有效改善分布内欠自信问题，但在严重分布偏移时效果下降甚至适得其反。

Conclusion: 架构和训练创新对校准的影响复杂且非单调，挑战了持续改进的传统观点。基础模型的校准行为需要更细致的评估方法。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep
neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to
exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts.
Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated
significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration
properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing
insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows
that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions,
resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved
calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in
the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate
underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable
under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive
results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of
architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established
narratives of continuous improvement.

Abstract: Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of
tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore,
existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with
large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the
Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random
projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate
randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem.
Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are
established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework
tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm
is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale
tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified
nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for
several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized
situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for
large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated
into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate
the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要针对注意力机制，无法有效处理状态空间模型中的时间共享和离散化状态转移矩阵，导致模型参数量大、部署困难。

Method: SparseSSM扩展了经典OBS框架，通过近似二阶显著性评分、组件敏感性分析指导剪枝，并支持半结构化和结构化稀疏化。

Conclusion: SparseSSM为状态空间模型提供了高效、无需微调的剪枝方案，揭示了模型冗余分布，并支持多种稀疏化形式。

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while
permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of
parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are
tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and
discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space
module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free
pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS)
framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an
approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace
information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity
analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on
where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to
semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM
weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving
the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

Result: GLGENN在等变函数估计和凸包实验等任务中优于或匹配基线模型，且参数显著减少。

Conclusion: GLGENN通过几何代数实现高效且泛化性强的等变学习，为复杂变换下的模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of
equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized
Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are
equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and
reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes
into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras.
Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less
tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or
matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including
estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using
significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data
generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for
data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the
potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting
underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of
unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world
settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this
paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context
examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that
even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further
introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias
into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately
compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and
protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated
with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with
in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个联邦学习下视觉语言模型（VLM）微调的系统性基准FedVLMBench，涵盖多种架构、策略和任务，揭示了数据异质性对模型性能的影响，并提供了优化配置建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLM）的微调多依赖集中式训练，难以满足医疗等隐私敏感领域的需求。尽管联邦学习（FL）被引入以解决隐私问题，但缺乏全面的评估基准。

Method: 论文提出FedVLMBench基准，整合两种主流VLM架构（基于编码器与非编码器）、四种微调策略、五种FL算法、六个多模态数据集，覆盖单任务和多任务场景。

Result: 实验发现，基于编码器的VLM在FL中最优配置为2层MLP连接器并同步调优；FL方法在视觉中心任务中对数据异质性更敏感。

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态基础模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实证指导，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: SyncFed提出了一种基于时间同步的联邦学习框架，通过时间戳量化客户端更新的陈旧性，提升模型准确性和信息新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在分布式环境中面临网络延迟、时钟不同步和客户端更新不一致等问题，现有方法缺乏量化陈旧性的机制。

Method: SyncFed采用显式同步和时间戳技术，基于NTP协议量化更新陈旧性，并在聚合时进行时间感知加权。

Result: 实验表明，SyncFed在分布式测试环境中能稳定模型训练，相比传统方法提升了准确性和信息新鲜度。

Conclusion: SyncFed通过时间同步机制有效解决了联邦学习中的陈旧性问题，优化了模型性能。

Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed
environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays,
clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of
factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model
reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation
and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms
to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional
deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a
time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping
to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is
quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of
client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our
empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under
\emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context,
resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to
round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.

Motivation: 联邦学习中异常客户端（如数据损坏或分布不具代表性）会显著降低模型性能，但如何在保护隐私的前提下检测这些客户端仍是一大挑战。

Method: 提出WAFFLE算法，通过小波散射变换或傅里叶变换生成低维任务无关嵌入，利用轻量级检测器在公共数据集上训练，实现无监督客户端分离。

Result: 实验表明，WAFFLE在检测准确性和下游分类性能上优于现有方法，验证了其作为预训练替代方案的有效性。

Conclusion: WAFFLE为联邦学习提供了一种高效、隐私保护的异常客户端检测方法，尤其小波变换因其不可逆性和局部形变稳定性更具优势。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models
across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the
presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors
or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model
performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key
challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated
Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before
training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from
either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both
approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for
unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a
distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication
and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection,
WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to
local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated
scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves
detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to
existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a
pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入Wasserstein距离作为聚合方法，有效提升了超图神经网络的表达能力，为高阶关系建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven
advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While
graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade,
representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining
momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have
emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The
messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However,
most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart,
often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper
we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats
the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the
information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators
such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach
has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of
distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one
hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of
optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein
pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification
tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在生成和分类任务中表现优异，但其输出常无法满足时序约束，如有限轨迹上的线性时序逻辑（LTLf）。

Method: TRIDENT将LTLf公式编译为确定性有限自动机（DFA），通过约束束搜索动态屏蔽违规路径并重排剩余路径。

Result: TRIDENT在图像流分类和受控文本生成任务中实现100%约束满足，且输出质量和效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该算法为模型无关的时序约束解决方案，在保证合规性的同时提升生成质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

Motivation: 深度神经网络中增加深度常带来计算冗余而表示质量提升有限，需要一种能自动适应任务复杂度的高效架构。

Method: 引入Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs)，用从每层到输出的长前馈连接替代短残差连接，通过梯度下降实现信息自动压缩。

Result: ACNs在减少灾难性遗忘、架构压缩、噪声鲁棒性、低数据场景和迁移学习方面表现优异，最高减少18%遗忘和80%压缩。

Conclusion: ACNs是一种高效且自动适应任务复杂度的神经网络架构，能学习更鲁棒的表示并减少计算冗余。

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated
remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces
computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation
quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an
architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each
layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs
showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a
network to organically compress information during training with gradient
descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,
information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training,
enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in
deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise
training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during
training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced
noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in
low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that
generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to
18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression
while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT
architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional
pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance
trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish
ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that
automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while
learning robust representations.

Method: 提出AtmosMJ，一种直接在ERA5数据上运行的深度卷积网络，采用新型门控残差融合(GRF)机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ能稳定预测约500天，10天预测精度媲美Pangu-Weather等模型，且仅需5.7天V100 GPU时间训练。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计（而非非标准数据表示）是实现长期稳定天气预测的关键。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and
relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing
multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for
specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal
graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of
Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across
diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of
multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent
multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.
Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)
unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of
handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context
learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)
multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review
related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards
realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing
multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper
can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for
generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上的实验表明，Load-aware Tram-FL显著减少了训练时间并加速了收敛，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Load-aware Tram-FL通过优化调度机制，有效减少了去中心化联邦学习的训练时间，提升了整体效率。

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle:
embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs
are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed
and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive
framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In
this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based
on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative
pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs
is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain
threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating
within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller
batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches,
which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address
this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that
reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results
demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the
performance of CL methods in small-batch training.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

*Minoh Jeong,Alfred Hero*

TL;DR: 论文提出ProjNCE，一种统一监督与自监督对比学习的目标函数，通过投影函数和负样本调整项改进监督对比学习，并在多个数据集上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督对比学习（SupCon）在表示学习中的研究较少，尤其是其与互信息（MI）的关系尚未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入ProjNCE，扩展InfoNCE损失，通过投影函数和负样本调整项统一监督与自监督对比目标，并证明其是有效的MI下界。

Result: 实验表明，ProjNCE在多个数据集和设置中 consistently 优于监督对比学习和标准交叉熵训练。

Conclusion: ProjNCE从互信息解释和投影设计两个角度改进了监督对比学习，为其作为基础目标时提供了广泛适用的改进。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple
perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However,
supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little
attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to
form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon
and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a
generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised
contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment
term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and
affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class
embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based
class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that
ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy
training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary
perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and
offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the
foundational contrastive objective.

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种评估指标子集选择的代表性定义，并探讨其理论边界与实际应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM评估中，如何从众多指标中选择具有代表性的子集是一个常见但定义模糊的问题，论文旨在通过社会选择理论来形式化这一概念。

Method: 引入位置代表性和位置比例性两种代表性定义，并研究其理论边界及允许分组输入时的扩展形式。

Result: 证明了在最坏情况下满足这两种属性所需的最小指标数量上下界，并通过实际案例验证了理论。

Conclusion: 论文为评估指标子集选择提供了理论框架，并在实际应用中展示了其有效性。

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from
a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for
efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a
``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely
clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to
formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of
evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which
guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position
cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no
alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small
error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number
of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We
also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input
on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to
practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital
quality evaluation.

Motivation: 动态系统建模是科学研究的核心，但稀疏线性ODE的可辨识性问题在实际应用中尚未充分探索，尤其在生物、社会和物理系统中稀疏性普遍存在。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，探讨稀疏线性ODE的可辨识性，并评估现有估计方法在实际中的表现。

Result: 稀疏线性ODE在实际相关稀疏性条件下存在不可辨识性的正概率，且理论限制无法通过归纳偏置或优化动态解决。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新思考数据驱动动态系统建模的预期，并为评估学习到的线性ODE的可信度提供量化依据。

Abstract: Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across
natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned
from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are
not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior
under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer
the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory."
However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains
underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally
in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this
gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to
the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive
probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds
for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical
unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs
from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically
unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive
biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be
expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative
assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

Motivation: 联邦学习中拜占庭参与者可能提交有害梯度破坏模型收敛。现有方法假设诚实梯度相似，但在数据异构场景下该假设不成立，导致难以区分恶意梯度。

Method: 提出Worker Label Alignment Loss (WoLA)，一种加权损失函数，通过强制对齐诚实工作节点的梯度来增强拜占庭攻击的识别能力。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，WoLA在数据异构环境下显著优于现有拜占庭防御方法。

Conclusion: WoLA通过梯度对齐有效解决了异构数据下的拜占庭攻击问题，为联邦学习安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple
data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing
their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally
update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or
model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it
opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine)
participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming
model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that
the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this
purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation,
assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than
honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest
gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest
outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label
Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients
despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines'
gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and
empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在处理大规模图数据时面临内存需求和稀疏矩阵计算效率的挑战，量子计算（QC）为解决这些问题提供了新思路。然而，当前量子硬件限制了数据编码的维度，现有方法要么简化数据集，要么使用人工图数据。

Method: 提出了Guided Graph Compression（GGC）框架，利用图自编码器压缩节点数量和特征维度，并通过下游分类任务指导压缩过程，适用于量子或经典分类器。

Result: 在Jet Tagging任务中，GGC表现优于单独使用自编码器预处理和经典GNN分类器基线，同时支持在真实数据集上测试新型QGNN架构。

Conclusion: GGC框架有效解决了大规模图数据处理的挑战，为量子图神经网络的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，分类准确率达到99.41%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有小型化、高效和高性能的特点，适用于工业环境中的快速油品表征。

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the
classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties,
utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils,
governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the
sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are
systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve
as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant
sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly
well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is
developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the
corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated
using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in
distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the
random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil
identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high
performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization
in industrial environments.

Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the
clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the
clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an
information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while
ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the
countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable
pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown
to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous
setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with
the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of
verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private
information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy
guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms
the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure
aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order
estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL
tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.

Motivation: 现有研究主要基于高斯输入和Hermite展开分析单索引模型，但忽略了问题的旋转对称性本质。本文旨在通过球谐函数这一更自然的基函数来重新审视该问题。

Method: 提出基于张量展开和在线SGD的两类估计器，分别优化样本复杂度和计算效率，并分析其理论性能。

Result: 在任意球对称输入分布下建立了学习复杂度理论，在高斯输入场景中不仅复现了已有结论，还发现了以往被忽视的新现象。

Conclusion: 球谐函数是分析单索引模型的更优框架，同时实现样本和计算双最优的通用估计器可能不存在。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in
\mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through
an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle
\boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under
Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering
$\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function.
In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical
harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis
for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building
on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models
under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two
families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that
respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and
argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized
to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results
but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)能准确描述概率分布，但在生成可靠样本时表现不佳，限制了其在需要随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 引入Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)，一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过提示LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其在温和假设下优于直接采样，提升来自算法和提示设计。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经典概率工具可通过自然语言嵌入LLM工作流，提升可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Motivation: 研究VQVAE在对抗攻击下对射频数据的保护能力，特别是在高信噪比环境下，如何有效抑制攻击并保持数据的可分类性。

Method: 设计VQVAE将射频波形映射到离散潜在空间，生成可完美分类的重建数据；创建并比较相位保持与非保持的对抗攻击；评估VQVAE重建后分类器的准确性。

Conclusion: VQVAE能有效抑制对抗攻击，其离散潜在空间的特性可能有助于攻击检测，为射频数据安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete
latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the
original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when
an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF)
data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally
modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve
the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are
adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same
intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of
such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on
the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of
the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE
of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the
effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the
attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using
multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the
VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we
observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the
attacks.

Conclusion: DNA不仅增强了强化学习的可解释性，还为探索和自适应规划开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to
explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives
(DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for
trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively
diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these
distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of
available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,
DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where
agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which
uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for
distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it
successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute
meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to
related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for
exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

Motivation: 现有针对MU的隐私推断攻击依赖同时访问原始模型和遗忘后模型的较弱威胁模型，限制了实际应用。本文旨在设计一种更严格的威胁模型下仍能有效攻击的方法。

Method: 提出后验标签成员推断攻击Apollo，仅需访问遗忘后模型的标签输出，通过分析输出推断样本是否被遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，Apollo在更严格的威胁模型下（仅访问标签输出），仍能对遗忘样本的成员状态实现较高精度的推断。

Conclusion: Apollo攻击证明即使严格限制攻击者对模型的访问权限，MU系统仍面临隐私泄露风险，需设计更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following
requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model
efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU
itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory
compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing
privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the
unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has
access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their
feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A
Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that
infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat
model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model
only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to
the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high
precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems.
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix
factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors,
allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior
distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address
this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We
evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence
speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出CLAReps方法，通过条件扩散模型提取类别核心特征，提升下游任务的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型（CDMs）在生成任务中表现优异，但其全数据分布建模能力导致类别特征与无关上下文纠缠，影响特征提取的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 提出CLAReps（典型潜在表示），通过CDM提取保留类别核心信息、过滤无关信号的潜在编码，并基于此开发CaDistill特征蒸馏框架。

Result: 学生模型仅需10%训练数据规模的CLAReps即可学习核心类别知识，在对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力上表现优异。

Conclusion: CDMs不仅能生成图像，还可作为紧凑、可解释的教师模型驱动鲁棒表征学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

TL;DR: Multiverse是一种新型并行生成模型，通过MapReduce范式实现原生并行生成，性能媲美主流自回归大模型，并实现2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型（AR-LLMs）隐式并行性的启发，提出Multiverse模型以实现原生并行生成，提升推理效率。

Method: 采用三阶段MapReduce范式（任务分解、并行执行、结果合成），设计Multiverse Attention算法保持与因果注意力的兼容性，并开发专用引擎实现动态并行推理。

Result: 仅用1K样本微调3小时的Multiverse-32B模型，在AIME24/25上分别取得54%和46%的成绩，相同上下文长度下性能平均提升1.87%，推理速度最高提升2倍。

Conclusion: Multiverse证明了非自回归模型可达到与自回归模型相当的性能，同时显著提升效率，其完整生态系统已开源。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种校准过程奖励模型（PRM）的方法，通过分位数回归调整PRM输出以更准确预测成功概率，并基于此设计动态调整推理预算的自适应推理框架（IAS），在数学推理任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM模型存在校准不足、常高估成功概率的问题，导致推理效率低下。需要改进PRM校准并开发动态推理策略以优化计算资源分配。

Method: 1) 使用分位数回归校准PRM输出；2) 提出实例自适应推理框架（IAS），根据校准后的成功概率动态调整推理步数。

Result: 1) PRM校准误差显著降低；2) IAS框架在保持准确率的同时减少33%推理计算量；3) 校准对自适应推理效果至关重要。

Conclusion: 校准后的PRM结合IAS框架能有效平衡推理成本与准确率，为LLM推理优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time
scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that
even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate
success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach,
performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align
with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates
and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive
scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on
the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a
correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number
of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each
instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method
successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline
methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling,
and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining
final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as
desired.

Motivation: 现有Transformer在多粒子跟踪中虽能处理组合爆炸问题，但在局部稀疏场景下性能仍不及传统贝叶斯滤波方法，需结合两者优势。

Result: 该方法在存在杂波干扰的场景中表现出更高的跟踪准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 混合框架有效融合了Transformer的表示学习能力与贝叶斯滤波的局部最优性，适用于高噪声多目标跟踪。

Abstract: Tracking multiple particles in noisy and cluttered scenes remains challenging
due to a combinatorial explosion of trajectory hypotheses, which scales
super-exponentially with the number of particles and frames. The transformer
architecture has shown a significant improvement in robustness against this
high combinatorial load. However, its performance still falls short of the
conventional Bayesian filtering approaches in scenarios presenting a reduced
set of trajectory hypothesis. This suggests that while transformers excel at
narrowing down possible associations, they may not be able to reach the
optimality of the Bayesian approach in locally sparse scenario. Hence, we
introduce a hybrid tracking framework that combines the ability of
self-attention to learn the underlying representation of particle behavior with
the reliability and interpretability of Bayesian filtering. We perform
trajectory-to-detection association by solving a label prediction problem,
using a transformer encoder to infer soft associations between detections
across frames. This prunes the hypothesis set, enabling efficient
multiple-particle tracking in Bayesian filtering framework. Our approach
demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious
detections, offering a solution for high clutter multiple particle tracking
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPI预测依赖低频调查数据，大语言模型的出现为利用高频在线文本数据提升预测精度提供了新机会。

Method: 收集中文社交网络高频文本，使用ChatGPT和BERT模型构建通胀标签，结合LDA和BERT提取文本嵌入，建立ARX和VARX时间序列模型融合CPI数据与文本特征。

Result: 通过模拟和实际数据验证，LLM-CPI在有限样本中表现良好，并提供了两种预测区间构建形式。

Conclusion: LLM-CPI方法有效整合文本数据与传统经济指标，为CPI预测提供了新的高频分析框架。

Abstract: Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging
task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency,
survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs),
there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for
improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes
LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating
online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts
from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as
ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels
for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted
via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines
monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model
employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and
macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on
LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic
properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction
intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI
are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in analyzing the behavior of machine learning
systems against adversarial attacks. However, most of the research in
adversarial machine learning has focused on studying weaknesses against evasion
or poisoning attacks to predictive models in classical setups, with the
susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to attacks remaining
underexplored. This paper introduces a general methodology for designing
optimal evasion attacks against such models. We investigate two adversarial
objectives: perturbing specific point predictions and altering the entire
posterior predictive distribution. For both scenarios, we propose novel
gradient-based attacks and study their implementation and properties in various
computational setups.

Result: 实证结果表明预测不确定性存在与数据集和模型大小相关的缩放规律。

Conclusion: 研究结果反驳了'大数据下无需贝叶斯方法'的观点，证明认知不确定性在大数据下仍显著存在。

Abstract: Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws,
demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on
dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena
emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do
similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In
identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a
straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this
case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic
uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in
over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely
unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of
scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with
respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language
tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive
uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and
ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical
utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work
provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian
approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data
available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data"
is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.

Motivation: 研究DDPMs在分数评估中面对噪声时的鲁棒性，并量化其性能，以验证其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过实证分析和理论推导，评估DDPMs在噪声干扰下的表现，并建立Wasserstein-2距离的有限样本保证。

Result: DDPMs对恒定方差噪声具有鲁棒性，且收敛速度优于先前已知结果，与高斯情况下的最优速率一致。

Conclusion: DDPMs在噪声环境下表现稳健，且理论结果验证了其最优性，为实际应用提供了可靠的理论基础。

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to produce new random examples from an unknown
target distribution, given access to a finite collection of examples. Among the
leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct
such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an
estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence
that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We
then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit
two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to
noisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than
previously known results. Furthermore, we observe that the obtained rates match
those known in the Gaussian case, implying their optimality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 岩溶网络的模拟由于其在各种地质和水文地质背景下长期发生的复杂物理化学过程而具有挑战性，这些过程导致了多种多样的岩溶网络模式，每种模式都与特定的水文地质条件密切相关。

Method: 论文采用了两步生成方法：首先使用GraphRNN学习岩溶网络的拓扑分布，然后利用G-DDPM学习节点特征（空间坐标和其他属性），确保生成的图符合学习的统计特性。

Result: 通过使用真实世界的岩溶网络进行测试，并利用几何和拓扑指标比较生成的子图与实际子图，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够对不同类型岩溶构造进行随机模拟，为研究如流动和传输等物理过程的行为提供了有用工具。

Abstract: The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge
due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various
geological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex
interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately
linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that
represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep
learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In
this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while
edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two
main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to
learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the
graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by
previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion
probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial
coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes
features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned
statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,
ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential
features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst
networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the
database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows
stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of
formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such
as flow and transport.

Result: 结果显示，仅基于文本内容，该方法在VoicePrivacy攻击者挑战数据集上的平均等错误率（EER）为35%，某些说话人的EER低至2%。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前数据集存在偏差，建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑依赖全局EER进行隐私评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

Motivation: PE疗法对PTSD有效，但治疗师忠诚度评估依赖人工审核，效率低下。

Method: 使用LoRA微调Qwen2-Audio模型，处理30秒音频-文本窗口，通过LLM生成并验证三个阶段（P1-P3）的标签。

Result: 在313个真实PE会话中，最佳配置（LoRA rank 8, 30s窗口）实现平均绝对误差5.3秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为PE治疗提供了可扩展的忠诚度跟踪框架，有助于临床培训和质量控制。

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Motivation: 神经前端在ASR系统中虽具吸引力，但性能常不及传统方法，主要因易过拟合。本文旨在通过正则化方法提升其性能。

Method: 采用音频扰动方法和改进的SpecAugment策略，提出在STFT域进行掩码以解决可学习前端的局限性。

Result: 结合两种正则化方法后，可学习特征与传统特征之间的性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: 通过有效的正则化策略，可学习特征提取前端在ASR系统中的性能可媲美传统方法。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely
on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof
production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of
DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not
support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and
provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for
proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly
separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the
correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the
abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by
existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for
generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable
scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction
techniques within a formal proof framework.

Motivation: 高深宽比结构中，等离子体与表面反应受表面复合主导，导致饱和时间过长，传统优化方法效率低下。

Conclusion: 机器学习为PEALD工艺优化提供了高效新途径，可扩展至原子层刻蚀及更复杂结构。

Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic
layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based
processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can
dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to
unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside
nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on
simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation
times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated
conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in
undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation
times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine
whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a
PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning
can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in
areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic
layer etching and more complex structures.

interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to
characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task
representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We
find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for
planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)
contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful
maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across
individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and
behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the
effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of
value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives
on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals
represent their environments in aid of planning.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过结构优化方法（基于motif的优化）改进稀疏进化训练（SET）算法在多层感知机（MLP）中的应用，以提高性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络（DNN）模型复杂度的增加，降低计算成本和内存开销的需求日益迫切。稀疏性成为解决这一问题的关键方法。

Method: 研究采用稀疏进化训练（SET）算法，并结合基于motif的结构优化方法，对稀疏多层感知机（MLP）进行优化。

Result: 研究表明，通过结构优化，SET算法可能实现超过40%的效率提升，同时性能下降不超过4%。

Conclusion: 结构优化可以显著提升稀疏进化训练在多层感知机中的性能，同时保持较高的计算效率。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to
Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent
this improvement can be achieved.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets
remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the
use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this
methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube
lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合上下文偏置（CB）方法与预训练语音基础模型（OWSM v3.1）的新方法，显著提升了罕见词识别性能，同时保持了模型的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音基础模型（SFMs）在大规模数据集上训练，但在识别罕见或未见词汇时仍表现不佳。现有的上下文偏置方法因缺乏预训练知识，性能通常不如SFMs。

Method: 论文将现有的CB方法与预训练的OWSM v3.1模型结合，冻结预训练参数，利用SFMs的嵌入知识，在小数据集上实现有效的上下文偏置。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在LibriSpeech 100测试集上，偏置词错误率（B-WER）降低了11.6个百分点，整体WER提升0.9个百分点，实时因子减少7.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合CB与预训练SFMs，显著提升了罕见词识别性能，同时保持了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

Conclusion: BemaGANv2在音频生成中表现出色，代码和预训练权重已开源，促进可复现性。

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a
comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and
implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are

Method: 使用因子化的Monge-Kantorovich线性解在WavLM嵌入子空间替换kNN回归，解决维度间方差不均问题，实现有效特征转换。

Result: 在LibriSpeech和FLEURS数据集上，MKL-VC显著提升了内容保持和鲁棒性，尤其在短参考音频下表现优于kNN-VC，与FACodec性能相当。

Conclusion: Factorized MKL-VC在跨语言语音转换中表现出色，尤其在短参考音频场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Factorized MKL-VC, a training-free modification for

transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich
Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across

Motivation: 受人类利用语言知识（如语法和语义）辅助语音感知的启发，探索预训练语言模型作为AV-TSE的辅助知识来源的潜力。

Method: 将PSLMs或PLMs的语言约束作为额外监督信号整合到AV-TSE模型中，不增加推理时的计算负担。

Result: 该方法显著提升了语音质量和可懂度，在多语言和视觉线索受损场景下也表现出稳健的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入语言模型的语义约束，AV-TSE模型性能得到提升，且具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on
target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know
that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to
support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of
pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models
(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose
incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE
model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra
computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently
improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show
robust performance gains.

Method: 提出UmbraTTS模型，采用流匹配技术联合生成语音和环境音频，并通过自监督框架从无标注录音中提取语音、背景音频和文本。

Result: UmbraTTS显著优于现有基线，能生成自然、高质量且环境感知的音频，支持对背景音量的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: UmbraTTS通过自监督学习解决了数据不足问题，成功实现了环境感知的高质量语音合成。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech
synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains
challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that
jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and
acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume
and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge
is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural
context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a
self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and
transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural,
high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

Result: 实验表明Alice算法混合速度快、扩展性好，且新零模型能发现以往模型未能识别的显著结果。

Conclusion: 新零模型在保留更多数据集特性的同时，能够揭示以往方法无法检测的显著模式，具有更高的实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce novel null models for assessing the results obtained from
observed binary transactional and sequence datasets, using statistical
hypothesis testing. Our null models maintain more properties of the observed
dataset than existing ones. Specifically, they preserve the Bipartite Joint
Degree Matrix of the bipartite (multi-)graph corresponding to the dataset,
which ensures that the number of caterpillars, i.e., paths of length three, is
preserved, in addition to other properties considered by other models. We
describe Alice, a suite of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling
datasets from our null models, based on a carefully defined set of states and
efficient operations to move between them. The results of our experimental
evaluation show that Alice mixes fast and scales well, and that our null model
finds different significant results than ones previously considered in the
literature.

Conclusion: 该方法为不完整基因组数据提供了生物学合理的填补方案，支持更高效的时空建模工作流。

Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its
utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a
probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced

evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from
collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically
plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without
requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly
pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this
approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets

Conclusion: 该研究展示了集成TN-NTN架构在提升网络容量与能源效率方面的潜力，为未来可持续网络设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures
offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for
the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for
these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load
and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less
attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of
terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in
supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online
optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback
Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively
optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment
(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network
capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations
over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the
proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%
throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming
standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

Conclusion: 所提方法在缺失数据下实现了高精度实时流量预测，并提供了理论恢复保证。

Abstract: Real-time network traffic forecasting is crucial for network management and
early resource allocation. Existing network traffic forecasting approaches
operate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed.
However, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to
various human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model
approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly,
we model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem.
Secondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank
structure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model
effectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data
during pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent
representation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing
the high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which
simplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also
establish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of
the proposed approach. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves accurate network traffic forecasting within 100 ms, with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.002, as validated on the Abilene dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但其高计算、内存和功耗需求限制了在边缘设备上的应用。EdgeProfiler旨在解决这一问题，为资源受限的边缘环境提供系统化的LLM性能评估方法。

Method: EdgeProfiler采用激进的量化技术和严格的内存限制，对TinyLLaMA、Gemma3.1B等轻量级LLM进行分析建模，评估延迟、FLOPs和能耗。

Result: 4位量化使模型内存使用减少60-70%，精度损失仅2-5%；推理速度比FP16基线提升2-3倍，INT4配置能耗降低35-50%，适用于树莓派等边缘硬件。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了针对边缘环境定制高效轻量级LLM分析的重要性，在精度、能效和计算可行性之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for
evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs
offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,
their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to
cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a
systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained
edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,
Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization
techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to
estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that
4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while
maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds
are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge
devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for
INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as
Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the
importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge
environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational
feasibility.

Result: 实验表明，SLED显著降低延迟、提高能效、增加并发推理会话，且不损失模型精度。

Conclusion: SLED为边缘计算中的大型语言模型推理提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing
advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to
limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as
aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for
efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces
a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily
as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as
a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating
computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows
lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using
diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches
and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach
supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by
avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments
with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate
substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy
efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without
sacrificing model accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练中的静默错误难以检测和定位，传统调试方法效率低下，尤其在低精度训练中更为困难。

Method: TTrace通过收集分布式训练的中间张量，与单设备参考实现进行比较，并利用数学分析设置阈值区分错误与浮点误差。

Result: TTrace在Megatron-LM框架中成功检测出11个现有错误和3个新错误，且代码改动少于10行。

Conclusion: TTrace在多种训练配置（包括低精度训练）中有效检测和定位静默错误，显著提升调试效率。

Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural
network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs.
However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them
particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signal
but lead to incorrect training outcome. Effectively detecting and localizing
such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging
practice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be
inefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values
and determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is
difficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.
  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system
capable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace
collects intermediate tensors from distributing training in a fine-grained
manner and compares them against those from a trusted single-device reference
implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the tensors,
we propose novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting
thresholds, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from
floating-point round-off errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace
effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used
Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code change.
TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision
recipes involving BF16 and FP8.

inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often
suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative
training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,
however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,
efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized
hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose
multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and
high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a
two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across
cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are
streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling
on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,
ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.
Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch
sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload
characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits
HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to
10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines
such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity
recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy.
Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of
cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

### [200] [Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge: A Coordination Fabric for Billions of Minds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09335)
*Moshi Wei,Sparks Li*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ISEK是一个基于Web3的去中心化认知生态系统，通过AI与人类智能体的对等协作，结合区块链和激励机制，实现自组织和自适应的大规模认知系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在突破传统中心化平台的限制，构建一个抗审查、平等协作且能自主进化的去中心化智能网络。

Method: 采用六阶段工作流（发布、发现、招募、执行、结算、反馈）和NFT身份管理，结合$ISEK代币经济模型与多维信誉系统。

Result: 实现了动态任务分配、容错机制和分布式共识，形成超越中心化约束的涌现智能基础设施。

Conclusion: ISEK代表了从传统平台向去中心化认知系统的范式转变，为自主智能体的有机协同提供了新范式。

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

TL;DR: 论文提出CRAFT系统，通过多智能体红队测试评估任务型LLM代理在客服场景中对策略遵守的鲁棒性，并引入tau-break基准测试现有防御措施的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务型LLM代理需在严格策略下（如退款规则）保持合规性，同时抵御恶意用户的策略绕过行为，但目前缺乏针对性评估方法。

Method: 提出CRAFT多智能体红队系统，采用策略感知的劝说策略攻击合规代理，并构建tau-break基准测试鲁棒性。

Result: CRAFT优于传统越狱方法（如DAN提示、情感操纵等），现有防御措施部分有效但仍不足。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究更强防护机制以保障策略合规代理的安全性。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文研究了异构团队在任务分配中的优势条件，通过理论分析和强化学习算法验证了奖励设计对促进多样性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究异构团队在任务分配中何时优于同构团队，并探讨如何通过奖励设计促进多样性。

Method: 结合理论分析（广义聚合算子曲率）和多智能体强化学习（HED算法）验证异构优势。

Result: 曲率条件决定异构优势，HED算法成功复现理论预测的奖励机制。

Conclusion: 行为多样性在特定奖励机制下具有可衡量的优势，为MARL环境设计提供理论依据。

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

TL;DR: ThinkQE提出了一种基于LLM的查询扩展框架，通过深度语义探索和语料库反馈迭代优化，显著提升网络搜索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的查询扩展方法虽提升了检索性能，但生成的扩展查询往往过于狭窄，忽视了探索性和结果多样性的需求。

Method: ThinkQE包含两个关键组件：基于思考的扩展过程促进深度语义探索，以及通过语料库检索反馈迭代优化扩展的语料交互策略。

Result: 在多个网络搜索基准测试（DL19、DL20和BRIGHT）上，ThinkQE一致优于现有方法，包括训练密集的检索器和重排序器。

Conclusion: ThinkQE通过结合深度语义探索和迭代优化，有效解决了现有查询扩展方法的局限性，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户-商品交互数据噪声大且稀疏，导致互补产品推荐困难，需要更有效的方法来提升推荐效果。

Method: 通过将用户-商品二分图投影为有向加权图，从中推断互补关系，提出新的推荐方法。

Result: 在不同基准测试中，模型性能平均提升43%（优于序列推荐）和38%（优于图推荐）。

Conclusion: 该方法虽简单，但在互补产品推荐任务中显著优于现有方法，验证了二分图投影的有效性。

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation is a powerful strategy to improve
customer experience and retail sales. However, recommending the right product
is not a simple task because of the noisy and sparse nature of user-item
interactions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to predict
a list of complementary products given a query item, based on the structure of
a directed weighted graph projected from the user-item bipartite graph. We
revisit bipartite graph projections for recommender systems and propose a novel
approach for inferring complementarity relationships from historical user-item
interactions. We compare our model with recent methods from the literature and
show, despite the simplicity of our approach, an average improvement of +43%
and +38% over sequential and graph-based recommenders, respectively, over
different benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出UTGenerator和UTBoost框架，通过自动生成测试用例解决SWE-Bench中测试不足导致错误补丁通过的问题，显著影响排行榜结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SWE-Bench基准测试中手动编写的测试用例不足，导致生成的补丁即使未解决问题也能通过测试，需改进测试覆盖。

Method: 开发LLM驱动的UTGenerator自动生成测试用例，并构建UTBoost框架进行测试用例增强。

Result: 在36个任务实例中发现测试不足，纠正了345个错误补丁，影响了SWE-Bench Lite和Verified排行榜的40.9%和24.4%条目。

Conclusion: UTBoost框架有效提升测试覆盖率，显著改善代码生成评估的准确性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard
entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将推理深度作为可控资源来设计代码生成模型，通过显式管理快速思考与慢速思考的权衡，优化整个模型生命周期的推理预算，以实现准确率、延迟和成本的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成模型的推理深度通常是无意中由提示决定的，缺乏显式控制。论文认为，通过管理快速直接回答（快速思考）与详细链式思考（慢速思考）的权衡，可以优化模型性能。

Method: 提出一种自适应控制推理的方法，涵盖从合成数据创建、基准测试到实际部署的整个模型生命周期，通过调度快速和慢速思考模式来优化资源分配。

Result: 该方法能够增强监督信号、推动多维基准测试的发展，并支持成本和安全意识强的部署策略，从而在准确率、延迟和成本之间实现更优的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过将快速和慢速思考视为可调度的互补模式，未来的代码生成代理可以在必要时深入思考，在可能时快速行动，从而提升整体性能。

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation
models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being
an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between
rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought
deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that
optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic
data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior
trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive
control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new
multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious
deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes
to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and
act fast when possible.

Motivation: 探讨现有商业SHI实践对rAI目标的贡献程度及潜在脱节，为未来行业实践转向rAI提供依据。

Method: 分析56份rAI指南以识别SHI目标，并通过在线调查（n=130）和半结构化访谈（n=10）了解商业实践现状。

Result: 商业SHI实践以客户价值和合规等商业目标为主，当前因素阻碍其与rAI目标对齐，现有实践对rAI贡献有限。

Conclusion: 需针对性干预和研究机会，推动商业SHI实践向rAI目标靠拢。

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement
(SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in
commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This
study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to
contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential
insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry
practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to
identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and
uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical
understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To
understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we
then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)
with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily
driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several
factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that
established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To
address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to
advance rAI development in practice.

Motivation: 心理健康问题日益严重的全球性挑战，AI驱动的解决方案有望扩大心理社会支持的可及性。同伴支持虽具价值，但质量、一致性和安全性存在差异，需探索如何通过LLM提升其效果。

Method: 研究采用混合方法，包含两项实验：12名同伴支持者和5名心理健康专家测试了基于LLM的系统，该系统模拟求助者、生成情境化建议并实时可视化情绪。

Result: 两组参与者均认可系统对培训和互动质量的提升潜力，但专家发现同伴支持者常忽略求助信号或过早给出建议，凸显当前培训在情感敏感场景中的不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调需建立基于心理学的标准化培训，并谨慎设计LLM辅助系统，在专家监督下推动同伴支持的全球化扩展，为AI在心理健康领域的负责任应用提供参考。

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing

Conclusion: 该研究为区域文字识别设立了新基准，展示了量子机器学习在低资源语言场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: ReStNet提出了一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接两个预训练模型来构建混合网络，以适应不同设备的资源限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同设备具有异构的计算和内存资源，部署固定模型在现实世界的物联网应用中具有挑战。传统压缩方法（如剪枝、量化和知识蒸馏）一旦应用就变得不灵活，无法适应变化的资源约束。

Method: ReStNet通过计算层间相似性（使用CKA）确定最佳拼接点，保留大容量模型的早期层并附加小容量模型的深层，仅微调拼接层以实现高效部署。

Result: 实验表明，ReStNet在运行时实现了灵活的精度-效率权衡，并显著降低了训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet支持同构和异构模型拼接，能够灵活适应不同资源约束，充分利用可用资源。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式医学视觉-语言模型（Med-VLMs）在生成复杂文本信息（如诊断报告）方面表现出色，但其安全性问题尚未充分研究。模型需要能够拒绝有害查询（如保险欺诈指导），但安全机制可能导致过度防御，影响正常查询的处理。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于合成临床演示的推理时防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集（涵盖九种模态）来增强模型安全性，并引入混合演示策略以在少量演示预算下平衡安全性和性能。

Result: 实验表明，该防御策略能有效抵御视觉和文本越狱攻击，提升模型安全性，且不显著降低一般性能。增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出的混合演示策略在少量演示预算下实现了安全性与性能的平衡，为Med-VLMs的安全部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑数字化发展中，墙体与窗户的自动分割是提升BIM和CAD效率的关键步骤，需解决语义理解不足和人工干预过多的问题。

Method: SAAF模型通过多模态语义协同特征提取机制（融合文本描述与图像特征）和端到端训练框架，实现文本到分割的自主映射学习。

Result: 在多个立面数据集上，SAAF的mIoU指标优于现有方法，证明其对多样化数据保持高精度分割能力。

Conclusion: SAAF在分割精度与泛化性上取得进展，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入DarkEventInfer和MixVidQA两个新数据集，结合强化学习方法，开发了首个多功能视频理解与推理模型VersaVid-R1，显著提升了视频理解、认知推理和字幕生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图像推理方面取得了进展，但视频推理领域由于缺乏高质量数据和有效训练方法而发展滞后。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DarkEventInfer（要求模型推断被遮蔽的视频事件）和MixVidQA（要求模型从交错视频中分离并推理特定片段）两个数据集，结合强化学习训练VersaVid-R1模型。

Result: VersaVid-R1在多项基准测试中显著优于现有模型，涵盖视频通用理解、认知推理和字幕生成任务。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的数据集和强化学习方法，VersaVid-R1成功扩展了Reason-Then-Respond范式至视频推理领域，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVA-Bench是一个新基准测试，通过解耦14种原子视觉能力（AVAs）来精准评估视觉基础模型（VFMs）的性能，解决了现有评估方法的数据不匹配和多能力混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉基础模型（VFMs）的方法存在两个主要问题：指令调优数据与VQA测试分布不匹配，以及VQA基准测试需要多种视觉能力，难以定位模型的具体缺陷。

Method: 提出AVA-Bench基准测试，明确解耦14种原子视觉能力（AVAs），并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，从而精准评估VFMs的性能。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现使用0.5B参数的LLM与7B参数的LLM在VFM排名上效果相似，但GPU耗时减少8倍。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代视觉基础模型的开发提供了全面且透明的评估基准，使模型选择从经验判断转变为有原则的工程决策。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

TL;DR: BakuFlow：一款半自动标注工具，通过放大镜、数据增强、标签传播和自动标注模块，显著提升计算机视觉数据标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据标注耗时且易错，现有工具仍需人工逐张标注，亟需更高效的半自动解决方案。

Method: 结合可调放大镜（精准修正）、交互式数据增强、跨帧标签传播，并扩展YOLOE框架支持动态类别和视觉提示。

Result: 大幅降低标注工作量，特别适用于视频目标检测与追踪任务，提升工业场景实践效率。

Conclusion: BakuFlow通过多模态交互与自适应算法，为动态数据集提供了灵活可扩展的标注方案。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CAIRe，一种评估图像文化相关性的新指标，用于解决文本到图像模型在跨文化背景下的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的普及，确保其在不同文化背景下的公平性能变得至关重要。然而，跨文化偏见的缓解面临性能下降、事实不准确或冒犯性输出等挑战，且缺乏可靠的测量方法阻碍了进展。

Method: 作者提出了CAIRe，一种基于知识库的评估框架，通过将图像中的实体和概念与文化标签关联，并利用语言模型构建的手工数据集进行验证。

Result: CAIRe在文化显著但罕见的数据集上比基线方法提高了28%的F1分数，并在两个文化通用概念数据集上分别达到0.56和0.66的皮尔逊相关系数，与人类评分高度一致。

Conclusion: CAIRe能够有效评估图像的文化相关性，并在不同图像来源中与人类判断高度一致，为解决跨文化偏见提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模视频生成模型计算量大，难以应用于实时交互场景，需提升效率。

Method: 采用自回归对抗后训练（AAPT），单次神经网络评估生成潜在帧，支持实时流式输出与交互控制。

Result: 8B模型在单H100上实现24fps的736x416分辨率实时生成，8xH100可支持1280x720分辨率长达1分钟。

Conclusion: AAPT通过对抗训练有效提升自回归视频生成效率，支持高质量实时交互应用。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SAGE方法，通过语义增强擦除和全局-局部协作保留机制，解决扩散模型中敏感信息的安全擦除问题，提升安全生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但预训练中可能包含敏感信息，导致不安全内容生成和版权问题。现有方法将不安全概念视为固定词汇反复擦除，导致模型陷入“词汇概念深渊”，无法实现广义概念擦除。

Method: 提出语义增强擦除（SAGE），通过循环自检和自擦除将词汇擦除转化为概念域擦除，并结合全局语义关系对齐与局部预测保留机制，保护无关概念。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在扩散模型的安全生成方面全面优于其他方法，且无需额外预处理数据。

Conclusion: SAGE有效解决了扩散模型中的敏感信息擦除问题，同时保持无关概念的生成能力，为安全生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.
The code and weights will be open-sourced at

TL;DR: ReVisiT是一种简单有效的解码方法，通过引用视觉标记来指导大型视觉语言模型的文本生成，提升视觉基础性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大型视觉语言模型解码策略未能有效利用视觉信息，导致视觉基础不牢固的响应。现有方法通常需要额外训练、多步推理或依赖外部模型。

Method: ReVisiT将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，通过约束差异最小化动态选择最相关的视觉标记，并利用其优化输出分布以更好地结合视觉语义。

Result: 在三个大型视觉语言模型幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升了视觉基础性能，计算开销极小，且计算成本降低高达2倍。

Conclusion: ReVisiT在提升视觉基础性能的同时，减少了计算成本，性能优于或与现有最佳方法相当。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

Result: 在Toyota Smarthome和NTU RGB+D数据集上验证了方法有效性，能提升动作识别性能并扩展少样本数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量合成数据，开源了RANDOM People数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在生成紧密交织的图文输出方面表现不佳，主要由于训练数据规模、质量和指令丰富度不足。

Method: 使用自评估迭代优化（SEIR）方法构建大规模多模态数据集InterSyn，并开发SynJudge自动评估模型。

Result: SEIR显著提升数据集质量，基于InterSyn训练的模型在所有评估指标上均取得提升。

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为下一代多模态系统的发展提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在推理时增强视觉-语言模型组合性的方法，通过分割图像和文本来提升检索性能，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的双编码器视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在组合性方面表现不佳，限制了其检索性能。虽然已有许多训练方法被提出，但推理时技术却鲜有研究。

Method: 在推理时，将图像分割为小块，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），使用VLM找到图像块与文本片段的最佳匹配，最后通过聚合个体相似度计算最终的图像-文本相似度。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了VLM的组合性性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定方面表现突出，且无需任何训练。

Conclusion: 推理时技术具有提升视觉-语言模型组合性的潜力，图像块处理对性能提升至关重要，并指出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

Result: 在NExT-GQA、MSVD-QA和ActivityNet-QA基准上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: 联合生成答案与时间定位能提升性能，弱监督方法有效减少标注需求。

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Motivation: 研究动机是扩展视觉问答任务到基于视频的对话场景，要求模型不仅识别视觉信息，还需结合外部知识和对话上下文进行回答。

Method: 方法包括构建包含2,017个视频和5,986个人工标注对话的数据集，其中对话需要结合视频片段和外部知识。

Result: 结果是一个公开可用的数据集OKCV，包含40,954个对话轮次，并展示了基线模型在该任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 结论指出该任务需要模型同时处理视觉信息和外部知识，并提出了未来研究的挑战。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD^2-Bench是首个针对恶劣天气和复杂场景下自动驾驶的Chain-of-Thought基准测试，包含5.4k高质量标注数据，评估显示当前MLLMs准确率不足60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在恶劣天气和复杂交通环境下对Chain-of-Thought推理过程的严格评估不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建AD^2-Bench基准，覆盖多样恶劣环境数据，提供细粒度标注支持多步推理，并设计专用评估框架。

Result: 在AD^2-Bench上测试的先进MLLMs准确率低于60%，突显基准的难度及提升自动驾驶系统推理能力的必要性。

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench为标准化评估平台，推动自动驾驶中MLLMs推理能力的研究，是重要资源。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

TL;DR: HSENet提出了一种结合双3D视觉编码器和空间压缩器的框架，显著提升了3D医学影像的语言视觉理解能力，在多项任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM模型主要针对2D医学图像，难以捕捉复杂3D解剖结构，导致误诊和幻觉生成。需要开发能有效处理3D医学影像的视觉语言模型。

Method: 采用双3D视觉编码器（全局体积+细粒度解剖）和空间压缩器（基于质心的视觉令牌压缩），通过两阶段预训练实现视觉语义对齐。

Result: 在3D视觉语言检索（R@100提升5.96%）、医学报告生成（BLEU-4提升8.01%）和视觉问答（准确率提升1.99%）中均刷新最佳性能。

Conclusion: HSENet通过混合空间编码机制有效解决了3D医学影像理解难题，为临床决策提供了更精准的AI辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DGAE通过扩散模型增强解码器表达能力，在高压缩比下减少性能损失，同时实现更小的潜在空间和更快的扩散模型收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自编码器在高压缩比下性能下降，且GAN训练不稳定，需提升空间压缩效率并降低潜在空间维度。

Method: 提出DGAE，利用扩散模型引导解码器恢复潜在表示中未完全解码的信息信号。

Result: DGAE在高空间压缩率下有效减少性能损失，潜在空间缩小2倍，在ImageNet-1K图像生成中表现优异。

Conclusion: DGAE通过改进解码器表达能力，实现了高效压缩和快速收敛，为生成模型提供了紧凑的潜在表示。

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Motivation: 尽管以推理为中心的模型在鲁棒性方面有所提升，但其在用户误导输入下的表现尚未充分研究。本文旨在系统评估当前先进推理模型在此类情境下的表现。

Method: 通过三个多模态基准（MMMU、MathVista、CharXiv）评估三种先进推理模型（OpenAI o4-mini、Claude-3.7-Sonnet、Gemini-2.5-Flash），并构建新基准GaslightingBench-R进一步测试模型在误导性提示下的信念保持能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理模型在鲁棒性方面的根本局限，突显了逐步推理与信念持久性之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期诊断面临主观评估和多模态成像成本高的问题，现有深度学习方法能效低且计算需求大，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 提出FasterSNN，整合生物启发的LIF神经元、区域自适应卷积和多尺度脉冲注意力，实现对3D MRI的高效稀疏处理。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FasterSNN表现出竞争性性能，显著提升了效率和稳定性，适用于实际筛查。

Conclusion: FasterSNN为AD筛查提供了一种高效、稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

TL;DR: 研究发现生成式AI在无条件生成中属性偏移较小，但评估框架中的分类器敏感性可能影响偏差检测，需改进标注方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的广泛应用引发了对代表性伤害和歧视性结果的担忧，但无条件生成中偏差产生的机制尚不明确。

Method: 训练无条件图像生成模型，采用常用偏差评估框架分析训练与生成分布间的属性偏移。

Result: 实验显示属性偏移较小，但分类器决策边界在高密度区域时敏感性显著，尤其对连续型属性。

Conclusion: 需改进标注实践，审慎评估框架局限性，并认识社会复杂性对属性偏差评估的影响。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

Motivation: 远程光电容积描记术(rPPG)虽适用于日常健康监测，但在高原等复杂环境下面临光照变化、遮挡和动态姿势的挑战，需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 构建首个长期rPPG数据集LADH，包含21名参与者的240段同步RGB和红外面部视频，结合多任务学习提升生理信号监测性能。

Result: RGB与红外视频融合使心率估计平均绝对误差降至4.99 BPM，多任务学习可同时提升多项生理指标测量精度。

Conclusion: LADH数据集和融合方法显著提高了rPPG在复杂环境下的可靠性，为长期非接触式健康监测提供了新基准。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

TL;DR: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉处理上表现不足，仅使用图像描述的语言模型性能可媲美甚至超越MLLMs。为此，作者提出了一种简单的视觉扰动框架，通过三种扰动策略提升感知鲁棒性，无需修改算法或额外数据，显著提升了数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，仅使用图像描述的语言模型在性能上可媲美甚至超越处理原始视觉输入的MLLMs，表明当前MLLMs在视觉与推理的整合上存在不足。这促使作者探索如何通过视觉扰动提升模型的感知鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种视觉扰动框架，包含三种扰动策略：干扰项拼接、保持主导性的混合和随机旋转。这些策略可无缝集成到现有训练流程（如SFT、DPO、GRPO）中，无需算法修改或额外数据。

Result: 实验表明，视觉扰动显著提升了多数据集上的数学推理性能，效果与算法改进相当。通过视觉扰动训练的Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型在开源7B RL调优模型中表现优异。消融研究揭示了不同扰动策略对视觉推理各维度的独特贡献。

Conclusion: 视觉扰动在多模态数学推理中至关重要：更好的推理始于更好的视觉感知。这一简单框架为提升MLLMs的视觉整合能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过理论分析与实验验证，显著提升了异常检测与定位的对抗鲁棒性，为高可靠性领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign是一种简单有效的校准方法，能够在不依赖特定对齐原因的情况下，提升扩散模型的文本-图像对齐性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Motivation: 传统方法将密集图像对应任务（如宽基线场景和光流估计）分开处理，尽管目标均为图像内容匹配。本文探索统一训练能否在两类任务中超越专用方法。

Method: UFM采用通用Transformer的架构，直接回归(u,v)光流，使用共视像素的统一数据进行训练，相比传统 coarse-to-fine 成本体积方法更易训练且对大位移更准确。

Result: UFM在光流任务上比SOTA方法（Unimatch）准确率提升28%，在宽基线匹配任务上误差降低62%且速度快6.7倍（对比RoMa），首次验证统一训练可跨领域超越专用方法。

Conclusion: UFM为快速通用图像对应提供新方案，并为多模态、长距离和实时对应任务开辟新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Method: 使用自建的10,820张标注应急图像数据集训练YOLOv4-Tiny模型，并通过INT8量化优化模型。与YOLOv5-small进行多指标对比评估。

Result: 量化后模型体积减小71%（6.4MB），推理速度提升44%，mAP等性能指标与基准模型相当。

Conclusion: 量化YOLOv4-Tiny模型非常适合在低功耗边缘设备上实现实时应急目标检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

### [243] [Q-SAM2: Accurate Quantization for Segment Anything Model 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09782)
*Nicola Farronato,Florian Scheidegger,Mattia Rigotti,Cristiano Malossi,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-SAM2提出了一种高效的低比特量化方法，通过线性层校准和量化感知训练，显著提升了SAM2在资源受限场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2在图像和视频分割领域表现优异，但其高计算和内存消耗限制了在资源受限场景的应用。

Method: Q-SAM2引入线性层校准方法优化权重分布，并提出量化感知训练流程，通过裁剪异常值和自适应量化提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，Q-SAM2在保持高精度的同时显著提升效率，尤其在2比特量化下表现优异，mIoU准确率提升达66%。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2不仅适用于量化感知训练，其校准技术在后训练量化中也表现优异，为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaSplat通过动态-静态分离和分层运动建模，扩展高斯泼溅技术以处理动态场景，显著提升重建精度和真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以应对真实世界动态场景的复杂性，DynaSplat旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 结合变形偏移统计与2D运动流一致性分类动静态元素，采用分层运动建模处理全局与局部运动，并引入基于物理的透明度估计。

Result: 在复杂数据集上，DynaSplat在精度和真实感上超越现有技术，且更高效紧凑。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了一种直观、高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用导航智能体OctoNav-R1和基准OctoNav-Bench，支持多模态指令，并通过混合训练范式提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航研究分散在不同任务中，缺乏统一方法。本文旨在开发能处理自由形式多模态指令的通用导航智能体。

Method: 构建OctoNav-Bench基准和TBA-CoT数据集，提出三阶段混合训练范式（HTP），包括SFT、GPRO和在线强化学习。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于现有方法，展示了通用导航的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过结合多模态指令与混合训练，该研究为通用导航智能体发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Wasserstein距离的损失函数，通过匹配字符频率提升手写文本识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写文本识别因字符集随时间、地域变化而具有挑战性，传统模型在特定子集上表现不佳。

Method: 设计新损失函数，利用预测文本与训练数据字符频率分布的Wasserstein距离，惩罚分布差异。

Result: 实验证明该方法能提升模型泛化能力和性能，且无需重新训练即可通过引导解码改进现有模型。

Conclusion: 字符分布对齐有效提升手写文本识别性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、无需标注的几何蒸馏框架，通过注入几何线索提升预训练视觉语言模型对3D空间结构的理解。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需要一种高效方法在不改变架构的情况下增强其几何感知能力。

Method: 通过从现成的3D基础模型蒸馏稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，将几何线索注入预训练模型。

Result: 在3D视觉语言推理和感知基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了3D空间推理能力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为2D训练的视觉语言模型提供了可扩展且高效的3D理解路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成领域领先，但高计算需求限制了其在资源受限设备上的部署，现有PTQ方法难以处理异常值且高压缩需额外变换。

Method: HadaNorm通过特征通道归一化和Hadamard变换，有效抑制异常值，实现更激进的激活量化。

Result: HadaNorm在Transformer块各组件中持续降低量化误差，效率-性能权衡优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为资源受限设备上的扩散模型部署提供了高效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CausalVQA是一个新的视频问答基准数据集，专注于测试模型对现实世界因果关系的理解，填补了现有VQA数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集多关注表面感知或狭窄的模拟环境问题，缺乏对现实世界因果关系的深入探究。CausalVQA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预测、规划和描述）构建数据集，并设计质量控制机制防止模型利用简单捷径。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在CausalVQA上的表现显著低于人类，尤其在预测和假设问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解和替代方案理解方面的不足，为未来研究提供了挑战。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Result: 在多种物体和场景级任务中验证了方法的普适性，支持不同点云模型作为骨干网络。

Conclusion: UniPre3D首次实现了跨尺度和架构的点云统一预训练，为3D视觉表示学习提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in
natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework
trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks
simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing
number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to

First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing

Result: VILASR模型在迷宫导航、静态空间推理等任务中平均提升18.4%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过视觉绘图操作实现的推理范式突破了纯文本方法的限制，为多模态推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Result: 实验证明显式布局控制优于隐式方法，能生成高质量多概念人本视频。

Conclusion: 该框架突破了单实体假设，为复杂交互场景提供了精确的跨模态控制能力。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架有效解决了文本幻觉问题，实现了视觉与文本的双重高质量恢复。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text

TL;DR: 提出CINeMA框架，用于在数据稀缺情况下构建高分辨率、多模态胎儿及新生儿脑图谱，显著提升效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究胎儿和新生儿大脑快速发育需要高时空分辨率的脑图谱，但传统方法依赖大量数据，难以应对病理情况下的数据稀缺问题。

Method: CINeMA通过隐空间操作避免计算密集的图像配准，支持基于孕周、出生年龄及病理特征的灵活条件生成，并实现分钟级图谱构建。

Result: CINeMA在精度、效率和多功能性上超越现有方法，支持组织分割、年龄预测及合成数据生成等下游任务。

Conclusion: CINeMA为脑研究提供了高效工具，代码和图谱已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

TL;DR: Kvasir-VQA-x1是一个新的大规模胃肠道内窥镜视觉问答数据集，旨在通过增加临床复杂性和视觉多样性来推动医学视觉问答领域的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉问答数据集在临床复杂性和视觉多样性方面存在不足，限制了临床决策支持系统的发展。

Method: 使用大型语言模型系统生成159,549个新的问答对，并通过视觉增强模拟常见成像伪影，以测试模型的推理能力和鲁棒性。

Result: Kvasir-VQA-x1数据集支持标准VQA性能和模型鲁棒性评估，为临床环境中的多模态AI系统开发提供了更具挑战性的基准。

Conclusion: Kvasir-VQA-x1通过提供更具临床相关性的数据集，有望加速可靠且有效的多模态AI系统在临床环境中的发展。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MVP基准测试，通过最小变化视频对来减少视觉或文本捷径对视频语言模型评估的影响，提升物理理解的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言模型评估基准存在因视觉或文本捷径导致的分数虚高问题，难以准确评估模型的时空理解和推理能力。

Method: 引入MVP基准测试，包含5.5万个高质量多选题视频QA样本，每个样本配有视觉相似但答案相反的最小变化对，以消除捷径影响。

Result: 人类在MVP上的准确率为92.9%，而最佳开源模型仅达40.2%，随机基准为25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准能有效减少捷径影响，更准确地评估视频语言模型的物理理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

*Shuo Jiang,Min Xie,Jianxi Luo*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的新框架，用于优化设计结构矩阵（DSM）中的元素排序问题，结合网络拓扑和领域知识，显著提升了求解效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂工程系统中，设计结构矩阵（DSM）的优化是一个具有挑战性的组合优化问题。传统数学启发式方法难以捕捉上下文细节，导致求解效果不佳。因此，研究利用LLM的推理和上下文理解能力来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的框架，整合网络拓扑和领域知识，通过迭代优化DSM元素排序来解决组合优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种DSM案例中均能实现更快的收敛速度和更优解质量，且领域知识的引入显著提升了优化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了LLM在解决复杂工程组合优化问题中的潜力，通过结合语义和数学推理，为基于LLM的工程设计优化开辟了新范式。

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or
development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure
Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and
enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging
combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations.
As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate,
traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often
fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective
solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for
advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based
framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for
iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem.
Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves
faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic
and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual
domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of
the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical
reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based
engineering design optimization.

Motivation: 近年来基础模型（如大语言模型）展现出基于知识的推理能力，为工程设计带来新机遇。本文旨在探索如何利用多智能体协作进一步推动智能设计的发展。

Method: 通过历史回顾梳理智能设计的四个演进阶段，并提出ID 4.0的概念框架，重点研究多智能体系统在工程设计自动化中的应用。

Result: 构建了ID 4.0的理论框架，证明其可通过自主多智能体协作实现端到端设计自动化，并指出未来需解决复杂场景、协调机制等关键问题。

Conclusion: ID 4.0为应对复杂设计挑战提供了自适应、自主性更强的解决方案，其发展需结合更优的人机价值对齐与协调机制。

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced
engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent
decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and
interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models
(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general
knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for
further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper
introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by
agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four
distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning
models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of
multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and
discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design
processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems.
Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID
4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design
implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design
goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a
foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity,
autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design
challenges.

Motivation: 探讨AI在需要创造性解决问题的复杂考试中的表现，及其对工程教育和职业的影响。

Result: o3模型在零样本模式下正确解答所有问题，成绩超过所有学生，并达到1985年以来最佳成绩水平。

Conclusion: 机器在传统认为需要高智力的任务中表现出色，这对工程师的工作和未来工程师的教育提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large
language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most
students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this
important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are
rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual
abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The
problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining
principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not
only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,
and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the
students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better
than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the
best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is
a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of
human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the
work of engineers and the education of future engineers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCP的新型对抗文本攻击方法，通过动态生成上下文感知的扰动，提升对抗样本的自然性和攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法多关注词级或局部文本修改，忽略了上下文一致性，导致扰动易被检测或语义不连贯。

Method: DCP利用预训练语言模型动态生成跨句子、段落和文档的上下文感知扰动，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡误导模型和保持文本自然性。

Result: 在多个NLP模型和数据集上的实验表明，DCP能有效挑战先进NLP系统的鲁棒性，生成更隐蔽、更有效的对抗样本。

Conclusion: DCP强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的关键作用，为构建能抵御复杂攻击的鲁棒NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端深度学习在恶意软件检测中表现优异，但依赖虚假相关性（如元数据），缺乏对其影响决策的量化分析。

Method: 通过在小规模平衡数据集上的分析，量化模型对编译器遗留空白空间的依赖，并比较两种端到端模型的适用性。

Result: 研究发现模型过度依赖编译器遗留的空白空间，降低了编译代码的相关性，并提供了两种模型的适用性排名。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对虚假相关性影响的理解，为选择适合生产环境的模型提供了依据。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting
malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations
-- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless
through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks
mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without
quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware
detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the
compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our
seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of
two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in
production.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了在基于深度学习的轨迹生成模型中实施差分隐私（DP）的效用成本，评估了DP-SGD对模型效用的影响，提出了一种新的条件生成DP机制，并比较了不同模型类型在隐私-效用权衡中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置轨迹数据包含敏感信息，差分隐私虽能提供形式化保护，但在保持数据效用方面仍具挑战性。现有生成模型缺乏隐私保证且依赖真实数据，因此需要探索如何在保证隐私的同时维持数据效用。

Method: 1) 评估DP-SGD对生成模型效用的影响；2) 提出一种新的条件生成DP机制并提供形式化保证；3) 分析扩散模型、VAE和GAN在隐私-效用权衡中的表现。

Result: DP-SGD显著影响性能，但大数据集下仍保留部分效用；新DP机制提升了训练稳定性；扩散模型在无隐私保证时表现最佳，而GAN在DP-SGD下表现最优。

Conclusion: DP轨迹生成仍具挑战性，形式化保证目前仅适用于大数据集和受限场景，且非私有最优模型在隐私保护下未必最优。

Abstract: While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal
sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal
protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains
challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to
produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy
guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during
generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such
models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven
utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method
for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.
(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP
mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess
its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN
- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD
significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the
datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training
stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as
GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without
guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best
non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.
In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal
guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained
use cases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TooBadRL框架，首次系统优化深度强化学习中的后门攻击触发器，通过时间、空间和幅度三个关键维度提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击多依赖简单启发式触发器配置，忽视了触发器优化的潜在效果。论文旨在填补这一空白，提升后门攻击的效率和隐蔽性。

Method: 1) 引入性能感知的自适应冻结机制控制注入时机；2) 将维度选择建模为合作博弈，利用Shapley值分析选择关键状态变量；3) 提出基于梯度的对抗方法优化注入幅度。

Result: 在3种主流DRL算法和9个基准任务上的实验表明，TooBadRL显著提高了攻击成功率，同时确保正常任务性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了触发器优化在DRL后门攻击中被低估的重要性，TooBadRL框架为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare,
smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can
efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute
backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns
are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks
rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking
the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we
introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor
Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor
triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.
Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing
mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a
cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most
influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose
a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude
under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms
and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack
success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.
These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of
principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of
TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.

Motivation: 研究间接提示注入攻击对LLMs的安全和隐私影响，填补系统性评估空白。

Method: 采用公开挑战形式，模拟真实场景，收集攻击数据并分析防御策略。

Result: 获得208,095次攻击提交，展示指令与数据分离问题的新见解。

Conclusion: 希望为未来研究提供基础，解决提示注入的实际结构性问题。

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their
inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against
adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have
wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based
applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a
public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants
adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to
trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge
spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval
configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions
from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of
submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new
insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve
as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to
prompt injection.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by
learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on
manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂时空和高维图像重建任务中具有广泛应用潜力，推动了医学影像领域发展。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型作为决策者存在忽视人类原则、导致有害事件的问题，亟需在数据、模型和部署阶段建立系统性公平保障机制。

Method: 采用基于智能体的公平性守护方案（fairness-by-design），构建三层架构的FAIRTOPIA框架，通过多智能体工作流实现全流程动态公平性监督。

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human
supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful
incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily
criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human
principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre),
model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting
the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and
ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric
fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents
learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex
problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the
proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a
fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end
(human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive
and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm
which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision
making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured
over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an
agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on
our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages,
under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research
hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic,
interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

TL;DR: 研究发现学生对AI聊天机器人的信任既包含人际信任也包含技术信任，需建立新的人机信任理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI聊天机器人在教育中的应用日益广泛，但其拟人化特性使学生对其信任机制不明确——是类似对人的信任还是对技术的信任。现有理论模型无法准确描述这种混合信任关系。

Method: 采用偏最小二乘结构方程模型(PLS-SEM)，分析拟人化信任和技术信任如何影响学生的使用意愿、感知有用性等关键因素。

Result: 拟人化信任更强预测信任意愿，技术信任更好预测使用行为和感知有用性，两者对愉悦感影响相似，表明存在独特的人机信任模式。

Conclusion: 需要建立专门的人机信任理论框架，这对教育领域AI的有效应用和教学效果至关重要。

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are
turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the
anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding
whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or
instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of
technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical
challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human
intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed
for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic
systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and
system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived
enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived
usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and
learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,
we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student
perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted
trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral
intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived
enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we
propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots
(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of
trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific
to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately
calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical
impact of AI in education.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外汇汇率预测对全球金融市场至关重要，影响贸易、投资和经济稳定。

Method: 使用2018-2023年USD/BDT历史数据，采用LSTM和GBC模型进行预测和方向性交易测试。

Result: LSTM模型表现优异（RMSE 0.9858），但GBC实盘交易49笔净亏20,653美元。

Conclusion: 深度学习在外汇预测中潜力显著，未来可结合情感分析和实时经济指标提升模型适应性。

Abstract: The prediction of foreign exchange rates, such as the US Dollar (USD) to
Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), plays a pivotal role in global financial markets,
influencing trade, investments, and economic stability. This study leverages
historical USD/BDT exchange rate data from 2018 to 2023, sourced from Yahoo
Finance, to develop advanced machine learning models for accurate forecasting.
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like
ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is
applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial
capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net
loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates
normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and
policymakers robust tools to mitigate risks. Future work could integrate
sentiment analysis and real-time economic indicators to further enhance model
adaptability in volatile markets.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 使用强化学习自动生成高剂量率前列腺近距离治疗计划，减少针数并提升计划质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高剂量率前列腺近距离治疗中，针的放置模式仅依赖医生经验，存在时间消耗大和计划质量不一致的问题。

Method: 训练强化学习代理，逐步调整针的位置和停留时间，以最大化预定义的奖励函数，使用11例患者数据（1例训练，10例测试）。

Result: 强化学习计划与临床计划在前列腺覆盖率和直肠剂量上相似，但显著减少前列腺热点和尿道剂量，且平均少用2根针。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能生成临床实用的治疗计划，质量相当或更优，同时减少针数，具有标准化治疗和改善患者预后的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the
pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We
investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide
needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning
stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan
quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of
one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined
reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent
then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple
rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.
Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for
testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric
metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the
clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical
plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no
statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate
V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans
use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the
first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to
autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.
This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to
conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal
data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial
potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,
and enhance patient outcomes.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决大规模GPU计算中梯度压缩导致的相对不精确性问题，评估优化方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用性能估计方法，分析梯度下降、长步方法和加速方法，并引入半启发式缩短因子改进理论保证。

Result: 实验表明加速方法比预期更鲁棒，缩短因子显著提升了长步方法的性能，所有缩短方法在不精确环境下表现良好。

Conclusion: 缩短方法在不精确环境下具有潜力，加速方法表现出意外的鲁棒性，长步方法通过缩短因子得到显著改进。

Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance
estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods
are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations.
Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using
fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems
on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient
descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first
shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic
shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All
methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two
different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both
accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening
factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened
methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析NHANES数据，结合步态、睡眠活动和深度学习模型，证明体力活动与内脏脂肪组织（VAT）高度相关，进而影响代谢健康风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内脏脂肪组织（VAT）是代谢健康和日常体力活动（PA）的关键指标，过量VAT与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗密切相关。研究旨在探索PA与VAT之间的关系，以评估代谢健康风险。

Method: 研究使用2011-2014年NHANES数据，通过两种方法估计VAT：1）基于步态和睡眠活动的特征工程与岭回归；2）基于24小时连续加速度数据的深度神经网络（Transformer模型）。两种方法均结合了人口统计学和身体测量数据。

Result: 两种方法结合后，VAT估计的相关系数达到r=0.86，表明PA与VAT之间存在强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究证实了PA与VAT的紧密联系，进一步支持PA对降低代谢健康风险的重要性。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Result: 模型在区分顺序和非顺序样本时表现出高分类准确率，证明SNN可用于分类任务和编码机制。

Conclusion: 研究表明CPC与SNN能有效结合，为生物启发的计算模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

Result: 在理想环境和NVIDIA Sionna的实际光线追踪环境中进行的广泛测试表明，GADC表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: GADC方法在多无人机系统的双目标优化中表现出色，具有较高的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

Motivation: SEEG技术用于癫痫评估，但人工检查数百个通道信号耗时且低效，需要一种自动化的方法来识别关键通道。

Method: 使用XGBoost训练分类模型学习发作期通道的判别特征，并利用SHAP评分对通道进行排序，同时引入通道扩展策略以扩大可疑癫痫区域的搜索范围。

Result: 在五名患者的SEEG数据上验证，该方法在准确性、一致性和可解释性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效辅助临床医生识别癫痫发作相关通道，提高SEEG数据分析的自动化水平。

Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant
depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection
of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and
inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful
channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A
classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative
features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their
contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to
expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond
those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were
analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
explainability.

Result: 通过理论推导和全脑钙成像实验，验证了该方法在样本-通道映射不精确的情况下仍能实现准确的信号重建。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂信号结构和实际应用中表现出色，为跨通道无标记感知提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a
multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This
work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie
in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal
structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These
mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as
whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target
tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the
required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more
general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in
whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron
mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings
with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal
reconstruction.

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据集上揭示了有生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench基准测试中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜异质性分析提供了高效的新方法，显著提升了结构解析能力。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

Conclusion: 签名理论与马尔可夫模型的结合为癌症早期检测提供了新思路，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active
secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring
the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer
detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.
in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for
detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our
approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics
of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient
testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the
Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now
recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled
signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address
the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the
extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our
approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the
efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

Conclusion: STREAMINGGS通过优化内存效率，显著提升了3DGS在移动设备上的实时渲染性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on
compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM
traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS
algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and
reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a
memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Result: DGS-LRM在动态重建质量上媲美基于优化的方法，并在真实场景中超越现有预测性动态重建方法。

Conclusion: DGS-LRM通过创新技术解决了动态场景重建的挑战，为3D追踪任务提供了准确且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is
transforming Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), with 6G networks
expected to provide ultra-reliable, low-latency, and high-capacity connectivity

domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey
comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X
communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep

resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security
management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including
computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making
constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X
development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers,
engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered
V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.

TL;DR: UAD方法通过无监督学习从基础模型中提取物体功能知识，无需人工标注，显著提升了机器人对未知物体和任务的泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉功能预测方法依赖人工标注或预定义任务集，限制了机器人在非结构化环境中的操作能力。

Method: UAD利用大型视觉模型和视觉语言模型的互补优势，自动标注大规模数据集，并训练轻量级任务条件解码器。

Result: UAD在仿真环境中训练后，能泛化到真实场景和人类活动，模仿学习策略在10次演示后即可适应新物体和任务。

Conclusion: UAD为机器人提供了无需人工标注的功能理解能力，显著提升了其在开放任务中的操作泛化性。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance

Method: Adv-BMT框架采用双向运动变换器（BMT）进行逆向交通运动预测，分两阶段流程：首先生成对抗性初始化，然后进行逆向运动预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，Adv-BMT生成的碰撞场景质量高，使用增强数据集训练可使碰撞率降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT框架有效解决了自动驾驶测试数据不足的问题，生成的场景多样且真实，显著提升了测试效果。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics
model} outperforms state-of-the-art works. Our project page is available for

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks
across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like
morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body
control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement
learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each
task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and
scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce
SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains
goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends
these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal
task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel,
cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments,
four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks,
accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and
feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid
reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse
loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be
open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page:

Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending
their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications.
Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to
perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts
demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on
relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables
quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging
the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg,
the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its
back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert
policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object
positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert
policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for
coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped
legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding
their role beyond locomotion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的策略方法需要大量时间迭代去噪，且时间变化的动作去噪过程增加了模型训练难度，导致动作准确性不足。

Method: 构建时间统一的速度场，引入动作判别分支提供额外动作判别信息，通过动作感知训练提升去噪精度。

Conclusion: TUDP能高效生成准确动作，适用于广泛的实际任务，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models
to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion
model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs
well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,
the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to
iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic
manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action
denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model
training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions
efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy
(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified
denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in
action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all
timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of
policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose
an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination
branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through
action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern
successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%
on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when
using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement
in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide
range of real-world tasks.

Motivation: 现有故障检测器仅针对特定任务，而VLA策略需在未见任务和场景中检测失败，因此需要通用故障检测方法。

Result: SAFE在模拟和真实环境中测试，相比基线方法实现最优故障检测性能和准确率-检测时间平衡。

Conclusion: SAFE展示了VLA特征空间蕴含跨任务的失败知识，为通用策略提供了高效故障检测方案。

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative
results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

Abstract: Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational
efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce
variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine
learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic
fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts
primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using
heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging
data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better
performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that
predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction
cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success
probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells
that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,
which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the
proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a
heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in
large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

Result: CoA在60个RLBench任务和8个真实世界操作任务中实现了最先进的性能，展示了强大的空间泛化能力和灵活性。

Conclusion: CoA通过反向推理和全局到局部的动作约束，显著提升了视觉运动策略的性能和泛化能力，为复杂任务提供了简单而灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.
