### [1] [Addressing the Challenges of Planning Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14763)
*Prabhu Prakash Kagitha,Andrew Zhu,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用开源模型生成PDDL语言并通过符号求解器验证，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅限于闭源模型或特定流程，研究旨在探索开源模型在PDDL生成中的潜力。

Method: 设计了8种不同的PDDL生成流程，测试了资源密集型包装和语法约束解码等方法。

Result: 发现反馈修正方法使性能提升一倍以上，而直观方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 推理时反馈修正能显著提升开源模型生成PDDL的性能。

Abstract: Using LLMs to generate formal planning languages such as PDDL that invokes
symbolic solvers to deterministically derive plans has been shown to outperform
generating plans directly. While this success has been limited to
closed-sourced models or particular LLM pipelines, we design and evaluate 8
different PDDL generation pipelines with open-source models under 50 billion
parameters previously shown to be incapable of this task. We find that
intuitive approaches such as using a high-resource language wrapper or
constrained decoding with grammar decrease performance, yet inference-time
scaling approaches such as revision with feedback from the solver and plan
validator more than double the performance.

### [2] [Automated Journalistic Questions: A New Method for Extracting 5W1H in French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14804)
*Richard Khoury,Maxence Verhaverbeke,Julie A. Gramaccia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个自动化流程，用于从法语新闻文章中提取5W1H信息，并通过人工标注的语料库验证其性能与GPT-4o相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5W1H问题（谁、什么、何时、何地、为什么、如何）是新闻写作中的核心要素，对摘要、聚类和新闻聚合等任务至关重要。然而，目前缺乏从法语新闻中自动提取这些信息的工具。

Method: 设计了一个自动化提取流程，并创建了一个包含250篇魁北克新闻文章的数据集，由四位人工标注者标记5W1H答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，该流程在5W1H信息提取任务上的表现与大型语言模型GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了法语新闻中5W1H信息的自动化提取，为相关NLP任务提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The 5W1H questions -- who, what, when, where, why and how -- are commonly
used in journalism to ensure that an article describes events clearly and
systematically. Answering them is a crucial prerequisites for tasks such as
summarization, clustering, and news aggregation. In this paper, we design the
first automated extraction pipeline to get 5W1H information from French news
articles. To evaluate the performance of our algo- rithm, we also create a
corpus of 250 Quebec news articles with 5W1H answers marked by four human
annotators. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline performs as well in this
task as the large language model GPT-4o.

### [3] [Scaling Reasoning, Losing Control: Evaluating Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14810)
*Tingchen Fu,Jiawei Gu,Yafu Li,Xiaoye Qu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文引入MathIF基准评估数学推理任务中的指令跟随能力，发现推理能力增强与指令遵循之间存在矛盾，简单干预可部分恢复遵循能力但会牺牲推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在复杂数学问题上表现优异，但其遵循自然语言指令的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在数学推理任务中。

Method: 通过MathIF基准进行实证分析，评估模型在数学推理任务中的指令跟随能力，并测试不同训练方法（如长链思维蒸馏和推理导向强化学习）的影响。

Result: 研究发现，增强推理能力的模型往往难以遵循用户指令，尤其是在生成长度增加时；简单干预可部分恢复指令遵循能力，但会降低推理性能。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型训练范式存在推理能力与指令遵循之间的根本矛盾，需要开发更具指令感知能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive
performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to
natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in
mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent
tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability,
as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user
directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or
trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in
instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases.
Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover
obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings
highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate
the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and
data at https://github.com/TingchenFu/MathIF.

### [4] [Language Mixing in Reasoning Language Models: Patterns, Impact, and Internal Causes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14815)
*Mingyang Wang,Lukas Lange,Heike Adel,Yunpu Ma,Jannik Strötgen,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了推理语言模型中的语言混合现象，揭示了其模式、影响及内部原因，并提出通过约束解码优化多语言推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管观察到推理语言模型在输出中存在语言混合现象并可能影响性能，但其具体影响和内部机制尚未明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究涵盖15种语言、7种任务难度和18个主题领域，通过约束解码强制模型使用特定文字（如拉丁文或汉字）进行推理，并分析模型内部表示与推理轨迹的关系。

Result: 发现语言混合受语言、任务难度和主题共同影响；强制使用特定文字推理可提升准确性；模型内部表示与推理语言选择高度相关。

Conclusion: 语言混合反映了模型的潜在处理偏好，通过控制推理语言可构建更具可解释性和适应性的推理模型，为多语言推理优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) excel at complex tasks by leveraging a
chain-of-thought process to generate structured intermediate steps. However,
language mixing, i.e., reasoning steps containing tokens from languages other
than the prompt, has been observed in their outputs and shown to affect
performance, though its impact remains debated. We present the first systematic
study of language mixing in RLMs, examining its patterns, impact, and internal
causes across 15 languages, 7 task difficulty levels, and 18 subject areas, and
show how all three factors influence language mixing. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the choice of reasoning language significantly affects performance:
forcing models to reason in Latin or Han scripts via constrained decoding
notably improves accuracy. Finally, we show that the script composition of
reasoning traces closely aligns with that of the model's internal
representations, indicating that language mixing reflects latent processing
preferences in RLMs. Our findings provide actionable insights for optimizing
multilingual reasoning and open new directions for controlling reasoning
languages to build more interpretable and adaptable RLMs.

### [5] [WebNovelBench: Placing LLM Novelists on the Web Novel Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14818)
*Leon Lin,Jun Zheng,Haidong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了WebNovelBench，一个用于评估长篇小说生成能力的新基准，通过多维度自动评估方法区分人类作品与LLM生成内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在规模、多样性和客观性上不足，难以有效评估大语言模型的长篇叙事能力。

Method: 基于4000+中文网络小说数据集，采用摘要到故事的生成任务，通过LLM-as-Judge八维度评估框架，结合主成分分析进行排名。

Result: 该基准能有效区分人类杰作、流行网文与LLM生成内容，并对24个前沿LLM的叙事能力进行了排名分析。

Conclusion: WebNovelBench为LLM叙事生成提供了可扩展、可复现的数据驱动评估方法，助力未来研究。

Abstract: Robustly evaluating the long-form storytelling capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, as existing benchmarks often
lack the necessary scale, diversity, or objective measures. To address this, we
introduce WebNovelBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating
long-form novel generation. WebNovelBench leverages a large-scale dataset of
over 4,000 Chinese web novels, framing evaluation as a synopsis-to-story
generation task. We propose a multi-faceted framework encompassing eight
narrative quality dimensions, assessed automatically via an LLM-as-Judge
approach. Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped
to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate
that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written
masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling
abilities and offering insights for future development. This benchmark provides
a scalable, replicable, and data-driven methodology for assessing and advancing
LLM-driven narrative generation.

### [6] [Tracing Multilingual Factual Knowledge Acquisition in Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14824)
*Yihong Liu,Mingyang Wang,Amir Hossein Kargaran,Felicia Körner,Ercong Nie,Barbara Plank,François Yvon,Hinrich Schütze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究追踪了OLMo-7B模型预训练过程中多语言事实记忆和跨语言一致性的演变，发现准确性和一致性随预训练提升，主要由语料中事实频率驱动，同时揭示了跨语言迁移的辅助作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多仅评估最终模型，对预训练过程中多语言事实记忆和跨语言一致性的发展缺乏深入探索。

Method: 以OLMo-7B为案例，追踪预训练各阶段的多语言事实回忆表现，分析频率效应和跨语言迁移机制。

Result: 事实回忆准确性和跨语言一致性随预训练提升；高频事实回忆表现更好；低频非英语事实可通过早期跨语言迁移获得。

Conclusion: 多语言知识获取存在两种路径：主导的语料频率驱动模式，以及次要的、受限于命名实体关系的跨语言迁移模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual
knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate
only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and
crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this
work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during
pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy
and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this
improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining
corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly,
regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages
can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances
largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an
effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We
pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge
acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and
language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and
typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release
our code and data to facilitate further research at
https://github.com/cisnlp/multilingual-fact-tracing.

### [7] [Text Generation Beyond Discrete Token Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14827)
*Yufan Zhuang,Liyuan Liu,Chandan Singh,Jingbo Shang,Jianfeng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoI方法通过保留丢弃的token分布信息，提升自回归生成的文本质量和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归生成中，模型在预测下一个token分布后仅使用采样到的离散token，丢弃了分布中的丰富信息。

Method: 提出Mixture of Inputs (MoI)，在生成token后，将离散token与丢弃的token分布通过贝叶斯估计结合，作为新的输入。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和博士级QA任务中，MoI在多个模型上均提升了性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: MoI通过保留token分布信息，显著提升了自回归生成的性能，计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token
distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution,
passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's
rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method
for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard
paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token
with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a
Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the
sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector
with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows
the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the
generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning
capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA
tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including
QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional
training and negligible computational overhead.

### [8] [SEPS: A Separability Measure for Robust Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14832)
*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Albert No*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SEPS评估框架和混合提示（MP）遗忘方法，解决现有大语言模型选择性遗忘中混合查询场景的失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘指标仅评估模型对独立遗忘查询的响应，而现实场景中遗忘与保留查询常共存于同一提示中，需混合查询评估。

Method: 提出SEPS框架量化模型在单提示中同时遗忘和保留信息的能力；设计MP遗忘策略，将遗忘与保留查询整合为统一训练目标。

Result: 实验表明MP方法显著提升遗忘效果，在单提示含8个混合查询的复杂场景中仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 混合查询评估和训练能有效解决现有遗忘方法的非针对性擦除和过拟合问题，推动实用化机器遗忘技术的发展。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to selectively remove targeted knowledge from Large
Language Models (LLMs), ensuring they forget specified content while retaining
essential information. Existing unlearning metrics assess whether a model
correctly answers retain queries and rejects forget queries, but they fail to
capture real-world scenarios where forget queries rarely appear in isolation.
In fact, forget and retain queries often coexist within the same prompt, making
mixed-query evaluation crucial.
  We introduce SEPS, an evaluation framework that explicitly measures a model's
ability to both forget and retain information within a single prompt. Through
extensive experiments across three benchmarks, we identify two key failure
modes in existing unlearning methods: (1) untargeted unlearning
indiscriminately erases both forget and retain content once a forget query
appears, and (2) targeted unlearning overfits to single-query scenarios,
leading to catastrophic failures when handling multiple queries. To address
these issues, we propose Mixed Prompt (MP) unlearning, a strategy that
integrates both forget and retain queries into a unified training objective.
Our approach significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, demonstrating
robustness even in complex settings with up to eight mixed forget and retain
queries in a single prompt.

### [9] [A Comparative Study of Large Language Models and Human Personality Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14845)
*Wang Jiaqi,Wang bo,Guo fa,Cheng cheng,Yang li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型(LLM)表现出动态、输入驱动的人格特质，与传统人类人格测试工具不兼容，需开发专用框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否具有类人格特质，以及这些特质与人类人格的异同，评估传统人格测评工具的适用性。

Method: 通过三项行为实验：测试重测稳定性(研究1)、跨版本一致性分析(研究2)、角色扮演中特质保留性(研究3)。

Result: LLM人格特质呈现高波动性、输入敏感性、低内部一致性，受提示词和参数设置显著影响。

Conclusion: 提出分布式人格框架，强调LLM人格的流体特性，为构建AI专用人格理论及人机交互提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, becoming active participants in social
and cognitive domains. This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit
personality-like traits and how these traits compare with human personality,
focusing on the applicability of conventional personality assessment tools. A
behavior-based approach was used across three empirical studies. Study 1
examined test-retest stability and found that LLMs show higher variability and
are more input-sensitive than humans, lacking long-term stability. Based on
this, we propose the Distributed Personality Framework, conceptualizing LLM
traits as dynamic and input-driven. Study 2 analyzed cross-variant consistency
in personality measures and found LLMs' responses were highly sensitive to item
wording, showing low internal consistency compared to humans. Study 3 explored
personality retention during role-playing, showing LLM traits are shaped by
prompt and parameter settings. These findings suggest that LLMs express fluid,
externally dependent personality patterns, offering insights for constructing
LLM-specific personality frameworks and advancing human-AI interaction. This
work contributes to responsible AI development and extends the boundaries of
personality psychology in the age of intelligent systems.

### [10] [MAATS: A Multi-Agent Automated Translation System Based on MQM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14848)
*Xi Wang,Jiaqian Hu,Safinah Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAATS是一个多代理自动翻译系统，利用MQM框架进行错误检测和翻译优化，相比传统单代理方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单代理翻译方法依赖自我修正，无法全面捕捉翻译中的多维度错误，MAATS旨在通过多代理分工协作提升翻译质量。

Method: 采用多个专用AI代理分别处理MQM的不同维度（如准确性、流畅性等），并通过合成代理整合标注以迭代优化翻译。

Result: MAATS在多语言对和大型语言模型测试中显著优于零样本和单代理基线，尤其在语义准确性、本地化适应和远距离语言对方面表现突出。

Conclusion: MAATS通过模块化代理与可解释的MQM维度结合，缩小了黑盒LLM与人工翻译流程的差距，提升了语义和上下文保真度。

Abstract: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages
the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal
for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI
agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency,
Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the
annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with
conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
  Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs),
MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically
significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels
particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically
distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in
multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and
context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable
MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human
translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic
and contextual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在为小型语言模型提供一个实用的数学推理评估工具，覆盖从基础算术到代数表达式等多个类别，以填补现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 使用EasyMath基准测试，对23个参数规模从14M到4B的模型进行了零样本测试，包括精确、数值和符号检查。

Abstract: EasyMath is a compact benchmark for practical math reasoning in small
language models. It covers thirteen categories, from basic arithmetic and order
of operations to word problems, algebraic expressions, edge cases, and omits
specialist topics. We tested 23 models (14M to 4B parameters) using exact,
numerical, and symbolic checks on free-form answers in a zero-shot setting.
Accuracy rises with size and training, chain-of-thought adds modest gains, and
consistency improves at scale.

### [12] [Saten: Sparse Augmented Tensor Networks for Post-Training Compression of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14871)
*Ryan Solgi,Kai Zhen,Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan,Nathan Susanj,Athanasios Mouchtaris,Siegfried Kunzmann,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Saten的稀疏增强张量网络框架，用于在微调过程中压缩预训练大型语言模型（LLMs），以提高其在下游任务中的准确性和压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限设备上的高效部署是一个重要问题。由于预训练LLMs的高秩特性以及缺乏预训练数据的访问，现有的低秩张量压缩技术在压缩预训练LLMs方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种稀疏增强张量网络（Saten）框架，该框架在微调过程中对LLMs进行低秩张量化，并实现全模型压缩。

Result: 实验结果表明，Saten在张量化语言模型中提高了准确性和压缩效率，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Saten框架为预训练LLMs的压缩提供了一种有效的方法，能够在资源受限的设备上实现高效部署。

Abstract: The efficient implementation of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Low-rank tensor compression
techniques, such as tensor-train (TT) networks, have been widely studied for
over-parameterized neural networks. However, their applications to compress
pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks (post-training)
remains challenging due to the high-rank nature of pre-trained LLMs and the
lack of access to pretraining data. In this study, we investigate low-rank
tensorized LLMs during fine-tuning and propose sparse augmented tensor networks
(Saten) to enhance their performance. The proposed Saten framework enables full
model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Saten enhances both
accuracy and compression efficiency in tensorized language models, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

*Chin-Jou Li,Eunjung Yeo,Kwanghee Choi,Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro,Masao Someki,Rohan Kumar Das,Zhengjun Yue,Juan Rafael Orozco-Arroyave,Elmar Nöth,David R. Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过语音转换模型生成非英语发音障碍语音数据，提升多语言ASR模型在发音障碍语音识别上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语发音障碍语音数据稀缺，导致自动语音识别（ASR）在该领域表现不佳。

Method: 使用英语发音障碍语音（UASpeech）微调语音转换模型，生成非英语发音障碍语音数据（FLEURS），并用于微调多语言ASR模型MMS。

Result: 在西班牙语、意大利语和泰米尔语数据集上，该方法显著优于现成MMS模型和传统数据增强技术。

Conclusion: 生成的语音数据能有效模拟发音障碍特征，显著提升多语言发音障碍语音识别性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging
due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this,
we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech)
to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it
to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like
speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model,
Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech
recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE
(Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion
significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional
augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and
subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated
speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.

### [14] [Incorporating Token Usage into Prompting Strategy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14880)
*Chris Sypherd,Sergei Petrov,Sonny George,Vaishak Belle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Big-$O_{tok}$框架和Token Cost指标，强调提示策略需平衡性能与token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型的性能高度依赖提示策略，但token使用效率常被忽视，而实际应用中效率至关重要。

Method: 提出理论框架Big-$O_{tok}$分析token增长趋势，并实证测量Token Cost（每单位性能消耗的token数）。

Result: 实验表明，增加token用量会导致性能回报急剧递减，验证了Big-$O_{tok}$的理论分析。

Conclusion: 需采用效率感知的评估方法，平衡性能与token成本以提升实际应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse tasks. However, their task effectiveness is heavily
dependent on the prompting strategy used to elicit output, which can vary
widely in both performance and token usage. While task performance is often
used to determine prompting strategy success, we argue that
efficiency--balancing performance and token usage--can be a more practical
metric for real-world utility. To enable this, we propose Big-$O_{tok}$, a
theoretical framework for describing the token usage growth of prompting
strategies, and analyze Token Cost, an empirical measure of tokens per
performance. We apply these to several common prompting strategies and find
that increased token usage leads to drastically diminishing performance
returns. Our results validate the Big-$O_{tok}$ analyses and reinforce the need
for efficiency-aware evaluations.

### [15] [Strategic Planning and Rationalizing on Trees Make LLMs Better Debaters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14886)
*Danqing Wang,Zhuorui Ye,Xinran Zhao,Fei Fang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreeDebater框架通过两种树结构优化辩论策略，在时间分配和互动性上超越现有多智能体辩论系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性辩论面临时间限制和互动性评估的挑战，需优化辩论策略和效率。

Method: 引入Rehearsal Tree和Debate Flow Tree两种树结构，结合时间预算分配和观众反馈优化辩论。

Result: TreeDebater在辩论策略和时间分配上优于现有系统，更接近人类专家策略。

Conclusion: TreeDebater有效提升辩论效率和策略，适用于竞争性辩论场景。

Abstract: Winning competitive debates requires sophisticated reasoning and argument
skills. There are unique challenges in the competitive debate: (1) The time
constraints force debaters to make strategic choices about which points to
pursue rather than covering all possible arguments; (2) The persuasiveness of
the debate relies on the back-and-forth interaction between arguments, which a
single final game status cannot evaluate. To address these challenges, we
propose TreeDebater, a novel debate framework that excels in competitive
debate. We introduce two tree structures: the Rehearsal Tree and Debate Flow
Tree. The Rehearsal Tree anticipates the attack and defenses to evaluate the
strength of the claim, while the Debate Flow Tree tracks the debate status to
identify the active actions. TreeDebater allocates its time budget among
candidate actions and uses the speech time controller and feedback from the
simulated audience to revise its statement. The human evaluation on both the
stage-level and the debate-level comparison shows that our TreeDebater

TL;DR: 研究通过上下文学习框架提升语音识别模型对陌生口音的适应性，仅需少量样本即可显著降低错误率，但某些方言仍存在识别差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能快速适应陌生口音和语言变体，但当前最先进的语音语言模型是否具备类似能力尚不明确。研究旨在探索模型在语音识别任务中的适应性表现。

Method: 提出一个可扩展的上下文学习框架，在Phi-4多模态模型中插入任务提示和音频-文本对，通过少量样本（如12条语音）进行推理时适应。

Result: 平均词错误率相对降低19.7%，尤其在低资源语言变体中效果显著。当上下文与目标说话者匹配且样本更多时改进最大，但增加样本的边际效益递减。

Conclusion: 该框架展现出与人类相似的适应能力，显著提升了语音识别的鲁棒性，但在某些方言上仍与人类灵活性存在差距。代码和提示已开源。

Abstract: Human listeners readily adjust to unfamiliar speakers and language varieties
through exposure, but do these adaptation benefits extend to state-of-the-art
spoken language models? We introduce a scalable framework that allows for
in-context learning (ICL) in Phi-4 Multimodal using interleaved task prompts
and audio-text pairs, and find that as few as 12 example utterances (~50
seconds) at inference time reduce word error rates by a relative 19.7% (1.2
pp.) on average across diverse English corpora. These improvements are most
pronounced in low-resource varieties, when the context and target speaker
match, and when more examples are provided--though scaling our procedure yields
diminishing marginal returns to context length. Overall, we find that our novel
ICL adaptation scheme (1) reveals a similar performance profile to human
listeners, and (2) demonstrates consistent improvements to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) robustness across diverse speakers and language backgrounds.
While adaptation succeeds broadly, significant gaps remain for certain
varieties, revealing where current models still fall short of human
flexibility. We release our prompts and code on GitHub.

*Jacob X Li,Shreyas S Raman,Jessica Wan,Fahad Samman,Jazlyn Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在状态追踪任务中表现受限，状态空间增大时准确性下降，且状态-动作联合推理能力较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在需要内部状态追踪的任务中的表现，特别是其对确定性状态动态的建模能力。

Method: 在三个领域（Box Tracking、Abstract DFA Sequences、Complex Text Games）评估LLMs的状态预测准确性，并通过激活修补技术识别关键注意力头。

Result: GPT-2 XL在低复杂度设置下达到70%准确率，但状态数超过5或10时降至30%以下；Pythia-1B在状态数>10且转移<30时准确率不足50%。关键注意力头被识别，但状态-动作联合推理能力不足。

Conclusion: LLMs的状态追踪能力源于分布式交互而非显式符号计算，状态-动作联合推理是其薄弱环节。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring
internal state tracking, yet their ability to model state transition dynamics
remains poorly understood. We evaluate how well LLMs capture deterministic
state dynamics across 3 domains: Box Tracking, Abstract DFA Sequences, and
Complex Text Games, each formalizable as a finite-state system. Across tasks,
we find that next-state prediction accuracy degrades with increasing
state-space size and sparse transitions. GPT-2 XL reaches about 70% accuracy in
low-complexity settings but drops below 30% when the number of boxes or states
exceeds 5 or 10, respectively. In DFA tasks, Pythia-1B fails to exceed 50%
accuracy when the number of states is > 10 and transitions are < 30. Through
activation patching, we identify attention heads responsible for propagating
state information: GPT-2 XL Layer 22 Head 20, and Pythia-1B Heads at Layers 10,
11, 12, and 14. While these heads successfully move relevant state features,
action information is not reliably routed to the final token, indicating weak
joint state-action reasoning. Our results suggest that state tracking in LLMs
emerges from distributed interactions of next-token heads rather than explicit
symbolic computation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型在概念冲突下的行为，提出概念不一致性分析框架，并通过角色扮演实验揭示模型在时间边界问题上的表现缺陷及改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于用户提示与模型内部概念边界冲突时（如'画一个双角独角兽'），模型应识别定义矛盾还是继续生成内容。作者提出'概念不一致性'框架以系统分析此类现象。

Method: 采用角色扮演场景下的时间边界作为测试案例，提出三个行为指标（弃权率、条件准确率、回答率），通过探测实验分析模型在角色'死亡'后的表现缺陷。

Result: 实验表明：1) 模型无法可靠识别'死亡'状态导致弃权行为失效；2) 角色扮演会扭曲模型的时间表征导致准确率下降。基于此提出了改进模型一致性的方法。

Conclusion: 概念不一致性会导致模型异常行为，未来需优化模型在概念边界冲突下的表现。研究为理解模型行为提供了新视角和量化工具。

Abstract: Consider this prompt "Draw a unicorn with two horns". Should large language
models (LLMs) recognize that a unicorn has only one horn by definition and ask
users for clarifications, or proceed to generate something anyway? We introduce
concept incongruence to capture such phenomena where concept boundaries clash
with each other, either in user prompts or in model representations, often
leading to under-specified or mis-specified behaviors. In this work, we take
the first step towards defining and analyzing model behavior under concept
incongruence. Focusing on temporal boundaries in the Role-Play setting, we
propose three behavioral metrics--abstention rate, conditional accuracy, and
answer rate--to quantify model behavior under incongruence due to the role's
death. We show that models fail to abstain after death and suffer from an
accuracy drop compared to the Non-Role-Play setting. Through probing
experiments, we identify two main causes: (i) unreliable encoding of the
"death" state across different years, leading to unsatisfactory abstention
behavior, and (ii) role playing causes shifts in the model's temporal
representations, resulting in accuracy drops. We leverage these insights to
improve consistency in the model's abstention and answer behaviors. Our
findings suggest that concept incongruence leads to unexpected model behaviors
and point to future directions on improving model behavior under concept
incongruence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语言模型的信息提取技术TeleSEE，用于从电信领域提取结构化实体，提高了准确性和处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在6G网络中，知识理解是推动网络智能和AI原生架构的基础。信息提取在这一过程中扮演关键角色，能将碎片化的电信知识转化为结构化格式，帮助AI模型更好地理解网络术语。

Method: TeleSEE采用了一种高效的标记表示方法来预测实体类型和属性键，以减少输出标记数量并提高准确性。同时，该方法引入了分层并行解码策略，优化了标准的编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 实验表明，TeleSEE在准确性上优于其他基线技术，且样本处理速度提高了5至9倍。此外，作者还构建了一个名为6GTech的数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: TeleSEE在电信领域的信息提取任务中表现出色，不仅提高了准确性，还显著提升了处理效率，为6G网络的知识理解提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to
advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this
paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming
fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse
AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a
novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract
structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured
entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation
method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of
output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a
hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder
architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into
entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the
proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named
6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related
technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE
method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also
presents 5 to 9 times higher sample processing speed.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出增强版ConspEmoLLM-v2模型，通过扩充数据集ConDID-v2（包含LLM重写的情感伪装阴谋论文本），提升对情感修饰后阴谋论内容的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阴谋论检测模型依赖人类文本的情感特征，易被LLM生成的情感伪装内容绕过。需开发能识别LLM改写文本的鲁棒检测方法。

Method: 构建ConDID-v2数据集（含原始人类推文和LLM情感改写版本），基于该数据集训练ConspEmoLLM-v2模型，结合人工与LLM评估数据质量。

Result: ConspEmoLLM-v2在原始文本上保持原模型性能，在情感改写文本上的检测准确率显著优于ConspEmoLLM及其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过融合LLM生成的情感伪装样本进行训练，可有效提升阴谋论检测模型对内容修饰的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also
cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including
conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories
by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their
typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several
studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are
usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from
LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including
the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional
features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised
content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an
augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which
supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM
to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the
rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We
subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of
ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or
exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content
in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other
baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The
project will be available at https://github.com/lzw108/ConspEmoLLM.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个评估大语言模型（LLM）在二元文本分类中一致性的框架，并通过金融新闻情感分类案例验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大语言模型在文本分类任务中可靠性的标准方法，因此需要开发一个系统性的评估框架。

Method: 研究采用心理测量学原理，确定了样本量要求，开发了无效响应指标，并评估了模型内部和相互间的一致性。案例研究涵盖了14种LLM模型，每种模型对1,350篇文章进行了五次重复分类。

Result: 模型表现出高度的内部一致性（90-98%的样本完全一致），且经济型模型与昂贵模型表现相近。在金融新闻情感分类任务中，小模型如gemma3:1B表现优于大模型，但所有模型在预测实际市场变动时表现随机。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM选择、样本量规划和可靠性评估提供了系统指导，帮助组织优化分类任务的资源分配。

Abstract: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large
language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of
established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles,
we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses,
and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines
financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including
claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and
command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models
demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on
90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical
models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels,
models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models
like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger
counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market
movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our
framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning,
and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for
classification tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TLDM基准测试，评估大语言模型在超长上下文（超过128k tokens）中的理解能力，发现现有模型在超过64k tokens后理解能力下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的上下文长度已扩展至百万tokens，但现有评估方法（如“大海捞针”）难以有效衡量其在复杂长文本中的真实表现。小说因其微妙结构、长程语义依赖（常超128k tokens）成为理想测试案例。

Method: 基于计算小说分析研究，作者发布TLDM基准测试，要求模型完成情节摘要、故事世界配置和叙事时间推算三项任务，测试7种前沿大语言模型的长文本理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，所有测试模型在超过64k tokens后均无法保持稳定理解。结果提示需开发超越传统“中间丢失”评估的复杂长上下文测试方法。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在超长复杂文本中的理解能力仍有限。作者开源TLDM基准（含代码与数据）以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to
millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack
approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of
subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over
128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we
release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's
ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative
time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable
understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers
must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model
performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we
release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在临床决策支持中的评估方法存在局限性，无法真实反映其处理复杂、碎片化医疗信息的能力。

Method: 开发了包含1000多个人工编写问题的MedBrowseComp基准测试，模拟需要综合多源医疗信息的临床场景。

Result: 前沿代理系统在测试中表现低至10%，揭示了当前模型能力与临床需求之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: MedBrowseComp为可靠的医疗信息检索提供了明确测试标准，并为未来模型改进设定了具体目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support
tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating
heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents,
and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often
rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or
conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility
unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that
systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize
multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases.
MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror
clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting
information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to
frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent,
exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded
in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for
reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model
and toolchain upgrades. You can visit our project page at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DECASTE框架，用于检测和评估大型语言模型中的种姓偏见，揭示了模型对印度边缘种姓群体的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但它们仍可能反映和强化社会偏见，尤其是针对印度边缘种姓群体（如达利特和首陀罗）的种姓偏见。这一问题的研究尚不充分，因此需要开发新的方法来检测和评估这些偏见。

Method: 论文提出了DECASTE框架，通过四个维度（社会文化、经济、教育和政治）评估种姓公平性，并采用定制化的提示策略对多个先进的大型语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 研究发现，这些模型系统性强化了种姓偏见，边缘种姓群体（如达利特和首陀罗）与主导种姓群体之间存在显著差异，反映了模型输出中持续存在的社会偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型语言模型中微妙但普遍的种姓偏见，强调需要更全面和包容的偏见评估方法，以评估在现实世界中部署此类模型的潜在风险。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across
diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been
shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based
on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the
reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized
caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by
proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and
assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates
caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational,
and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By
benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models
systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in
the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias
scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant
caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs.
These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and
emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation
methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in
real-world contexts.

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在全球应用中（如旅游助手）的文化适应性不足，缺乏对文化规范违反的评估，可能导致符号性伤害。

Method: 论文设计了CROSS基准，包含多语言视觉查询，并提出CROSS-Eval框架评估文化意识、规范教育、合规性和帮助性四个维度。

Result: 评估21个领先模型显示，最佳模型的文化意识仅61.79%，合规性37.73%。开源模型表现接近GPT-4o但仍不及专有模型。

Conclusion: 通过监督微调和偏好调优方法显著提升了模型的文化安全性能，同时保留了多模态通用能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in globally
distributed applications, such as tourism assistants, yet their ability to
produce culturally appropriate responses remains underexplored. Existing
multimodal safety benchmarks primarily focus on physical safety and overlook
violations rooted in cultural norms, which can result in symbolic harm. To
address this gap, we introduce CROSS, a benchmark designed to assess the
cultural safety reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. CROSS includes 1,284
multilingual visually grounded queries from 16 countries, three everyday
domains, and 14 languages, where cultural norm violations emerge only when
images are interpreted in context. We propose CROSS-Eval, an intercultural
theory-based framework that measures four key dimensions: cultural awareness,
norm education, compliance, and helpfulness. Using this framework, we evaluate
21 leading LVLMs, including mixture-of-experts models and reasoning models.
Results reveal significant cultural safety gaps: the best-performing model
achieves only 61.79% in awareness and 37.73% in compliance. While some
open-source models reach GPT-4o-level performance, they still fall notably
short of proprietary models. Our results further show that increasing reasoning
capacity improves cultural alignment but does not fully resolve the issue. To
improve model performance, we develop two enhancement strategies: supervised
fine-tuning with culturally grounded, open-ended data and preference tuning
with contrastive response pairs that highlight safe versus unsafe behaviors.
These methods substantially improve GPT-4o's cultural awareness (+60.14%) and
compliance (+55.2%), while preserving general multimodal capabilities with
minimal performance reduction on general multimodal understanding benchmarks.

Result: 在NQ-Tables数据集上，CRAFT的检索性能优于当前最先进的稀疏、稠密及混合检索方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过级联检索和增强表格表示，有效提升了表格问答的检索效果。

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a
large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval
models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for
large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new
datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In
this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that
first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables
before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural
re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further
enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using
Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models
(LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate
$\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.

Abstract: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different
languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans
code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and
domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive
language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold
more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we
improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We
coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon.
As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ
culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social
behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using
chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even
better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that
semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we
hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in
corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific
"expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple
methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge
present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our
results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement
of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of
language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and
linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge.
Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging,
particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and
high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address
these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach
adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching
(DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction
in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an
Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given
query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction
based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference,
Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation,
substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple
information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SELF-MAS是一个自监督、仅推理时间的多智能体系统框架，通过元级设计动态生成和优化配置，无需验证集，显著提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统依赖人工设计的角色和通信协议，难以适应新任务或发挥大语言模型的潜力。自动设计方法虽尝试改进，但仍需验证集调优且缺乏推理时适应性。

Method: 提出SELF-MAS框架，通过元级设计迭代生成、评估和优化针对每个问题实例的MAS配置，支持动态智能体组合和问题分解，无需验证集。

Result: 在数学、研究生级QA和软件工程基准测试中，SELF-MAS平均准确率比最强基线提高7.44%，同时保持成本效益。

Conclusion: 元级自监督设计为创建高效、自适应的多智能体系统提供了可行路径，展现了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) leveraging the impressive capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential for tackling complex tasks.
However, most current MAS depend on manually designed agent roles and
communication protocols. These manual designs often fail to align with the
underlying LLMs' strengths and struggle to adapt to novel tasks. Recent
automatic MAS approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations but typically
necessitate a validation-set for tuning and yield static MAS designs lacking
adaptability during inference. We introduce SELF-MAS, the first
self-supervised, inference-time only framework for automatic MAS design.
SELF-MAS employs meta-level design to iteratively generate, evaluate, and
refine MAS configurations tailored to each problem instance, without requiring
a validation set. Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem
decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness.
Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering
benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying
sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS
baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next
strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency. These findings underscore
the promise of meta-level self-supervised design for creating effective and
adaptive MAS.

TL;DR: 论文提出Spoken-MQA基准，评估语音模型在数学推理上的表现，发现当前模型在直接算术和口语化数学表达理解上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但在口语输入的数学推理能力上研究不足，尤其是逐步逻辑推理。

Method: 引入Spoken-MQA基准，涵盖多种数学问题类型，测试级联模型和端到端语音LLMs的性能。

Result: 语音LLMs在基础算术的上下文推理中表现尚可，但在直接算术、口语化数学表达理解及数学知识推理上显著不足。

Conclusion: 当前语音LLMs在数学推理尤其是口语化表达处理上存在明显局限，需进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However,
their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains
underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual
speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight
into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical
problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question
Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models
(ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of
math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual
reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in
unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find
that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning
tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic
problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical
expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized
mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities
are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

*Furong Jia,David Sontag,Monica Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨开源大语言模型如何从大规模语料中学习临床信息，聚焦临床术语理解和无依据医学主张的响应，发现预训练数据与实际临床使用存在不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型未直接针对电子健康记录数据训练，但在临床自然语言处理任务中表现优异。本研究旨在探索模型如何通过预训练语料学习临床信息，特别是临床术语理解和无依据医学主张的响应。

Method: 研究通过两个关键视角分析：(1) 模型对临床术语的理解能力，使用新数据集MedLingo评估；(2) 模型对无依据医学主张的响应。同时分析预训练语料中相关信息的频率、数据组成与模型输出的关系，以及数据来源。

Result: 研究发现临床术语在预训练语料中的出现频率与模型性能相关，但许多临床常用术语在预训练语料中罕见。此外，模型可能复述有争议的医学主张。研究还对临床术语和无依据主张的在线来源进行了分类分析。

Conclusion: 预训练数据与实际临床需求存在不匹配，未来数据集构建需考虑临床术语和无依据主张的来源，以提升模型在医疗领域的适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical
natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on
electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular
open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through
two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical
jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and
(2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we
investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their
corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data
composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate
clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo.
Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across
major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon
frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining
corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage.
Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed
claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed
the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical
claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对AI会议评审中文本与评分一致性的细粒度分析，可能忽略关键细节。

Method: 使用深度学习和NLP会议评审数据，在词、句和方面层面检测对冲语句和方面，分析文本与评分的一致性。

Result: 结果显示文本与评分在所有层面高度一致，回归分析表明高置信度评分与论文拒稿相关。

Conclusion: 研究验证了专家评估和同行评审的公平性，高置信度评分与论文拒稿相关。

Abstract: Peer review is vital in academia for evaluating research quality. Top AI
conferences use reviewer confidence scores to ensure review reliability, but
existing studies lack fine-grained analysis of text-score consistency,
potentially missing key details. This work assesses consistency at word,
sentence, and aspect levels using deep learning and NLP conference review data.
We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze
report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to
evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests
examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high
text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher
confidence scores correlate with paper rejection, validating expert assessments
and peer review fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从大语言模型的隐藏表征中提取线性概念向量时，多样数据引入的噪声会影响导向效果。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（Sparse Autoencoder）去噪隐藏表征，生成更纯净的概念向量。

Result: SDCV方法提升了线性探测和均值差分法的导向成功率，并通过反事实实验验证了噪声假设。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器能有效过滤隐藏表征中的噪声，增强概念向量的导向鲁棒性。

Abstract: Linear Concept Vectors have proven effective for steering large language
models (LLMs). While existing approaches like linear probing and
difference-in-means derive these vectors from LLM hidden representations,
diverse data introduces noises (i.e., irrelevant features) that challenge
steering robustness. To address this, we propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised
Concept Vectors (SDCV), which uses Sparse Autoencoders to filter out noisy
features from hidden representations. When applied to linear probing and
difference-in-means, our method improves their steering success rates. We
validate our noise hypothesis through counterfactual experiments and feature
visualizations.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用扩散语言模型改进文本嵌入，因其双向注意力机制优于单向注意力的LLM嵌入模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的嵌入模型在通用文本嵌入任务中表现优异，但其单向注意力机制与文本嵌入任务的双向性质不匹配。

Method: 采用扩散语言模型进行文本嵌入，利用其固有的双向架构优势。

Result: 扩散语言嵌入模型在长文档检索、推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索中分别比LLM模型提升20%、8%和2%，并在传统文本嵌入基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 双向注意力机制对于编码长文本和复杂文本的全局上下文至关重要。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large
scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based
models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval.
However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional
attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the
bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting
diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent
bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs
especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the
diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding
model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval,
2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on
traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional
attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

TL;DR: 提出ChartCards框架和MetaChart数据集，通过结构化图表元数据支持多任务理解，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型(MLLMs)在图表理解任务中需要大量高质量数据进行微调，导致数据收集和训练成本高昂。为解决这一问题，研究旨在开发一种统一框架降低数据需求。

Method: 提出ChartCards框架，系统合成图表数据表、可视化代码、视觉元素和多维语义描述，构建结构化元数据。基于此创建大规模数据集MetaChart（含10,862数据表、85K图表和170K标注）。

Result: 在6个模型上微调后，平均任务性能提升5%，其中文本-图表检索和图表-表格转换任务提升显著（Long-CLIP和Llama 3.2-11B分别提升17%和28%）。

Conclusion: ChartCards通过统一元数据生成有效支持多任务图表理解，MetaChart数据集验证了其高质量和实用性，显著降低模型训练成本。

Abstract: The emergence of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) presents new
opportunities for chart understanding. However, due to the fine-grained nature
of these tasks, applying MLLMs typically requires large, high-quality datasets
for task-specific fine-tuning, leading to high data collection and training
costs. To address this, we propose ChartCards, a unified chart-metadata
generation framework for multi-task chart understanding. ChartCards
systematically synthesizes various chart information, including data tables,
visualization code, visual elements, and multi-dimensional semantic captions.
By structuring this information into organized metadata, ChartCards enables a
single chart to support multiple downstream tasks, such as text-to-chart
retrieval, chart summarization, chart-to-table conversion, chart description,
and chart question answering. Using ChartCards, we further construct MetaChart,
a large-scale high-quality dataset containing 10,862 data tables, 85K charts,
and 170 K high-quality chart captions. We validate the dataset through
qualitative crowdsourcing evaluations and quantitative fine-tuning experiments
across various chart understanding tasks. Fine-tuning six different models on
MetaChart resulted in an average performance improvement of 5% across all
tasks. The most notable improvements are seen in text-to-chart retrieval and
chart-to-table tasks, with Long-CLIP and Llama 3.2-11B achieving improvements
of 17% and 28%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语言模型生成支持与反驳理由的自动化事实核查方法，显著提升了事实核查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动化事实核查方法主要依赖语言模型的内部知识或微调证据片段，但前者易产生幻觉，后者效果不佳。事实核查过程复杂，证据间常相互矛盾，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 利用语言模型的蕴含和生成能力，生成支持或反驳声明的理由，并基于这些理由训练语言模型。同时系统比较了不同提示和微调策略。

Result: 使用原始证据句子训练模型在RAW-FC数据集上比基线提升8.20%；使用提示的声明-证据理解训练提升16.39%；使用蕴含理由训练在LIAR-RAW和RAW-FC数据集上分别提升28.57%和44.26%。

Conclusion: 通过生成支持与反驳理由的方法显著提升了事实核查的准确性，为自动化事实核查提供了新的有效策略。

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. To verify a
claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying
on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with
evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later
have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that
fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through
multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence
pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more
complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on
entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce
''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a
claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved
superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different
prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the
literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw
evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the
best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training
language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered
an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same
dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3)
outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for
LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to
reproduce the results.

Method: 使用自动化化学信息学工具构建识别任务，并通过专家标注和验证来整理编辑和生成任务。

Result: 最强模型在识别和编辑任务上准确率分别为79.2%和78.5%，在生成任务上仅为29.0%，表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统在分子任务中表现有限，MolLangBench有望推动更有效的化学AI系统研究。

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential
prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks.
We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular
structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality,
unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks
using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks
through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the
evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular
representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular
graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations:
the strongest model (o3) achieves $79.2\%$ and $78.5\%$ accuracy on recognition
and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even
worse on the generation task, reaching only $29.0\%$ accuracy. These results
highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary
molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will
catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for
chemical applications.

Result: 分析表明当前基准测试存在显著缺陷，PSN-IRT能构建更小但更符合人类偏好的基准。

Conclusion: PSN-IRT框架能有效提升大语言模型评估的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread,
yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among
top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic
model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark
effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results
from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable
estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we
propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced
Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters
within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive
analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement
quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging
PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger
alignment with human preference.

TL;DR: Self-GIVE通过强化学习增强LLMs的自动联想思维，解决了GIVE在效率、通用性和准确性上的限制，显著提升了小模型在生物医学QA任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GIVE在解决科学问题时依赖知识图谱进行结构化知识外推，但存在效率低、通用性差和知识不准确的问题。

Method: 提出Self-GIVE框架，结合检索和强化学习，自动提取结构化信息和实体集，帮助模型关联查询概念。

Result: 在生物医学QA任务中，Self-GIVE使Qwen2.5 3B和7B模型的性能分别提升至71.4%和90.5%，且7B模型性能媲美GPT3.5 turbo，同时减少90%以上的token使用。

Conclusion: Self-GIVE有效提升了结构化检索与联想思维推理的可扩展集成，为小模型在复杂任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often
associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For
instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate
"hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and
insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models
(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving
scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not
directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)
addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured
knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many
hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose
Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic
associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts
structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the
queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls
and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on
smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate
knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE
with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B
models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and
$\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging
biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or
outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%.
Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and
reasoning with associative thinking.

Motivation: 现有自动化事实核查方案主要集中于英语，而全球超过2亿乌尔都语使用者缺乏可靠的事实核查工具。大语言模型输出的事实可靠性问题在低资源语言中尤为突出，亟需专门解决方案。

Method: 开发UrduFactCheck框架，采用动态多策略证据检索管道（结合单语和翻译增强方法），创建并开源两个人工标注基准数据集UrduFactBench（声明验证）和UrduFactQA（评估LLM事实性）。

Result: 实验证明翻译增强版UrduFactCheck在多项指标上持续超越基线方法。对12种SOTA大语言模型的评估显示，专有模型与开源模型在乌尔都语事实问答上存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了乌尔都语事实核查的技术空白，开源框架和数据集为低资源语言的可信AI发展提供了重要资源，揭示了当前LLMs在多语言事实性方面的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns
regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource
languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions
overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million
Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first
comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu.
Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that
combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity
of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated
benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating
LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck,
particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms
baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further
benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in
Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小型语言模型在有限资源下，能否为PTSD患者提供具有创伤敏感性的共情对话支持，以补充而非替代专业心理健康服务。

Method: 构建含10,000组对话的TIDE数据集（基于三要素共情模型），由PTSD专家审核；对8个小模型进行微调，并与前沿模型对比，结合人工评估和自动指标分析。

Result: 微调普遍提升共情感知，但增益受场景/用户差异影响；小模型存在共情天花板；不同人群对回应风格有偏好（如年长者重视痛苦确认，高学历者偏好细腻回答）。

Conclusion: 需开发情境和用户感知的系统设计；自动指标存在局限；TIDE数据集的发布为构建安全、资源高效且符合伦理的共情AI奠定基础。

Abstract: Can small language models with 0.5B to 5B parameters meaningfully engage in
trauma-informed, empathetic dialogue for individuals with PTSD? We address this
question by introducing TIDE, a dataset of 10,000 two-turn dialogues spanning
500 diverse PTSD client personas and grounded in a three-factor empathy model:
emotion recognition, distress normalization, and supportive reflection. All
scenarios and reference responses were reviewed for realism and trauma
sensitivity by a clinical psychologist specializing in PTSD. We evaluate eight
small language models before and after fine-tuning, comparing their outputs to
a frontier model (Claude Sonnet 3.5). Our IRB-approved human evaluation and
automatic metrics show that fine-tuning generally improves perceived empathy,
but gains are highly scenario- and user-dependent, with smaller models facing
an empathy ceiling. Demographic analysis shows older adults value distress
validation and graduate-educated users prefer nuanced replies, while gender
effects are minimal. We highlight the limitations of automatic metrics and the
need for context- and user-aware system design. Our findings, along with the
planned release of TIDE, provide a foundation for building safe,
resource-efficient, and ethically sound empathetic AI to supplement, not
replace, clinical mental health care.

generalization, As a result, selecting an optimal model for translation is
crucial for achieving strong performance on in-domain data, particularly in
scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible or practical. In this paper, we
investigate strategies for selecting the most suitable NMT model for a given
domain using bandit-based algorithms, including Upper Confidence Bound, Linear
UCB, Neural Linear Bandit, and Thompson Sampling. Our method effectively
addresses the resource constraints by facilitating optimal model selection with
high confidence. We evaluate the approach across three African languages and
domains, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in both scenarios where
target data is available and where it is absent.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否基于用户生成内容准确生成中文网络热词定义，提出新方法RESS并发布首个中文网络热词数据集CHEER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文社交媒体中大量用户生成内容为研究网络热词提供了可能，探索大型语言模型是否能基于这些内容生成准确的热词定义。

Method: 提出RESS方法引导大型语言模型理解过程，模拟人类语言学习技能，生成更准确的热词定义。

Result: RESS方法有效，但揭示了模型过度依赖先验知识、推理能力不足及难以识别高质量用户生成内容等共同挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于大型语言模型的定义生成技术未来发展奠定了基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is
giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper,
we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for
these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold
contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet
buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we
propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending
process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the
skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the
strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods
and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while
revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure,
underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality
UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for
future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code
are available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/Buzzword.

TL;DR: DISCO改进GRPO，通过领域感知和难度感知奖励缩放解决多域不平衡数据问题，提升模型泛化能力和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在多域不平衡数据中优化不均衡，忽视弱势领域，导致泛化性和公平性差。

Method: 提出DISCO，结合领域感知奖励缩放和难度感知奖励缩放，平衡优化各领域。

Result: DISCO在Qwen3模型上性能提升5%，在多域对齐基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: DISCO有效解决多域数据不平衡问题，提升模型性能与公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences
through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its
simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned
value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution
and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in
real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO
disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented
ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose
Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled
extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key
innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by
reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward
scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize
uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies
promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that
DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on
Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文引入KnowRecall和VisRecall两个新基准，评估多模态大语言模型在多语言和文化知识一致性上的表现，发现现有模型仍存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在实际应用中快速发展，但在多语言和文化知识一致性方面仍面临挑战，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出KnowRecall（15种语言的视觉问答基准）和VisRecall（9种语言的视觉记忆基准），测试模型在文化和视觉知识上的跨语言一致性。

Result: 实验表明，包括专有模型在内的先进MLLMs在跨语言一致性上表现不佳，尤其在文化相关问题上。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多语言和文化感知能力上仍有局限，需开发更鲁棒的方法以实现真正的多语言和文化适应性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标注多跳问答数据集成本高，现有合成方法生成的问题过于简单或需要大量人工指导。

Method: HopWeaver通过识别跨文档的互补信息，自动合成桥接和比较两类多跳问题，构建真实的推理路径。

Result: 合成的问题质量与人工标注数据集相当或更优，且成本更低。

Conclusion: HopWeaver在标注资源稀缺的专业领域具有重要价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) is crucial for evaluating the model's
capability to integrate information from diverse sources. However, creating
extensive and high-quality MHQA datasets is challenging: (i) manual annotation
is expensive, and (ii) current synthesis methods often produce simplistic
questions or require extensive manual guidance. This paper introduces
HopWeaver, the first automatic framework synthesizing authentic multi-hop
questions from unstructured text corpora without human intervention. HopWeaver
synthesizes two types of multi-hop questions (bridge and comparison) using an
innovative approach that identifies complementary documents across corpora. Its
coherent pipeline constructs authentic reasoning paths that integrate
information across multiple documents, ensuring synthesized questions
necessitate authentic multi-hop reasoning. We further present a comprehensive
system for evaluating synthesized multi-hop questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the synthesized questions achieve comparable or superior
quality to human-annotated datasets at a lower cost. Our approach is valuable
for developing MHQA datasets in specialized domains with scarce annotated
resources. The code for HopWeaver is publicly available.

Method: 提出DeFT-X方法，使用奇异值分解对预训练模型权重矩阵去噪，再进行基于幅度的稀疏修剪，生成更鲁棒的稀疏微调向量。

Result: 在情感分类(NusaX)和自然语言推理(AmericasNLI)任务上，DeFT-X表现与稀疏微调方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: DeFT-X通过去噪和稀疏微调的组合，有效提升了跨语言迁移在低资源语言任务上的性能。

Abstract: Effective cross-lingual transfer remains a critical challenge in scaling the
benefits of large language models from high-resource to low-resource languages.
Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task
knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and
language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One
notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual
transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select
a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned.
These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the
pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a
target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These
sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning.
In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises
the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using
singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs. We evaluate
DeFT-X on a diverse set of extremely low-resource languages for sentiment
classification (NusaX) and natural language inference (AmericasNLI) and
demonstrate that it performs at par or outperforms SFT and other prominent
cross-lingual transfer baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual
understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across
diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks
primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity
of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive
benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding
capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning
biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating
diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and
unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies:
Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection,
Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a
variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of
state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their
strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering
valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺因表面与隐含情感的不一致而成为情感分析的挑战，尤其在涉及特定国家或地区时更为复杂。论文旨在利用PMP技术解决这一问题，并生成可解释的讽刺检测结果。

Method: 使用PMP技术对澳大利亚和印度英语数据集BESSTIE进行手动讽刺标注，并与标准英语数据集FLUTE进行比较，评估了两种开放权重大语言模型（GEMMA和LLAMA）的性能。

Result: 在所有任务和数据集上，PMP方法相比其他四种提示策略均取得了统计显著的性能提升，且代理提示等技术通过外部知识检索缓解了上下文相关的问题。

Conclusion: PMP技术在生成不同英语变体的讽刺解释方面具有显著优势，为讽刺检测提供了可解释且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a challenge to sentiment analysis because of the incongruity
between stated and implied sentiment. The challenge is exacerbated when the
implication may be relevant to a specific country or geographical region.
Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that
has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for
explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a
benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to
an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called
BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them
with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our
approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA)
achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and
datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find
that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related
failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval. The focused contribution of
our work is utilising PMP in generating sarcasm explanations for varieties of
English.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管状态空间模型(SSMs)在语言建模中展现出高效和性能优势，但在从上下文中回忆基本信息时表现不稳定。论文旨在揭示不同架构在机制层面的成功与失败原因。

Method: 通过在AR任务上的实验，使用因果干预分析不同模型的表现机制，并引入基于PCFG归纳的合成任务ATR来扩展研究。

Result: 发现只有Transformers和Based SSM模型能完全成功完成AR任务，Mamba紧随其后，而其他SSMs（如H3、Hyena）失败。机制分析显示，成功模型通过归纳头存储键值关联，而SSMs仅在最后状态计算这些关联。ATR任务验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使准确率相近的架构在机制上也可能存在实质性差异，强调了采用机制评估的重要性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and
performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable
performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance
on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency,
behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic
level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we
conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models
fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3,
Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that
Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using
induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the
last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution
component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative
Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR
introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find
that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the
same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures
with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the
adoption of mechanistic evaluations.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的文档检索方法在复杂多跳问答任务中表现不佳，主要由于全局奖励信号稀疏。

Method: 提出StepSearch框架，采用逐步近端策略优化方法，结合信息增益和冗余惩罚的细粒度搜索奖励机制。

Result: 在标准多跳问答基准测试中，3B和7B模型分别取得11.2%和4.2%的绝对提升，仅使用19k训练数据。

Conclusion: 细粒度逐步监督能有效优化深度搜索大语言模型，StepSearch框架具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based
agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based
document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but
underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from
global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce
StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal
policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed
intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on
information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We
constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing
sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a
set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it
significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2%
absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL
baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our
implementation is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和智能虚拟代理作为心理治疗师的普及扩大了心理健康服务的可及性，但其部署也伴随着严重的不良后果，如用户伤害和自杀，主要原因是缺乏能够捕捉治疗互动中微妙风险的标准化评估方法。

Method: 通过迭代过程开发了一种新的风险分类法，包括心理治疗风险文献的回顾、与临床和法律专家的定性访谈，以及与DSM-5等临床标准和现有评估工具的对齐。

Conclusion: 该分类法为AI驱动的心理健康支持领域提供了更安全和更负责任的创新基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual
Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for
expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been
linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide,
facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of
capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation
techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition
and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent
decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for
the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed
through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk
literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and
alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing
assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured
approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a
high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss
potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive
model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe
deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking
of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a
foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in
the domain of AI-driven mental health support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维(Long CoT)在表格推理中训练成本高且存在内容幻觉问题，需要更高效可靠的方法。

Method: RoT通过迭代逐行遍历表格，结合LLM的反思能力进行推理扩展和优化，无需额外训练。

Result: RoT在WikiTableQuestions和TableBench上达到SOTA，平均性能提升4.3%，且推理token更少。

Conclusion: RoT以更低成本实现更高效的表格推理，显著减少幻觉问题，适用于非推理模型。

Abstract: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to
answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language
models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance
reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning.
However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low
reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose
Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal,
allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each
traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging
reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal
encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations.
Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an
average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions
and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT
outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在训练大型语言模型（LLM）用于复杂推理和问题解决方面显示出潜力，但如何优化基于LLM的搜索代理的设计仍不完全清楚。论文旨在系统研究奖励设计、LLM选择和搜索引擎作用等关键因素。

Method: 论文进行了全面的实证研究，系统调查了奖励设计（如格式奖励和中间检索奖励）、LLM的规模和初始化（通用与专用推理模型）以及搜索引擎选择对RL训练和代理性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现：格式奖励能有效提升最终性能，而中间检索奖励影响有限；LLM的规模和初始化显著影响RL结果；搜索引擎的选择对训练动态和推理鲁棒性至关重要。

Conclusion: 论文为实际应用中构建和部署基于LLM的搜索代理提供了重要指导，强调了奖励设计、LLM选择和搜索引擎优化的关键作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training
large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world
problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated
LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use.
While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design
of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such
as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying
LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further
investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to
systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight
several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final
performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the
scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized)
significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a
critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained
agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully
building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code

Motivation: 现有大语言模型过度依赖链式思维推理，导致输出冗长且效率低下，甚至在简单任务上性能下降。

Method: 提出基于置信度的自适应推理（CAR），首先生成简短答案并评估困惑度，仅在模型低置信度时触发长推理。

Result: 实验表明，CAR在多模态VQA/KIE基准和文本推理数据集上均优于纯简短或长推理方法。

Conclusion: CAR框架有效优化了推理效率与准确性的平衡，为大规模语言模型推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened
outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does
not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.
To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel
framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form
reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and
evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low
confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal
VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both
short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance
between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: ReAct在复杂环境中常产生不接地或逻辑混乱的推理步骤，导致代理状态与目标不一致。

Result: ReflAct平均超越ReAct 27.7%，在ALFWorld中达到93.3%的成功率。

Conclusion: 强化核心推理主干是提升代理性能的关键。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like
ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However,
ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to
misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that
this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and
goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this,
we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely
planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative
to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing
goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This
design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7%
on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even
outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM),
showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent
performance.

Method: 提出将EcomScript定义为三个子任务，开发新框架通过动作与购买意图的语义相似性关联产品，构建包含60万脚本的大规模数据集EcomScriptBench。

Result: 实验表明现有LLM在EcomScript任务上表现不佳，即使微调后也面临挑战，而注入产品购买意图能提升性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为电商脚本规划提供了首个大规模基准，证明了产品意图注入的有效性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of
actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for
typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based
assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby
facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this
capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the
inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product
retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies
between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark
data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the
task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks.
We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of
product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the
semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By
applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very
first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229
scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted
to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark.
Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges
with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase
intentions improves their performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出DUSK基准测试，用于评估数据重叠场景下的机器学习遗忘方法，发现现有方法难以选择性删除特定内容而不损害共享信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法评估通常假设遗忘集和保留集完全不相交，忽视了现实中两者内容可能重叠的情况，如新闻文章和维基百科对同一事件的不同描述。

Method: 引入DUSK基准测试，构建描述相同事实但风格不同的文档集，其中部分内容为共享信息，部分为各集独有。通过七项指标评估遗忘方法的选择性删除能力。

Result: 评估九种最新遗忘方法后发现，多数方法仅能删除表层文本，但难以在不损害共享内容的情况下清除深层次、特定上下文的知识。

Conclusion: DUSK基准测试揭示了现有遗忘方法的局限性，为开发更精确、可靠的现实应用遗忘技术提供了支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of copyrighted or
sensitive data. Machine unlearning aims to remove such 'forget' data while
preserving utility and information from the 'retain' set. However, existing
evaluations typically assume that forget and retain sets are fully disjoint,
overlooking realistic scenarios where they share overlapping content. For
instance, a news article may need to be unlearned, even though the same event,
such as an earthquake in Japan, is also described factually on Wikipedia.
Effective unlearning should remove the specific phrasing of the news article
while preserving publicly supported facts. In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a
benchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.
DUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in
different styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and
other content remaining unique to each. When one set is designated for
unlearning, an ideal method should remove its unique content while preserving
shared facts. We define seven evaluation metrics to assess whether unlearning
methods can achieve this selective removal. Our evaluation of nine recent
unlearning methods reveals a key limitation: while most can remove
surface-level text, they often fail to erase deeper, context-specific knowledge
without damaging shared content. We release DUSK as a public benchmark to
support the development of more precise and reliable unlearning techniques for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DP的可信推理框架，通过充分利用知识图谱中的先验知识，结合监督微调和Kahneman-Tversky优化，提升大语言模型的推理忠实度和响应可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用知识图谱中的结构信息和显式/隐式约束，导致大语言模型因知识不足或过时而产生幻觉。

Method: DP框架采用渐进式知识蒸馏策略，将结构先验通过监督微调和Kahneman-Tversky优化融入大语言模型，并结合推理-自省策略进行精细化验证。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，DP实现了最先进的性能，尤其在ComplexWebQuestions数据集上Hit@1提升了13%，并能生成高度可信的响应。

Conclusion: DP框架通过有效利用知识图谱先验，显著提升了大语言模型的推理忠实度和响应可靠性，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or
outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the
prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their
structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can
enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the
reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a
trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which
sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a
progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors
into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky
optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation.
Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which
guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted
constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new
state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the
ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We
also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The
code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在多步推理链中嵌入私有或受版权保护的信息，使得遗忘任务比标准LLMs更具挑战性。

Method: 引入R-TOFU基准，结合梯度优化和偏好优化方法，提出Reasoned IDK以平衡遗忘效果与模型效用。

Result: 传统方法在推理步骤中残留知识，Reasoned IDK在遗忘效果与模型效用间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: R-TOFU为研究LRMs中的遗忘问题提供了系统基础，需在不同解码设置下评估模型。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) embed private or copyrighted information not
only in their final answers but also throughout multi-step chain-of-thought
(CoT) traces, making reliable unlearning far more demanding than in standard
LLMs. We introduce Reasoning-TOFU (R-TOFU), the first benchmark tailored to
this setting. R-TOFU augments existing unlearning tasks with realistic CoT
annotations and provides step-wise metrics that expose residual knowledge
invisible to answer-level checks. Using R-TOFU, we carry out a comprehensive
comparison of gradient-based and preference-optimization baselines and show
that conventional answer-only objectives leave substantial forget traces in
reasoning. We further propose Reasoned IDK, a preference-optimization variant
that preserves coherent yet inconclusive reasoning, achieving a stronger
balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility than earlier refusal
styles. Finally, we identify a failure mode: decoding variants such as
ZeroThink and LessThink can still reveal forgotten content despite seemingly
successful unlearning, emphasizing the need to evaluate models under diverse
decoding settings. Together, the benchmark, analysis, and new baseline
establish a systematic foundation for studying and improving unlearning in LRMs
while preserving their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 大语言模型在文化表达和事实回答上缺乏多样性，需通过激活多文化知识改善。

Method: 提出多语言提示法，通过添加文化语言线索生成多样化回答并整合结果。

Result: 实验证明该方法优于高温采样、逐步回忆等现有技术，效果受语言资源与模型规模影响。

Conclusion: 多语言提示能有效减少文化特异性信息的幻觉，提升模型输出的多样性与准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and
overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering
factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting:
a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with
added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses,
and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have
language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity
by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training
data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA
70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently
outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature
sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show
that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level
and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues
reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

Result: 实验表明GETER达到最先进性能，同时展现优异的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GETER通过融合图结构与文本信息，显著提升了大语言模型的可解释时序推理能力，相关代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal
reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often
neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To
address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range
of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs'
capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings
reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying
solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel
structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text
for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal
knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural
information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix
adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally,
LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token
with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER
achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its
effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/carryTatum/GETER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）被广泛用于评估文本-图像对齐，但其在视觉模态上的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。本文旨在探究对抗性视觉操纵是否能系统性欺骗LVLM评分系统。

Method: 定义了文本到图像（T2I）评估中的潜在图像诱导偏差，并引入了一个细粒度、多领域的元评估基准FRAME，通过注入偏差测试LVLM的脆弱性。

Result: 所有测试的LVLM评委在所有领域均表现出脆弱性，对操纵图像一致给出虚高评分。多重偏差组合会放大效应，且提示缓解策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前LVLM评估系统存在显著视觉偏差漏洞，亟需开发更鲁棒的评估模型。

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have emerged as the preferred
tools for judging text-image alignment, yet their robustness along the visual
modality remains underexplored. This work is the first study to address a key
research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool
LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image
induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these
biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel,
fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is
deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing
the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges
exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for
manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases
amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible.
Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation
strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems
and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.

Conclusion: MentalMAC有效提升心理操控检测能力，相关资源将开源以促进研究。

Abstract: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse
that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the
complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders
the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for
training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's
performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of
real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose
MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs'
ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach
includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on
evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated
multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from
complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000
real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human
annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows
the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs
across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be
released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may

Result: 语言特定消融一致提升多语言推理性能，同时保留顶层语言特征对保持语言保真度至关重要。

Conclusion: 该训练无关的轻量级方法为提升大语言模型跨语言泛化能力提供了可解释策略。

Abstract: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource
languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that
human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we
hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable
components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To
evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific
representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning
11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation
consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses
further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively
decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning
capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential
for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as
supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation
achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead.
These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual
reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for
improving cross-lingual generalization.

Abstract: Existing AI-generated text detection methods heavily depend on large
annotated datasets and external threshold tuning, restricting interpretability,
adaptability, and zero-shot effectiveness. To address these limitations, we
propose AGENT-X, a zero-shot multi-agent framework informed by classical
rhetoric and systemic functional linguistics. Specifically, we organize
detection guidelines into semantic, stylistic, and structural dimensions, each
independently evaluated by specialized linguistic agents that provide explicit
reasoning and robust calibrated confidence via semantic steering. A meta agent
integrates these assessments through confidence-aware aggregation, enabling
threshold-free, interpretable classification. Additionally, an adaptive
Mixture-of-Agent router dynamically selects guidelines based on inferred
textual characteristics. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that
AGENT-X substantially surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and zero-shot
approaches in accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

Motivation: 网页导航需要长期序列决策，现有方法依赖多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为奖励模型，存在部署成本高、速度慢的问题。

Method: 构建大规模数据集WebPRM Collection（含4万步级偏好对和标注清单），并开发首个过程奖励模型Web-Shepherd及评估基准WebRewardBench。

Result: Web-Shepherd在WebRewardBench上比GPT-4o准确率高30分；在WebArena-lite测试中，结合GPT-4o-mini策略模型，性能提升10.9分且成本降低10倍。

Conclusion: Web-Shepherd为网页导航任务提供了高效、低成本的过程奖励模型，其数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Web navigation is a unique domain that can automate many repetitive real-life
tasks and is challenging as it requires long-horizon sequential decision making
beyond typical multimodal large language model (MLLM) tasks. Yet, specialized
reward models for web navigation that can be utilized during both training and
test-time have been absent until now. Despite the importance of speed and
cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which
poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in
this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd
which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level. To achieve
this, we first construct the WebPRM Collection, a large-scale dataset with 40K
step-level preference pairs and annotated checklists spanning diverse domains
and difficulty levels. Next, we also introduce the WebRewardBench, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for evaluating PRMs. In our experiments, we observe
that our Web-Shepherd achieves about 30 points better accuracy compared to
using GPT-4o on WebRewardBench. Furthermore, when testing on WebArena-lite by
using GPT-4o-mini as the policy and Web-Shepherd as the verifier, we achieve
10.9 points better performance, in 10 less cost compared to using GPT-4o-mini
as the verifier. Our model, dataset, and code are publicly available at LINK.

Conclusion: DebackX模型有效解决了复杂场景下的图像内翻译问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate texts within images
from one language to another. Previous research on IIMT was primarily conducted
on simplified scenarios such as images of one-line text with black font in
white backgrounds, which is far from reality and impractical for applications
in the real world. To make IIMT research practically valuable, it is essential
to consider a complex scenario where the text backgrounds are derived from
real-world images. To facilitate research of complex scenario IIMT, we design
an IIMT dataset that includes subtitle text with real-world background. However
previous IIMT models perform inadequately in complex scenarios. To address the
issue, we propose the DebackX model, which separates the background and
text-image from the source image, performs translation on text-image directly,
and fuses the translated text-image with the background, to generate the target
image. Experimental results show that our model achieves improvements in both
translation quality and visual effect.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation
capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and
fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant
challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research
focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been
paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text,
particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations
occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization
as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware
long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon:
hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of
the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential
contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over
long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional
hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding
segments of long outputs.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在改写有毒内容时往往过度礼貌化，导致情感意图失真，而中文的毒性表达常通过表情、谐音等隐晦方式呈现，亟需开发能保留原始情感的去毒方法。

Method: 构建包含1,556个三元组（原句/去毒改写/毒性标注）的中文数据集，覆盖标准表达、表情谐音、单轮/多轮对话五类场景，从去毒准确度、流畅性等四维度评估17种LLM。

Result: 商业模型和MoE架构表现最佳，但所有模型在表情、谐音等隐晦场景中均存在安全性与情感保真的失衡问题，单轮对话任务准确率比多轮对话高15%。

Conclusion: 中文隐晦毒性改写需要更细粒度控制，发布ToxiRewriteCN数据集以支持情感感知的去毒研究，未来需提升模型在上下文敏感场景中的表现。

Abstract: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent
is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online
interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting
toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the
emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in
Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or
discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification
dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset
comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence,
a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five
real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic
toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs,
including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across
four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and
sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform
best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in
more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and
dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on
controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

Conclusion: DPKG框架通过区分和利用双视角关键词，显著提升了多跳问题生成的性能，为该任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-hop question generation (MQG) aims to generate questions that require
synthesizing multiple information snippets from documents to derive target
answers. The primary challenge lies in effectively pinpointing crucial
information snippets related to question-answer (QA) pairs, typically relying
on keywords. However, existing works fail to fully utilize the guiding
potential of keywords and neglect to differentiate the distinct roles of
question-specific and document-specific keywords. To address this, we define
dual-perspective keywords (i.e., question and document keywords) and propose a
Dual-Perspective Keyword-Guided (DPKG) framework, which seamlessly integrates
keywords into the multi-hop question generation process. We argue that question
keywords capture the questioner's intent, whereas document keywords reflect the
content related to the QA pair. Functionally, question and document keywords
work together to pinpoint essential information snippets in the document, with
question keywords required to appear in the generated question. The DPKG
framework consists of an expanded transformer encoder and two answer-aware
transformer decoders for keyword and question generation, respectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, showcasing its
promising performance and underscoring its significant value in the MQG task.

TL;DR: 论文重新定义了情感支持对话任务，提出多策略连续响应模型，实验显示大语言模型在该任务上表现优于监督模型和人类支持者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持对话任务的定义过于简化，忽略了支持者在单轮对话中连续使用多种策略的常见现象。

Method: 通过分析ESConv数据集，重新定义任务为生成策略-话语对序列，并引入监督学习模型和大语言模型进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型在重新定义的任务中表现优于监督模型和人类支持者，能够更全面地提供支持。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在情感支持对话任务中展现出更全面的支持能力，尤其是在提问和提供建议方面表现突出。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy,
validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However,
existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive
responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through
a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet
previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple
strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC
task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires
generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue
history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling
approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language
models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art
LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary
to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and
provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出通过添加结构化前缀（prefilling attack）来改进大语言模型在选择题任务中的首词概率评估方法，显著提升了准确性、校准性和输出一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在选择题任务中广泛使用首词概率（FTP）评估，但该方法存在脆弱性，如高概率分配给无关词（misalignment）或将有效词误用为通用前缀（misinterpretation），影响符号评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出prefilling attack方法，即在模型输出前添加结构化自然语言前缀（如“正确选项是：”），引导模型生成清晰有效的选项，无需修改模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，带前缀的FTP策略显著提高了多种大语言模型和选择题基准测试的准确性、校准性和输出一致性，优于标准FTP，并常与需全解码和外部分类器的开放生成方法性能相当，同时更高效。

Conclusion: prefilling是一种简单、鲁棒且低成本的方法，可增强选择题任务中基于FTP评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice
question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which
selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While
efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated
tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic
preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*),
undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple
solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g.,
"*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored
in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a
clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP
with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and
output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It
outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended
generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers,
while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling
is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of
FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用单元语言解决语音到语音翻译中的跨模态和跨语言挑战，通过多任务学习和任务提示建模提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音到语音翻译（S2ST）面临跨模态特征提取和跨语言长序列对齐两大挑战，需要一种有效的表示格式来克服这些困难。

Method: 提出单元语言作为类文本表示格式，基于n-元语言模型构建，并采用多任务学习和任务提示建模来优化语音建模过程。

Result: 在Voxpupil数据集的四种语言上实验表明，该方法显著优于基线模型，性能接近使用文本训练的模型。

Conclusion: 单元语言结合多任务学习和任务提示建模能有效提升S2ST性能，为无文本语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: The success of building textless speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) models
has attracted much attention. However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1)
extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal
(CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences,
called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two
modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like
representation format, constructed using $n$-gram language modeling. We
implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the
speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying
source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt
modeling to mitigate this conflict. We conduct experiments on four languages of
the Voxpupil dataset. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over a
strong baseline and achieves performance comparable to models trained with
text.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的对比改写攻击方法CoPA，有效欺骗文本检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量数据和计算资源训练专用改写器，且面对先进检测算法时效果下降。

Method: CoPA利用现成LLM生成更人类化的文本，并通过对比机器化词分布消除机器特征。

Result: 实验验证CoPA在各种场景下能有效欺骗文本检测器。

Conclusion: CoPA提供了一种高效且无需训练的攻击方法，能有效绕过文本检测。

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has
driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass
these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these
texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require
substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,
and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection
algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive
\textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that
effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is
to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like
texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can
still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes
that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an
auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like
distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns
from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to
produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical
analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlowKV提出了一种多轮隔离机制，用于优化大语言模型中的KV缓存管理，避免重复压缩历史对话导致的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮对话中，KV缓存的线性增长带来高昂计算成本，且现有压缩策略会因重复压缩早期对话导致信息丢失和上下文遗忘。

Method: FlowKV通过多轮隔离机制，保留历史压缩后的KV缓存，仅对新生成的KV对进行策略性压缩，避免旧上下文被重复压缩。

Result: 实验表明，FlowKV在保持指令跟随准确性和用户偏好保留方面显著优于基线方法，提升幅度从10.90%到75.40%。

Conclusion: FlowKV有效解决了多轮对话中KV缓存管理的瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型性能，尤其在后续对话轮次中表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache
presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with
dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction
strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early
conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting.
This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism}
for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression
method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation
mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns.
Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs
of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of
older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results
demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline
strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference
retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

Motivation: 当前NLP领域的情感分类数据集缺乏标准化、大规模且基于心理学分类的资源，现有数据集存在分类不一致、样本量有限或领域局限的问题。

Method: 通过整合多样化的文本来源，并基于Shaver经验验证的情感分类法，构建了一个统一的情感数据集框架。

Motivation: 为了深入理解语言模型在KL散度度量下的行为，研究团队旨在探索模型在不同训练阶段和架构下的动态变化。

Method: 通过基于对数似然向量分配坐标的方法，高效估计语言模型间的KL散度，并系统评估了预训练检查点、微调模型、基础模型及不同层的行为。

Result: 研究发现，语言模型在预训练过程中呈现螺旋轨迹，不同层间呈现线状进展，且对数似然空间中的模型轨迹比权重空间更受限。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型在KL散度度量下的动态特性，为理解模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: A recently proposed method enables efficient estimation of the KL divergence
between language models, including models with different architectures, by
assigning coordinates based on log-likelihood vectors. To better understand the
behavior of this metric, we systematically evaluate KL divergence across a wide
range of conditions using publicly available language models. Our analysis
covers comparisons between pretraining checkpoints, fine-tuned and base models,
and layers via the logit lens. We find that trajectories of language models, as
measured by KL divergence, exhibit a spiral structure during pretraining and
thread-like progressions across layers. Furthermore, we show that, in terms of
diffusion exponents, model trajectories in the log-likelihood space are more
constrained than those in weight space.

Motivation: 研究语音产生的神经机制对认知神经科学理论和实用通信技术的发展至关重要。

Method: 使用17名参与者的脑磁图数据，采用多种机器学习方法（包括正则化线性模型和神经网络）进行音素分类。

Result: 语音产生的解码准确率（76.6%）显著高于被动听和回放（约51%），Delta和Theta频段对解码贡献最大。

Conclusion: 研究表明语音产生范式对改进脑机接口至关重要，但需进一步方法优化以排除肌肉或运动伪影的影响。

Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential
for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical
communication technologies. In this study, we investigated
magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during
speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks.
Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone
classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine
learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network
architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding
phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding
accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and
playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available
during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently
outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of
traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and
high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency
bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)
and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,
suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural
processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether
decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement
artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological
refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of
examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity,
offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals
with severe speech impairments.

Result: NL-DEBUGGING在调试任务中表现优于传统方法，且能通过自然语言扩展修改空间。

Conclusion: 自然语言推理能有效推动自动化代码调试发展，解决复杂编程问题。

Abstract: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging
efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when
addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of
algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance
code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What
type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what
specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging
process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that
employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code
debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that
NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader
modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our
findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance
automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型代理的研究主要集中在英语场景，而全球有7000多种语言需要类似的服务，现有技术无法满足多语言代理应用的需求。

Method: 通过引入X-WebAgentBench，一个在交互式网络环境中的多语言代理基准测试工具，评估语言代理在多语言环境中的规划和交互性能。

Result: 研究发现，即使是像GPT-4o这样的先进模型，结合跨语言技术后，仍无法达到令人满意的效果。

Conclusion: X-WebAgentBench有望成为现实应用中多语言代理场景的有价值基准测试工具，推动全球代理智能的发展。

Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant
success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and
industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research
predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000
languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services.
Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting
the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this
gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an
interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction
performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing
to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the
performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining
their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced
models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to
achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a
valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）虽然强大，但幻觉问题仍是其可信使用的障碍。现有方法虽能检测幻觉，但无法解释其来源。

Method: 提出RePPL方法，通过语义传播和语言生成中的不确定性，为每个token分配可解释的不确定性分数，并以困惑度风格的对数平均形式汇总。

Result: 实验表明，RePPL在多个QA数据集上达到最佳综合检测性能（平均AUC 0.833），并能生成token级不确定性分数作为幻觉解释。

Conclusion: RePPL不仅能有效检测幻觉，还能解释其来源，初步揭示了幻觉的混沌模式，展示了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain
a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the
capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack
the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,
which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the
prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where
attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level
semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language
generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for
sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty
measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty
scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as
total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive
detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average
AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty
scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we
preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its
promising usage.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的快速部署，其安全风险日益凸显。然而，现有评估多基于人工合成图像，缺乏对真实用户分享的迷因图片的安全性研究。

Method: 研究团队构建了包含50,430个实例的MemeSafetyBench基准，结合真实迷因图片与有害/无害指令，采用安全分类法和LLM生成指令，评估多模型在单轮/多轮交互中的表现。

Result: 迷因图片显著增加有害回复率（相比纯文本输入），并降低模型拒绝率。模型规模与安全指标存在关联，多轮交互仅能部分缓解风险。

Conclusion: 需开发更具生态效度的评估方法和更强的安全机制，以应对迷因驱动的视觉语言模型安全挑战。

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet
most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are
current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To
investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance
benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions.
Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we
assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate
how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of
conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs show greater vulnerability to
meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes
significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to
text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation,
elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for
ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms.

Result: 大型语言模型普遍存在浅层锚定效应，常规策略无法消除，但推理能部分缓解。

Conclusion: 呼吁大型语言模型评估应关注认知偏差而非标准基准测试，以实现可信评估。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has advanced natural
language processing, yet concerns about cognitive biases are growing. In this
paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind
relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments.
We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms,
and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the
anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined
evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show
that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not
eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some
mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM
evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness
tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学和编程等推理密集型任务上表现出色，但其推理能力的提升并未显著改善安全性，甚至可能降低安全性。因此，研究如何提升LRMs的安全性成为一个重要问题。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）进行实证研究，分析直接蒸馏安全响应的失败模式，并探索简化推理过程对安全性的影响。

Conclusion: 通过优化数据蒸馏过程和简化推理链，可以有效提升LRMs的安全性，同时保持其推理能力。研究为LRMs的安全性提升提供了全面视角。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on
reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their
enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety
performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important
research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we
present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs
through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an
unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1
fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify
three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that
explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can
lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and
complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we
find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain
comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn
than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection
on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math
reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and
over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more
holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our
experiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.

### [88] [Gated Integration of Low-Rank Adaptation for Continual Learning of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15424)
*Yan-Shuo Liang,Wu-Jun Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GainLoRA的新方法，通过引入门控模块来整合新旧LoRA分支，有效缓解持续学习中的遗忘问题，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LoRA的持续学习方法通常为每个新任务扩展一个新的LoRA分支，并强制新旧分支对旧任务贡献相等，这可能导致遗忘问题。

Method: GainLoRA为每个新任务扩展一个LoRA分支，并引入门控模块来整合新旧分支，同时最小化新分支对旧任务的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，GainLoRA在持续学习基准测试中优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: GainLoRA通过门控模块有效缓解了遗忘问题，提升了语言模型在持续学习中的整体性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL), which requires the model to learn multiple tasks
sequentially, is crucial for language models (LMs). Recently, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), one of the most representative parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, has gained increasing attention in CL of LMs.
However, most existing CL methods based on LoRA typically expand a new LoRA
branch to learn each new task and force the new and old LoRA branches to
contribute equally to old tasks, potentially leading to forgetting. In this
work, we propose a new method, called gated integration of low-rank adaptation
(GainLoRA), for CL of LMs. GainLoRA expands a new LoRA branch for each new task
and introduces gating modules to integrate the new and old LoRA branches.
Furthermore, GainLoRA leverages the new gating module to minimize the
contribution from the new LoRA branch to old tasks, effectively mitigating
forgetting and improving the model's overall performance. Experimental results
on CL benchmarks demonstrate that GainLoRA outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: NeoN, a tool for detecting and analyzing Polish neologisms. Unlike
traditional dictionary-based methods requiring extensive manual review, NeoN
combines reference corpora, Polish-specific linguistic filters, an LLM-driven
precision-boosting filter, and daily RSS monitoring in a multi-layered
pipeline. The system uses context-aware lemmatization, frequency analysis, and
orthographic normalization to extract candidate neologisms while consolidating
inflectional variants. Researchers can verify candidates through an intuitive
interface with visualizations and filtering controls. An integrated LLM module
automatically generates definitions and categorizes neologisms by domain and
sentiment. Evaluations show NeoN maintains high accuracy while significantly
reducing manual effort, providing an accessible solution for tracking lexical
innovation in Polish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自发现方法，通过在嵌入空间中识别语义方向向量，将文本提示限制在安全区域内，以减少扩散模型生成的NSFW内容和社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真图像方面表现出色，但也存在生成不适宜工作场所(NSFW)内容和社会偏见的问题，限制了其在实际应用中的使用。现有方法在防止有害内容生成方面效果不佳，且可能影响正常模型输出。

Method: 论文提出了一种自发现方法，识别嵌入空间中的语义方向向量，将整个文本提示引导至安全区域。此外，采用低秩适应(LoRA)进行语义方向向量初始化，以减少对其他语义模型性能的影响。该方法还可与现有方法结合使用。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，与现有先进基线方法相比，该方法能有效减少扩散模型生成的NSFW内容并缓解社会偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将文本提示限制在安全区域内，增强了模型对所有可能不安全提示的鲁棒性，同时减少了对其他语义模型性能的影响，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了更安全可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity images
has led to their widespread adoption. However, concerns have also arisen
regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and
exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world
applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on
employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or
alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive
concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory
performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal
model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content
in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to
identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text
embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting
individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt
towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model
robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the
impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method
can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social
responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias
generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于重采样的方法，通过选择关键文本来降低构建语言模型映射的计算成本，同时保持KL散度估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建语言模型映射的计算成本高昂，主要源于需要大量文本的对数似然计算。为了降低成本，需要一种高效的方法来选择重要文本。

Method: 采用重采样方法，根据每个文本在不同模型下对数似然的方差，按比例选择重要文本并赋予权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法仅需约一半文本量即可达到与均匀采样相当的性能，并能高效地将新模型纳入现有映射。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了语言模型映射的计算成本，实现了可扩展且高效的构建。

Abstract: We address the computational cost of constructing a model map, which embeds
diverse language models into a common space for comparison via KL divergence.
The map relies on log-likelihoods over a large text set, making the cost
proportional to the number of texts. To reduce this cost, we propose a
resampling method that selects important texts with weights proportional to the
variance of log-likelihoods across models for each text. Our method
significantly reduces the number of required texts while preserving the
accuracy of KL divergence estimates. Experiments show that it achieves
comparable performance to uniform sampling with about half as many texts, and
also facilitates efficient incorporation of new models into an existing map.
These results enable scalable and efficient construction of language model
maps.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，研究团队旨在开发一种高效且性能优越的模型，结合Mamba和Transformer的优势，以应对不同复杂度的查询需求。

Method: 采用混合Transformer-Mamba MoE架构，结合自适应长短思维链机制、多轮审议学习和两阶段大规模强化学习，预训练16T高质量token，支持256K上下文长度。

Result: 在LMSYS Chatbot Arena中排名前7，得分1356，超越Gemini-2.0-Flash-001等领先模型，23项自动化评测平均得分77.9%。

Conclusion: Hunyuan-TurboS在高效性和性能之间取得了平衡，以较低推理成本提供强大能力，为大规模预训练模型设立了新范式。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS,
a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It
synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with
Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an
adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching
between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for
complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B
activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,
FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear
complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE
structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context
length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our
comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,
Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage
Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general
instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank
on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like
Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves
an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances
high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower
inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for
efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

*Suhas Kamasetty Ramesh,Ayan Sengupta,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏（KD）能显著提升小语言模型性能（最高22%），但对大模型效果有限（仅1.3%）。教师模型的任务专长比其性能更重要，且KD可能牺牲推理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究对知识蒸馏在小语言模型上的效果及知识传递机制探索不足，需系统性评估不同规模模型的KD表现。

Method: 对0.5B-7B参数模型进行14项零样本推理任务的大规模实证分析，通过相关性研究、消融实验探究教师信号和logit平滑的影响。

Result: 小模型平均性能提升10%（单任务最高22%），教师任务专长决定KD效果；KD会降低推理过程与教师模型的对齐性。

Conclusion: KD对小模型压缩价值显著但存在精度-推理保真度权衡，教师信号设计和任务匹配是关键影响因素。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large language
models into smaller ones while preserving performance. Despite the recent
traction of KD research, its effectiveness for smaller language models (LMs)
and the mechanisms driving knowledge transfer remain underexplored. In this
work, we present the first large-scale empirical and statistical analysis of KD
across models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on 14 complex reasoning tasks
in a zero-shot setting. Our findings reveal that KD can improve the average
performance of smaller models by up to $10\%$, with a peak task specific gain
of $22\%$, while providing only marginal benefits ($\sim 1.3\%$) for larger
models. Surprisingly, teacher performance has a minimal impact on student
outcomes, while teacher task expertise impacts KD effectiveness. A correlation
study indicates that smaller LMs benefit more from KD, whereas larger LMs show
diminished gains. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between improvements
in student performance and reasoning fidelity, suggesting that while KD
enhances accuracy, it does not always maintain the structured decision-making
processes of the teacher. Our ablation study further highlights the importance
of teacher signals and logit smoothing in influencing students' performance
after distillation. Overall, our study offers a comprehensive empirical and
statistical assessment of KD, highlighting both its benefits and trade-offs
when distilling knowledge from larger to smaller LMs.

Motivation: 在参数高效的微调方法（如适配器）下，预训练语言模型在分类任务中的不确定性估计仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: AdUE1结合了可微的最大函数近似和L2-SP正则化，对微调后的头部权重进行锚定和正则化，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在五个NLP分类数据集和四种语言模型上的实验表明，AdUE1在不确定性估计上 consistently 优于基线方法（如马氏距离和softmax响应），且置信度校准更优。

Conclusion: AdUE1是一种轻量级、高效的不确定性估计方法，能够显著提升预训练语言模型在分类任务中的置信度校准效果。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation remains a critical challenge in adapting pre-trained
language models to classification tasks, particularly under parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches such as adapters. We introduce AdUE1, an efficient
post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) method, to enhance softmax-based
estimates. Our approach (1) uses a differentiable approximation of the maximum
function and (2) applies additional regularization through L2-SP, anchoring the
fine-tuned head weights and regularizing the model. Evaluations on five NLP
classification datasets across four language models (RoBERTa, ELECTRA, LLaMA-2,
Qwen) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms established
baselines such as Mahalanobis distance and softmax response. Our approach is
lightweight (no base-model changes) and produces better-calibrated confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在检索增强生成（RAG）的各个子任务上进行了优化，如查询理解和检索细化，但将这些优化整合到一个统一框架中仍具挑战性。

Method: RoleRAG包含六个模块，每个模块处理RAG过程中的特定子任务，并引入查询图表示查询的分解，通过任务特定的角色令牌驱动同一底层LLM。

Result: 在五个开放域问答数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架具有高效性、通用性和灵活性。

Conclusion: RoleRAG通过动态激活单一LLM实例中的不同模块，简化了部署并减少了资源消耗。

Abstract: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across
various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but
integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging.
To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework
that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token
optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task
within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent
the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to
the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM,
distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized.
This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a
single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource
consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of
our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示和离线优化的方法在冷启动和长期个性化方面表现不足，需要动态且深入的个性化对齐方案。

Method: 采用强化学习框架RLPA，通过双层次奖励机制（画像奖励和响应奖励）迭代优化用户画像和响应生成。

Result: 基于Qwen-2.5-3B调优的Qwen-RLPA在个性化对话中超越Claude-3.5和GPT-4o等商业模型。

Conclusion: 动态画像推断是构建个性化对话系统的有效范式，RLPA框架展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and
offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in
cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently
static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement
Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts
with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles
through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward
structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user
representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses
consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art
performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines,
and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o.
Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting
user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more
efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results
emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective
paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

Conclusion: Joint Flashback Adaptation无需回放数据且与任务无关，仅需少量flashbacks即可实现高效增量学习。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.
However, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to
catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,
optimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict
limitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint
Flashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of
prompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the
deviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then
interpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly
learning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data
sparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth
adaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without
access to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive
experiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+
instruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning
tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
improving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.

Conclusion: CoLA通过增强的灵活性和协作机制，有效解决了多任务微调中的干扰问题，尤其在数据稀缺时表现稳健。

Abstract: The scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals a power-law
relationship, showing diminishing return on performance as model scale
increases. While training LLMs from scratch is resource-intensive, fine-tuning
a pre-trained model for specific tasks has become a practical alternative. Full
fine-tuning (FFT) achieves strong performance; however, it is computationally
expensive and inefficient. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, like
LoRA, have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing the
pre-trained model and adding lightweight task-specific modules. LoRA, in
particular, has proven effective, but its application to multi-task scenarios
is limited by interference between tasks. Recent approaches, such as
Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and asymmetric LoRA, have aimed to mitigate these
issues but still struggle with sample scarcity and noise interference due to
their fixed structure. In response, we propose CoLA, a more flexible LoRA
architecture with an efficient initialization scheme, and introduces three
collaborative strategies to enhance performance by better utilizing the
quantitative relationships between matrices $A$ and $B$. Our experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of CoLA, outperforming existing
PEFT methods, especially in low-sample scenarios. Our data and code are fully
publicly available at https://github.com/zyy-2001/CoLA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

the critical intermediate steps of variable identification and process
formulation. To address these limitations, we introduce PhysicsArena, the first
multimodal physics reasoning benchmark designed to holistically evaluate MLLMs
across three critical dimensions: variable identification, physical process
formulation, and solution derivation. PhysicsArena aims to provide a
comprehensive platform for assessing and advancing the multimodal physics
reasoning abilities of MLLMs.

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention
due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to
socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases,
particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of
gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and
GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the
degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named
AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is
used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that
contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score
(UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more
effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning)
algorithm.The algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to
gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating
Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated
with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function.
Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can
significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general
capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为KaFT的知识感知微调方法，通过根据知识冲突程度调整训练样本权重，显著提升了大型语言模型在领域特定问答任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的有监督微调方法在处理领域特定问答任务时，由于模型内部知识与训练数据上下文知识之间的冲突，导致性能不佳。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 论文首先设计了查询多样化策略以检测知识冲突，然后提出KaFT方法，根据冲突程度为不同训练样本分配不同的奖励权重。

Result: 实验表明，KaFT在四种大型语言模型上均带来了显著且一致的性能提升，同时改善了模型的泛化能力并减轻了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: KaFT是一种简单而有效的方法，能够通过知识冲突感知的微调策略显著提升大型语言模型在领域特定问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the
domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models
(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between
LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla
SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we
first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and
then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge
conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute
differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic
performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,
appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by
this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely
KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to
adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training
samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT
brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses
prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates
the hallucination.

TL;DR: 论文提出'protoknowledge'概念，量化大语言模型预训练时对知识图谱的编码及推理时的利用方式，通过知识激活任务(KATs)测量其语义偏差，并研究其对Text-to-SPARQL任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何将预训练时记忆的token序列通过泛化转化为可复用知识，并量化这种知识的内在化过程。

Method: 将protoknowledge分为词汇、层级和拓扑三类，设计知识激活任务(KATs)测量其语义偏差，通过不同提示策略分析对Text-to-SPARQL性能的影响。

Result: 提出评估模型预测与protoknowledge激活对齐的新框架，揭示了语义级数据污染的规律，为封闭预训练模型提供有效策略。

Conclusion: protoknowledge框架为分析大语言模型的知识利用机制提供了实用工具，特别适用于检测预训练数据的语义污染问题。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an
effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放作为一种广泛采用的推理策略，其有效性主要在英语中得到研究，而在其他语言中的表现尚不明确。论文旨在填补这一空白，探索多语言环境下测试时缩放的效果及其不一致性。

Method: 论文评估了DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型在高资源和低资源拉丁语系语言中的表现，并提出了一种名为MITT的无监督轻量级推理前缀调优方法，通过迁移高资源语言的推理前缀来提升多语言推理性能。

Result: 研究发现，测试时缩放的性能提升在不同语言间差异显著，低资源语言的初始推理思维与英语差异较大且内部一致性较低。MITT方法显著提升了DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B模型的推理性能，尤其是对低资源语言。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了多语言环境下测试时缩放的不一致性，并提出MITT方法有效提升了低资源语言的推理性能，为多语言推理优化提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for
boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied
almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely
unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in
multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script
languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling
vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to
English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts.
We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning
thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal
consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our
findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an
unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers
high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all
languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance.
MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance,
especially for underrepresented languages.

TL;DR: 研究发现主流QA和RC基准存在人口统计和地域偏见，呼吁更透明、更具偏見意识的基准创建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QA和RC基准在评估大语言模型时存在偏见，未能公平覆盖不同人口统计和地域的问题，可能源于基准创建者缺乏多样性。

Method: 对30篇基准论文进行定性内容分析，并对20个基准数据集进行定量分析，考察基准创建者构成、社会偏见处理方式及创建者背景与内容偏见的关系。

Result: 大多数基准论文未充分披露创建者信息，仅一篇明确报告了解决社会代表性问题的措施。数据分析显示普遍存在性别、宗教和地域偏见。

Conclusion: 需要更透明和关注偏见的QA和RC基准创建实践，以促进更公平的大语言模型发展。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) and reading comprehension (RC) benchmarks are
essential for assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
retrieving and reproducing knowledge. However, we demonstrate that popular QA
and RC benchmarks are biased and do not cover questions about different
demographics or regions in a representative way, potentially due to a lack of
diversity of those involved in their creation. We perform a qualitative content
analysis of 30 benchmark papers and a quantitative analysis of 20 respective
benchmark datasets to learn (1) who is involved in the benchmark creation, (2)
how social bias is addressed or prevented, and (3) whether the demographics of
the creators and annotators correspond to particular biases in the content.
Most analyzed benchmark papers provided insufficient information regarding the
stakeholders involved in benchmark creation, particularly the annotators.
Notably, just one of the benchmark papers explicitly reported measures taken to
address social representation issues. Moreover, the data analysis revealed
gender, religion, and geographic biases across a wide range of encyclopedic,
commonsense, and scholarly benchmarks. More transparent and bias-aware QA and
RC benchmark creation practices are needed to facilitate better scrutiny and
incentivize the development of fairer LLMs.

Abstract: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when
encountering an argumentative text. We present our system for the Critical
Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) Shared Task at ArgMining 2025. Our approach
leverages large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought prompting to
generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each
input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the
corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments,
and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the
available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful
questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of
structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the
generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our
pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its
potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect
missing or uninformed claims. Code available at

Result: 超过60%的查询在检索前10段落中包含高度干扰内容，位置偏差的实际影响较小。

Conclusion: 基于LLM位置偏好的复杂段落重排策略并不比随机打乱效果更好。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages
retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates
how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently
based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to
capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting
passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how
state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant
passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with
over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among
the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional
bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by
related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and
distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that
sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM
positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization
for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which
requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an
online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly
adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by
emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving
away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without
human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary
models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance
pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the
Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve
reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally
enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's
instructional planning.

Conclusion: LASER-D通过动态和难度感知的奖励机制，实现了性能与效率的更好平衡，减少了冗余推理。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by
generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit
substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we
investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,
we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient
reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on
this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method
(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target
length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal
balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based
on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during
training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and
dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of
thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be
difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.
This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow
thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed
LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both
reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and
its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage
by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise
reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at

Abstract: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the
potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the
public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible.
While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on
retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether
the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we
explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this
setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in
climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact
the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's
training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement
in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our
automatic metric.

Motivation: 受DeepSeek-R1深度思考范式的启发，研究旨在不依赖昂贵的高质量长链思维（CoT）数据的情况下，增强LLM的复杂问题推理能力。

Method: 首先使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从普通CoT中提取可解释特征，用于引导LLM生成时的内部状态；进一步提出无需SAE的引导算法，直接从LLM的残差激活中计算引导方向。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于SAE和无SAE的引导算法均能显著提升LLM的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效且低成本的方法，通过内部状态引导增强LLM的推理性能，无需依赖外部数据集或精细调整。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and
mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT
length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this
reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT
data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of
DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of
an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are
then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing
that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce
a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering
directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an
explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and
subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

prediction in the Canary model. Accurate timestamp information is crucial for a
variety of downstream tasks such as speech content retrieval and timed
subtitles. While traditional hybrid systems and end-to-end (E2E) models may
employ external modules for timestamp prediction, our approach eliminates the
need for separate alignment mechanisms. By leveraging the NeMo Forced Aligner
(NFA) as a teacher model, we generate word-level timestamps and train the
Canary model to predict timestamps directly. We introduce a new <|timestamp|>
token, enabling the Canary model to predict start and end timestamps for each
word. Our method demonstrates precision and recall rates between 80% and 90%,
with timestamp prediction errors ranging from 20 to 120 ms across four
languages, with minimal WER degradation. Additionally, we extend our system to
automatic speech translation (AST) tasks, achieving timestamp prediction errors
around 200 milliseconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示开源大语言模型微调过程中潜在的数据泄露风险，提醒开发者关注并解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在4种开源模型上进行实验，使用黑盒访问微调后的下游模型，测试数据提取效果。

Result: 实验显示，攻击者可提取高达76.3%的私有数据，理想条件下可达94.9%。防御策略可被绕过。

Conclusion: 研究强调了微调过程中新发现的数据泄露风险，呼吁更多后续研究解决这一问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with proprietary data
is now a standard practice for downstream developers to obtain task-specific
LLMs. Surprisingly, we reveal a new and concerning risk along with the
practice: the creator of the open-source LLMs can later extract the private
downstream fine-tuning data through simple backdoor training, only requiring
black-box access to the fine-tuned downstream model. Our comprehensive
experiments, across 4 popularly used open-source models with 3B to 32B
parameters and 2 downstream datasets, suggest that the extraction performance
can be strikingly high: in practical settings, as much as 76.3% downstream
fine-tuning data (queries) out of a total 5,000 samples can be perfectly
extracted, and the success rate can increase to 94.9% in more ideal settings.
We also explore a detection-based defense strategy but find it can be bypassed
with improved attack. Overall, we highlight the emergency of this newly
identified data breaching risk in fine-tuning, and we hope that more follow-up
research could push the progress of addressing this concerning risk. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音模型局限于轮流对话，缺乏实时适应性（如用户打断）。需构建能直接建模用户与AI同时语音流的双工系统。

Method: 采用分离的用户/AI编码架构，预训练流式编码器处理用户输入，通过通道融合实现双工；优化编解码器使AI语音质量提升且比特率减半。

Result: 模型在推理、话轮转换和打断能力上优于基线，比特率降至0.6kbps，且成为首个开源训练/推理代码的双工语音模型。

Conclusion: 该架构为LLMs构建双工语音系统提供简化方案，突破预训练依赖，推动可复现研究。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue is an intuitive form of human-computer interaction, yet
current speech language models often remain constrained to turn-based
exchanges, lacking real-time adaptability such as user barge-in. We propose a
novel duplex speech to speech (S2S) architecture featuring continuous user
inputs and codec agent outputs with channel fusion that directly models
simultaneous user and agent streams. Using a pretrained streaming encoder for
user input enables the first duplex S2S model without requiring speech
pretrain. Separate architectures for agent and user modeling facilitate codec
fine-tuning for better agent voices and halve the bitrate (0.6 kbps) compared
to previous works. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms previous duplex models in reasoning, turn-taking, and barge-in
abilities. The model requires significantly less speech data, as speech
pretrain is skipped, which markedly simplifies the process of building a duplex
S2S model from any LLMs. Finally, it is the first openly available duplex S2S
model with training and inference code to foster reproducibility.

TL;DR: UniErase提出了一种新的机器学习遗忘范式，通过可学习的参数后缀引导模型实现定向遗忘，在保持模型能力的同时高效移除敏感信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于微调的遗忘方法难以平衡遗忘效果与模型能力，而基于上下文提示的方法泛化性有限。需要一种能同时保证遗忘效果和模型性能的新方法。

Method: UniErase采用两阶段方法：1)通过令牌优化将目标遗忘输出绑定到模型的自回归概率分布；2)轻量级模型编辑阶段激活学习到的令牌以概率性诱导指定遗忘目标。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，仅修改约3.66%参数的UniErase，模型能力超越之前最佳遗忘基线约4.01倍，同时遗忘效果更优；在保持更强能力的同时，遗忘效果比之前最佳保留基线高35.96%。

Conclusion: UniErase在批量、顺序和精确遗忘任务中均达到最先进水平，为令牌学习诱导遗忘目标开辟了新研究方向，在当前遗忘领域实现了双重顶级性能。

Abstract: Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as
knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or
illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for
targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of
sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based
unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,
frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge
removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual
prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from
limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this
work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable
parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted
forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an
optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's
autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by
(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to
probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new
research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and
precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.
Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%
of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around
4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,
UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by
35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current
unlearing domain.

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和语言模型在具体性维度上表征一致，但在其他心理语言学维度上不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨具体性在人类心智和大脑中的表征方式，以及语言模型是否能够捕捉这一维度。

Method: 使用行为判断和表征相似性分析（RSA），比较人类和语言模型在抽象与具体名词上的语义表征。

Result: 人类和语言模型的表征空间在具体性维度上显著对齐，且这种对齐主要由具体性驱动。

Conclusion: 人类和语言模型在具体性维度上趋同，但在其他重要词汇特征上未表现出一致性。

Abstract: The nouns of our language refer to either concrete entities (like a table) or
abstract concepts (like justice or love), and cognitive psychology has
established that concreteness influences how words are processed. Accordingly,
understanding how concreteness is represented in our mind and brain is a
central question in psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics.
While the advent of powerful language models has allowed for quantitative
inquiries into the nature of semantic representations, it remains largely
underexplored how they represent concreteness. Here, we used behavioral
judgments to estimate semantic distances implicitly used by humans, for a set
of carefully selected abstract and concrete nouns. Using Representational
Similarity Analysis, we find that the implicit representational space of
participants and the semantic representations of language models are
significantly aligned. We also find that both representational spaces are
implicitly aligned to an explicit representation of concreteness, which was
obtained from our participants using an additional concreteness rating task.
Importantly, using ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the human-to-model
alignment is substantially driven by concreteness, but not by other important
word characteristics established in psycholinguistics. These results indicate
that humans and language models converge on the concreteness dimension, but not
on other dimensions.

TL;DR: FL-LLaMA是一个基于LLaMA2的安全、高效且自适应的联邦分割框架，通过本地化输入输出块、高斯噪声注入、并行训练和动态分割点调整，解决了隐私、效率和适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 私有数据通常比公共数据更大且质量更高，但分散存储和高计算需求限制了其在联邦环境中的应用。现有分割学习模型在安全性、效率和适应性方面仍面临挑战。

Method: FL-LLaMA将部分输入输出块保留在本地客户端，注入高斯噪声确保安全传播；采用客户端批次和服务器分层策略实现并行训练；通过注意力掩码压缩和KV缓存加速推理；支持动态调整分割点。

Result: 实验表明，FL-LLaMA在NLU、摘要和对话QA任务中性能与集中式LLaMA2相当，训练速度提升2倍，推理速度提升8倍，且能有效抵御隐私攻击。

Conclusion: FL-LLaMA在安全性、效率和适应性方面表现优异，为联邦环境中大规模语言模型的部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Private data is typically larger and of higher quality than public data,
offering great potential to improve LLM. However, its scattered distribution
across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their
deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based
split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the
server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to
ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security,
efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks,
leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of
LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially,
causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack
adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a
secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2.
First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject
Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end
propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies
to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV
cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs
effectively. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points
for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements and hardware
limitations. Experiments on NLU, summarization and conversational QA tasks show
that FL-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2, and
achieves up to 2x train speedups and 8x inference speedups. Further analysis of
privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the
effectiveness of FL-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkLess框架通过提前终止推理生成减少计算开销，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法因推理过程冗长导致延迟增加、内存占用高，并可能在上下文限制下截断最终答案。

Method: ThinkLess利用注意力机制分析，在推理过程中早期插入终止符以跳过冗余步骤，并通过轻量级后调节机制确保答案格式正确。

Result: ThinkLess在不微调模型或使用额外数据的情况下，实现了与完整CoT解码相当的准确性，同时显著减少了解码时间和内存消耗。

Conclusion: ThinkLess是一种高效推理框架，通过优化推理过程显著提升大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and
KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context
limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates
reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the
model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on
earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token,
due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight,
ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant
reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format
discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight
post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following
ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary
data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while
greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法偏向奖励最大化路径，缺乏外部知识引导，导致探索能力受限和推理边界狭窄。

Method: TAPO框架在训练中自适应整合结构化思维模式，平衡模型内部探索与外部引导利用。

Result: 实验显示TAPO在AIME、AMC和Minerva Math任务上分别超越GRPO 99%、41%和17%，且仅需500样本即可泛化。

Conclusion: TAPO通过外部引导构建可解释性强、可读性高的推理模型，具备跨任务和领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective method for training
reasoning models. However, existing RL approaches typically bias the model's
output distribution toward reward-maximizing paths without introducing external
knowledge. This limits their exploration capacity and results in a narrower
reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. To address this
limitation, we propose TAPO (Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization), a novel
framework that augments RL by incorporating external high-level guidance
("thought patterns"). By adaptively integrating structured thoughts during
training, TAPO effectively balances model-internal exploration and external
guidance exploitation. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly outperforms GRPO by 99% on AIME, 41% on AMC, and 17% on Minerva
Math. Notably, these high-level thought patterns, abstracted from only 500
prior samples, generalize effectively across various tasks and models. This
highlights TAPO's potential for broader applications across multiple tasks and
domains. Our further analysis reveals that introducing external guidance
produces powerful reasoning models with superior explainability of inference
behavior and enhanced output readability.

Abstract: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into
customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex,
and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to
traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online
Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol
designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions
effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides
extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive
opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content,
thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive
capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs
exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion
miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for
LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this
field.

Motivation: 现有研究表明BERT的[CLS]标记以外的其他标记和中间层也包含有价值的上下文信息，但未被充分利用。

Method: 提出三种改进：(1)跨层对[CLS]标记进行最大池化；(2)用额外多头注意力层让[CLS]关注最终层；(3)结合序列最大池化与多头注意力。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，MaxPoolBERT consistently优于标准BERT-base模型，尤其在低资源任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: MaxPoolBERT通过轻量级扩展有效提升BERT分类性能，无需预训练或显著增加参数量。

Abstract: The [CLS] token in BERT is commonly used as a fixed-length representation for
classification tasks, yet prior work has shown that both other tokens and
intermediate layers encode valuable contextual information. In this work, we
propose MaxPoolBERT, a lightweight extension to BERT that refines the [CLS]
representation by aggregating information across layers and tokens.
Specifically, we explore three modifications: (i) max-pooling the [CLS] token
across multiple layers, (ii) enabling the [CLS] token to attend over the entire
final layer using an additional multi-head attention (MHA) layer, and (iii)
combining max-pooling across the full sequence with MHA. Our approach enhances
BERT's classification accuracy (especially on low-resource tasks) without
requiring pre-training or significantly increasing model size. Experiments on
the GLUE benchmark show that MaxPoolBERT consistently achieves a better
performance on the standard BERT-base model.

Result: 实验表明，LyapLock支持超过10,000次连续编辑，平均编辑效能提升11.89%，同时保持模型通用能力稳定。

Conclusion: LyapLock是首个具有严格理论保证的模型编辑框架，实现了渐进最优编辑性能，并能增强基线方法的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated
knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates.
However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive
performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for
long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential
editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by
the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing
tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov
optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable
stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing
framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal
editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge
preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential
editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities
and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines.
Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline
methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SRR显著提高了对抗性提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SRR通过利用大语言模型内部表示有效提升了生成内容的安全性，为模型安全评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated
milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating
harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety
evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses,
overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal
representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR),
a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states
from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions
using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a
lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal
model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety
signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly
improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon

Abstract: This paper introduces TurnaboutLLM, a novel framework and dataset for
evaluating the deductive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
leveraging the interactive gameplay of detective games Ace Attorney and
Danganronpa. The framework tasks LLMs with identifying contradictions between
testimonies and evidences within long narrative contexts, a challenging task
due to the large answer space and diverse reasoning types presented by its
questions. We evaluate twelve state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset, hinting at
limitations of popular strategies for enhancing deductive reasoning such as
extensive thinking and Chain-of-Thought prompting. The results also suggest
varying effects of context size, the number of reasoning step and answer space

Method: 提出自动化数据合成流程，处理真实心理健康帖子，生成多轮对话结构，并利用LLM模拟临床推理过程。

Result: PsyLLM在全面性、专业性、真实性和安全性四个维度上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyLLM为心理健康咨询提供了一个系统化、临床基础强的解决方案，显著提升了咨询质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health
support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic
conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical
grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in
explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and
incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single
strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first
large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and
therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we
propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes
real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and
leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and
multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate
detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering
ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In
addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing
counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,
professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that
PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual
Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across
diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are
increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become
critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving
multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed
nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that
memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to
fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating
languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true
patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based
correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze
cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,
those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend
that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.
These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in
evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also
constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains
Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad
implications for multilingual NLP.

Conclusion: VocalBench为语音交互模型的全面评估提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并指导未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the
development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike
text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including
semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental
context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models
predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often
overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with
vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models'
capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully
curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic
performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental
skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal
significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct
strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future
research in speech-based interaction systems. Code and evaluation instances are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型依赖海量数据提升推理能力，但仅靠增加数据已不切实际，需要模型能够自主提升推理能力而无需外部监督。

Method: 提出了DTE框架，利用多智能体辩论轨迹训练单一语言模型，并引入Reflect-Critique-Refine提示策略以提升辩论质量。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DTE框架显著提升了模型性能，尤其在GSM-PLUS数据集上平均准确率提高了8.92%，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTE框架能够有效提升语言模型的通用推理能力，且无需依赖真实标签，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning
through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on
additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical,
highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning
without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve
(DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent
debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new
prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by
explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive
evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that
our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy
gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe
strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on
all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning
capabilities.

*Huanxuan Liao,Wen Hu,Yao Xu,Shizhu He,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出HyCo$_2$方法，通过结合全局和局部视角优化LLM的长序列推理，在减少token使用的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长序列推理中存在计算效率低和冗余处理问题，且容易丢失有价值信息，需要一种能平衡全局语义和局部细节的压缩方法。

Method: HyCo$_2$采用混合适配器优化全局语义，并通过分类层基于局部视角保留关键token，结合辅助预训练实现全局与局部压缩的平衡。

Result: HyCo$_2$在7个知识密集型QA基准上平均提升13.1%，同时减少88.8%的token消耗，性能与未压缩方法相当。

Conclusion: HyCo$_2$有效解决了长序列推理中的信息保留与效率问题，为LLM的上下文压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in
long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant
processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing
methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or
encode context into latent representations for soft global compression.
However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity
of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the
loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for
LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context
compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details
for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global
semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different
adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer
that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local
view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a
balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary
paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This
promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant
information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing
local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show
that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while
reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an
average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover,
HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token
consumption by 88.8\%.

TL;DR: ConvSearch-R1提出了一种自驱动的对话查询重构框架，通过强化学习直接优化检索信号，无需外部监督，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话查询重构方法高度依赖昂贵的外部监督（如人工标注或大语言模型），且与下游检索器对齐不足。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 自驱动策略预热通过检索引导的自蒸馏解决冷启动问题；2) 检索引导的强化学习，设计了排名激励奖励机制以解决传统检索指标的稀疏性问题。

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QReCC数据集上，ConvSearch-R1显著优于现有方法，在TopiOCQA上提升超过10%，且仅使用30亿参数模型。

Conclusion: ConvSearch-R1首次完全消除了对外部重构监督的依赖，通过检索信号直接优化重构，为对话搜索系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent
queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational
Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these
queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers.
However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high
dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large
language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and
downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven
framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision
by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through
retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy
Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided
self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a
specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the
sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on
TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement
on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models
without any external supervision.

Motivation: 当前推理模型受限于离散语言标记，无法充分探索推理路径，限制了表达能力和潜力。

Method: 通过概率加权的标记嵌入混合生成连续概念空间中的抽象概念标记，实现平滑过渡和更丰富的表示。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，'软思考'方法显著提高了准确率（最高提升2.48分）并减少了标记使用量（最高减少22.4%）。

Conclusion: '软思考'方法突破了基于离散语言的推理瓶颈，同时保持了输出的可解释性和可读性。

Abstract: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts
rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning
models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human
language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in
the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and
upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration
of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling
one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free
method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract
concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created
by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the
continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer
representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence,
each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related
discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge
effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse
mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points
while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard
CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain
highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking
to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning. Code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为延迟KV-Cache的机制，用于加速扩散语言模型的推理过程，显著提升了推理速度，缩小了与自回归模型的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型（DLMs）因其非自回归架构和双向注意力机制，无法利用键值缓存（KV-Cache）加速推理，导致推理速度较慢。论文旨在解决这一瓶颈问题。

Method: 论文提出了延迟KV-Cache机制，包括两种变体：dKV-Cache-Decode（几乎无损加速）和dKV-Cache-Greedy（更高加速但性能略有下降）。该机制通过逐步缓存键和值状态来优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明，延迟KV-Cache在多个基准测试（通用语言理解、数学和代码生成）中实现了2-10倍的推理加速，且无需额外训练即可应用于现有DLMs。

Conclusion: 延迟KV-Cache有效解决了DLMs推理速度慢的问题，显著提升了性能，并证明缓存机制在DLMs中的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have been seen as a promising competitor for
autoregressive language models. However, diffusion language models have long
been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their
non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the
key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by
proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising
process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different
tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process.
Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and
value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value
step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless
acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that
existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2)
dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving
higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance
degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference,
largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on
several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language
understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments
demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner
from current DLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DoveScore框架，通过联合验证事实准确性和事件顺序一致性，提升了长文本对齐评估的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度评估方法（如FactScore）虽能单独验证事实，但忽略了事实间依赖关系，导致对欺骗性叙述的脆弱性。

Method: 提出MontageLie基准测试构建欺骗性叙述，并开发DoveScore框架，建模事实间关系以联合验证事实准确性和事件顺序。

Result: DoveScore在AUC-ROC上超越现有细粒度方法8%以上，对长文本对齐评估更鲁棒。

Conclusion: DoveScore通过建模事实间关系，显著提升了评估框架对欺骗性叙述的防御能力。

Abstract: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks
and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user
trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually
but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this
work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs
deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing
explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based
evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack,
with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained
evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies
factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact
relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%,
providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dannalily/DoveScore.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估框架易受恶意利用，需探索更可靠方法。

Method: 利用judge-LLM信号作为奖励，对抗性调整生成文本前导的模型。

Result: 调整后的前导生成模型能提升下游LLM评估分数，且方法难以检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评估设计的可靠性问题，并展示了逆向工程人类偏好的潜力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by
other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as
LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also
vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit
the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by
a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them
by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal
provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate
text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen
LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than
existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene
directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also
demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers
when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not
used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design
of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that
human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to
optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could
find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved
remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their
training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement
learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate
reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding
of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two
benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the
performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed
through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human
annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room
for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially
smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive
analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and
developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as
effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the
reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为CoPriva的大规模基准数据集，用于评估大语言模型在问答任务中遵守上下文非披露策略的能力，发现现有模型存在泄露敏感信息的严重漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业和政府等敏感领域的广泛应用，确保其在上下文中遵守用户定义的安全策略（尤其是信息非披露）变得至关重要。然而，目前缺乏针对上下文安全保护的大规模基准测试。

Method: 研究团队构建了CoPriva数据集，包含现实场景中的显式策略和查询，设计了直接和间接攻击来测试模型。评估了10个大语言模型在遵守非披露策略方面的表现。

Result: 研究发现许多模型会违反用户定义的政策并泄露敏感信息，特别是在面对间接攻击时表现更差。模型虽然能识别正确答案，但难以在生成过程中整合策略约束。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在敏感应用中的安全对齐存在重大缺陷，亟需开发更鲁棒的方法来保证上下文安全性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to
user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with
respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on
general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for
contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address
this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating
LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering.
Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and
queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited
information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant
vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive
information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks,
highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive
applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the
correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints
during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise
outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型的知识利用机制提供了可解释性洞察，为构建更安全透明的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access
external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation.
While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light
on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by
viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an
attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing
in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual
information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To
better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their
attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process.
Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used
during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language
models.

Abstract: Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm,
coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought
reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial
performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis
experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,
output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising
from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding
tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate
chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse
grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals
or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and
poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy
examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to
under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three
targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages
direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,
we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate
reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length
normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better
optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on
ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even
outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI
agent grounding. The project repository is available at

Motivation: 现有大语言模型通常仅使用单一模态（如自然语言）进行训练和推理，缺乏多模态协同，限制了模型在复杂逻辑问题上的表现。

Method: MoT框架采用两阶段设计：1）自演化的多模态联合训练，从过滤后的自生成多模态依据中学习；2）推理时协同利用三种模态的优势。

Conclusion: 多模态协同训练和推理能有效提升逻辑推理能力，其中真值表模态可弥补自然语言推理的关键缺陷，三种模态具有互补优势。

Abstract: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and
solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as
natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing
LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training,
typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection
or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind,
limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose
Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three
complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced
symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases
and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT
adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns
from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT
inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce
better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO
and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and
significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality
chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain.
Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and
inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning
problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths,
with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural
language inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出BiasLens框架，无需标注数据即可检测大语言模型中的偏见，通过向量空间结构分析概念间相关性，揭示传统方法难以发现的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏见评估方法依赖人工标注数据且覆盖范围有限，难以全面捕捉大语言模型中的复杂偏见模式，亟需自动化、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合概念激活向量(CAVs)与稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，通过测量目标概念与参考概念的表示相似性变化来量化偏见。

Result: BiasLens与传统评估指标高度一致(Spearman相关系数r>0.85)，并能发现保险状态影响临床诊断等新型偏见案例。

Conclusion: BiasLens为偏见检测提供了可扩展、可解释的高效范式，有助于提升大语言模型的公平性与透明度。

Abstract: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
"positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.

### [146] [Follow the STARs: Dynamic $ω$-Regular Shielding of Learned Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14689)
*Ashwani Anand,Satya Prakash Nayak,Ritam Raha,Anne-Kathrin Schmuck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的动态后屏蔽框架STARs，能够在预计算概率策略上强制执行全面的ω-regular正确性属性，实现从安全屏蔽到同时保证活跃性的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全屏蔽主要关注确保不发生坏事，而忽略了确保好事最终发生的活跃性属性。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种能够同时保证安全性和活跃性的屏蔽框架。

Method: 采用基于策略模板的自适应运行时屏蔽（STARs），利用宽松的策略模板实现最小干扰的后屏蔽，并通过动态控制干扰机制平衡形式化义务和任务特定行为。

Result: 在移动机器人基准测试中，STARs展示了在强制执行（增量更新的）ω-regular正确性属性时的可控干扰能力。

Conclusion: STARs通过动态控制干扰和支持运行时适应，特别适合信息物理应用，能够在需要时触发更积极的强制执行，同时允许优化策略选择。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dynamic post-shielding framework that enforces
the full class of $\omega$-regular correctness properties over pre-computed
probabilistic policies. This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant
setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens --
to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures
that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses
Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage
permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal
interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically
control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance
formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to
trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized
policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to
changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for
cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to
demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally
updated) $\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic
policies.

Conclusion: R&D-Agent通过协同迭代机制缩小了自动化方案与专家水平的差距，其开源版本有望加速数据科学领域的创新发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI and ML have transformed data science, yet increasing
complexity and expertise requirements continue to hinder progress. While
crowdsourcing platforms alleviate some challenges, high-level data science
tasks remain labor-intensive and iterative. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce R&D-Agent, a dual-agent framework for iterative exploration. The
Researcher agent uses performance feedback to generate ideas, while the
Developer agent refines code based on error feedback. By enabling multiple
parallel exploration traces that merge and enhance one another, R&D-Agent
narrows the gap between automated solutions and expert-level performance.
Evaluated on MLE-Bench, R&D-Agent emerges as the top-performing machine
learning engineering agent, demonstrating its potential to accelerate
innovation and improve precision across diverse data science applications. We
have open-sourced R&D-Agent on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出强大的推理能力，但对其内部如何执行复杂算法的理解仍然有限，主要障碍在于预训练数据的复杂性和缺乏标注。

Method: 构建了一个包含35亿token的数据集，其中包含880万个人工标注的LLM增强示例和750万个由自动定理求解器生成的合成示例。

Result: 提供了一个可扩展、可解释的数据集，用于研究LLM如何学习和泛化符号推理过程。

Conclusion: 该数据集为更透明、有针对性的研究现代模型的算法能力铺平了道路。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capabilities such as coding and solving mathematical problems to
commonsense inference. While these tasks vary in complexity, they all require
models to integrate and compute over structured information. Despite recent
efforts to reverse-engineer LLM behavior through controlled experiments, our
understanding of how these models internalize and execute complex algorithms
remains limited. Progress has largely been confined to small-scale studies or
shallow tasks such as basic arithmetic and grammatical pattern matching. One
barrier to deeper understanding is the nature of pretraining data -- vast,
heterogeneous, and often poorly annotated, making it difficult to isolate
mechanisms of reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale, fully
open, complexity-annotated dataset of first-order logic reasoning traces,
designed to probe and analyze algorithmic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset
consists of 3.5 billion tokens, including 8.8 million LLM-augmented,
human-annotated examples and 7.5 million synthetically generated examples. Each
synthetic example is verifiably correct, produced by a custom automated theorem
solver, and accompanied by metadata tracing its algorithmic provenance. We aim
to provide a scalable, interpretable artifact for studying how LLMs learn and
generalize symbolic reasoning processes, paving the way for more transparent
and targeted investigations into the algorithmic capabilities of modern models.

Abstract: Since Edmund Husserl coined the term "Formal Ontologies" in the early 20th
century, a field that identifies itself with this particular branch of sciences
has gained increasing attention. Many authors, and even Husserl himself have
developed what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close
inspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the
Husserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most
important notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl's Logical
Investigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and
formalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the
work previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it
really is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the
Husserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his
conditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture
what is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising
from perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal
structure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable
information artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal
ontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of
the conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I
argue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are
likely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in
their internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well.
I hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to
act as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to
understand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLUF框架，通过用户反馈直接优化大语言模型，解决了现有方法依赖专家标注的局限性，并在实验中显著提升了用户正面反馈率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法（RLHF）依赖专家标注，可能无法反映真实用户偏好。为直接对齐用户隐式反馈（如表情反应），需解决其稀疏性、二元性及对抗性问题。

Method: 提出RLUF框架：训练奖励模型P[Love]预测用户正面反馈概率，并整合至多目标策略优化框架（兼顾帮助性、安全性）。

Result: P[Love]能有效预测用户行为，在线A/B测试中使正面反馈率提升28%，但需平衡目标以避免奖励滥用。

Conclusion: RLUF通过直接利用用户隐式信号，为大语言模型与真实用户偏好对齐提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse user
facing applications, aligning them with real user preferences becomes
essential. Existing methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) rely on expert annotators trained on manually defined guidelines, whose
judgments may not reflect the priorities of everyday users. We introduce
Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs
directly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key
challenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji
reactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model,
P[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love
Reaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love]
into a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and
safety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is
predictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline
evaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love]
significantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase
in Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive
reactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of
objectives. By directly leveraging implicit signals from users, RLUF offers a
path to aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences at scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEC的自动课程学习方法，通过多臂老虎机问题优化强化学习微调过程中的课程顺序，显著提升了大型语言模型在多个推理领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习微调方法中，课程顺序（训练问题的呈现顺序）对模型性能有重要影响。随机课程效果不佳，手动设计依赖启发式方法，而在线筛选方法计算成本高。因此，需要一种自动化的课程学习方法来优化这一过程。

Method: 提出Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC)方法，将课程选择建模为非平稳多臂老虎机问题，每个问题类别（如难度或类型）视为一个臂。利用策略梯度方法的绝对优势作为即时学习收益的代理指标，通过TD(0)方法更新课程策略。

Result: 在规划、归纳推理和数学三个推理领域的实验中，SEC显著提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在泛化到更难、分布外测试问题时表现更优。同时，在多推理领域微调时能更好地平衡技能。

Conclusion: SEC是一种有前景的强化学习微调策略，能够自动优化课程顺序，显著提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in
domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing
RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training
problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they
remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on
heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To
address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an
automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy
concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates
curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating
each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual
arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy
measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum
policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using
the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive
reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly
improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to
harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves
better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning
domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL
fine-tuning of LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 为了实现未来人机交互的有效性和流畅性，需要开发能够分析并满足人类需求的自动驾驶系统，尤其是考虑人类认知状态的系统。

Method: 论文采用动态贝叶斯网络（DBN）构建计算模型，推断AV用户及其他道路使用者的认知状态（如幸福感、信任和意图），并通过交互研究数据优化模型参数。

Result: 模型能够准确预测用户状态，并通过因果推理模型（CIM）框架指导AV做出以人为中心的决策，平衡用户幸福感、信任与运营成本。

Conclusion: 该模型在预测用户状态和优化AV决策方面表现出色，为未来人机协同驾驶提供了有效的技术支持。

Abstract: For future human-autonomous vehicle (AV) interactions to be effective and
smooth, human-aware systems that analyze and align human needs with automation
decisions are essential. Achieving this requires systems that account for human
cognitive states. We present a novel computational model in the form of a
Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that infers the cognitive states of both AV
users and other road users, integrating this information into the AV's
decision-making process. Specifically, our model captures the well-being of
both an AV user and an interacting road user as cognitive states alongside
trust. Our DBN models infer beliefs over the AV user's evolving well-being,
trust, and intention states, as well as the possible well-being of other road
users, based on observed interaction experiences. Using data collected from an
interaction study, we refine the model parameters and empirically assess its
performance. Finally, we extend our model into a causal inference model (CIM)
framework for AV decision-making, enabling the AV to enhance user well-being
and trust while balancing these factors with its own operational costs and the
well-being of interacting road users. Our evaluation demonstrates the model's
effectiveness in accurately predicting user's states and guiding informed,
human-centered AV decisions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能统一处理显性规范（如逻辑语言编写的法律）与隐性规范（如神经网络参数中隐含的社会习俗）的方法，导致智能体难以全面实现价值对齐。

Method: 通过监控智能体对规范的遵守情况，计算其声誉值，并以此调整强化学习中的奖励权重，从而激励智能体学习符合规范的行为策略。

Result: 实验证明，在连续状态交通问题中，该方法能有效结合两类规范，找到价值对齐的策略，且联合使用显隐性规范优于单独使用任一类。

Conclusion: 该研究为统一处理多源规范提供了可行框架，验证了整合显隐性规范对智能体价值对齐的必要性和优越性。

Abstract: Our society is governed by a set of norms which together bring about the
values we cherish such as safety, fairness or trustworthiness. The goal of
value-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through
their behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as
laws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social
norms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ.
Safety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some
logical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in
the parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the
literature that could combine these various norm representations into a single
algorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the
reinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with
the given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation.
This quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to
become value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a
continuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the
written and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned
policies. Furthermore, we carry out ablations to demonstrate why it is better
to combine these two groups of norms rather than using either separately.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial
advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often
fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended,
interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address
this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring
real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across
diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource
planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal
mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing
structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid
solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We
also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use,
supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to
generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further
propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as
domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert
perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially
outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable
from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in
open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

Conclusion: lmgame-Bench为LLM能力评估提供标准化方案，揭示了游戏作为复合能力测试工具和跨任务迁移的潜力。

Abstract: Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the
faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We
study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs
and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective
evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity,
and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into
reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and
narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with
lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize
prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show
lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation
analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often
tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement
learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and
to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at

Abstract: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty
estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing
Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling
diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty
estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and
achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method
for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that
combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments
show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but
our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering,
significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed
comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used
to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic
model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.

Abstract: Probabilities of causation are fundamental to modern decision-making. Pearl
first introduced three binary probabilities of causation, and Tian and Pearl
later derived tight bounds for them using Balke's linear programming. The
theoretical characterization of probabilities of causation with multi-valued
treatments and outcomes has remained unresolved for decades, limiting the scope
of causality-based decision-making. In this paper, we resolve this foundational
gap by proposing a complete set of representative probabilities of causation
and proving that they are sufficient to characterize all possible probabilities
of causation within the framework of Structural Causal Models (SCMs). We then
formally derive tight bounds for these representative quantities using formal
mathematical proofs. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our
results through illustrative toy examples.

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在复杂任务上取得了显著进展，但其过度思考的倾向导致了效率低下。本研究旨在探索RL训练的LRMs在节省思考时的内部机制，以提高其效率。

Method: 通过分析思考终止的置信度、从思考到生成的注意力以及输入部分的注意力焦点，研究了三种思考模式：无思考（NT）、显式思考（ET）和隐式思考（IT）。

Result: 研究发现，NT模式减少了输出长度但降低了准确性，而ET和IT模式在保持准确性的同时减少了响应长度。此外，研究还揭示了RL优化的LRMs中存在的基本不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，需要对RL优化的LRMs进行自适应改进，以提高其可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly advanced performance on
complex tasks, yet their tendency to overthink introduces inefficiencies. This
study investigates the internal mechanisms of reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained LRMs when prompted to save thinking, revealing three distinct
thinking modes: no thinking (NT), explicit thinking (ET), and implicit thinking
(IT). Through comprehensive analysis of confidence in thinking termination,
attention from thinking to generation, and attentional focus on input sections,
we uncover key factors influencing the reasoning behaviors. We further find
that NT reduces output length at the cost of accuracy, while ET and IT maintain
accuracy with reduced response length. Our findings expose fundamental
inconsistencies in RL-optimized LRMs, necessitating adaptive improvements for
reliable efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长推理链任务中表现优异，但在简单任务上存在冗余计算问题。研究旨在量化模型在不同模式下的性能上限，并探索其内在的自恢复机制以提升效率。

Method: 提出ASRR框架：1) 基于准确率感知的长度奖励调节机制；2) 根据问题难度自适应分配推理资源；3) 利用模型隐含的自恢复能力补充推理过程。

Result: 实验表明：ASRR在1.5B/7B模型上分别减少32.5%/25.7%计算量，仅损失1.2%/0.6%准确率，安全基准无害率最高提升21.7%。

Conclusion: ASRR证明了通过自适应调节推理长度实现高效、安全推理的可行性，为大型模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long
reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to
redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we
systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and
No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery
Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer
generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery
Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables
implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR
adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty,
achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments
across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR
reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal
accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates
on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of
ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出ClickSight，一种基于大语言模型的流程，用于从学生点击流数据中解读学习策略，评估了不同提示策略和自我优化的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字学习环境中的点击流数据能揭示学生学习行为，但高维度和细粒度使其难以解读。现有方法依赖人工特征或监督模型，缺乏通用性和扩展性。

Method: 引入ClickSight流程，利用大语言模型直接解析原始点击流数据，输入学习策略列表并生成行为解释文本，评估了四种提示策略和自我优化的影响。

Result: 大语言模型能合理从点击流中解读学习策略，但解读质量因提示策略而异，自我优化改进有限。

Conclusion: ClickSight展示了大语言模型从教育交互数据生成理论驱动洞察的潜力，尽管效果受提示策略限制。

Abstract: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights
into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to
their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly
on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models,
therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we
introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline
that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies.
ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input
and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during
interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate
the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans
two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert
evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning
strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting
strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from
educational interaction data.

Motivation: 传统手动设计奖励函数繁琐且易错，而现有基于omega-regular规范的方法多依赖分段折扣奖励，与无限行为轨迹的语义不匹配。

Method: 采用绝对活性规范子类，设计平均奖励目标的无模型RL框架，支持无重置的连续MDP环境和词典序多目标优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为无限时域任务提供理论合理的奖励自动生成方案，推动了形式化规范与强化学习的结合。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have renewed focus on the
design of reward functions that shape agent behavior. Manually designing reward
functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify
behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into
rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given
their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing
methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward
RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the
semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over
infinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the
continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a
single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.
  To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on
absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that
cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to
the continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that
translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our
approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We
also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective
optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the
policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given
omega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown
communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full
knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results
show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms
discount-based methods across benchmarks.

Method: 结合神经特征提取器和基于梯度的辩论结构学习，利用训练数据中的案例进行辩论，支持或攻击不同标签。

Result: Gradual AA-CBR性能接近传统神经网络，显著优于纯符号方法AA-CBR，并提供不确定性评估。

Conclusion: Gradual AA-CBR在保持性能的同时，显著提升了模型的可解释性和功能多样性。

Abstract: We introduce Gradual Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (Gradual
AA-CBR), a data-driven, neurosymbolic classification model in which the outcome
is determined by an argumentation debate structure that is learned
simultaneously with neural-based feature extractors. Each argument in the
debate is an observed case from the training data, favouring their labelling.
Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the
strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based
methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning,
improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs).
Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for
Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class
classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance,
assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and
does not require binary features. We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs
comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming existing AA-CBR
formulations.

Conclusion: 该研究为具有记忆和随机性的复杂系统（如湍流）提供了新的建模工具，奠定了混合学习方法的基础，开辟了神经网络、分数阶微积分和随机分析交叉研究的新方向。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed
to handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. In
this work, we introduce a new class of neural network operators designed to
handle problems where memory effects and randomness play a central role. These
operators merge symmetrized activation functions, Caputo-type fractional
derivatives, and stochastic perturbations introduced via It\^o type noise. The
result is a powerful framework capable of approximating functions that evolve
over time with both long-term memory and uncertain dynamics. We develop the
mathematical foundations of these operators, proving three key theorems of
Voronovskaya type. These results describe the asymptotic behavior of the
operators, their convergence in the mean-square sense, and their consistency
under fractional regularity assumptions. All estimates explicitly account for
the influence of the memory parameter $\alpha$ and the noise level $\sigma$. As
a practical application, we apply the proposed theory to the fractional
Navier-Stokes equations with stochastic forcing, a model often used to describe
turbulence in fluid flows with memory. Our approach provides theoretical
guarantees for the approximation quality and suggests that these neural
operators can serve as effective tools in the analysis and simulation of
complex systems. By blending ideas from neural networks, fractional calculus,
and stochastic analysis, this research opens new perspectives for modeling
turbulent phenomena and other multiscale processes where memory and randomness
are fundamental. The results lay the groundwork for hybrid learning-based
methods with strong analytical backing.

stage taxonomy that traces this progression across manual strategies,
statistical models, classical machine learning, deep learning, and agentic

lens, integrating advances in representation learning, multimodal data fusion,
and tool augmented LLM agents. The strategic shift from static predictors to
contextaware financial agents capable of real time reasoning, scenario
simulation, and cross modal decision making is emphasized. Key challenges in
interpretability, data fragility, governance, and regulatory compliance areas
critical to production deployment are examined. The proposed taxonomy offers a
unified framework for evaluating maturity, aligning infrastructure, and guiding
the responsible development of next generation alpha systems.

Result: TTC在准确率/能耗效率上超越传统模型扩展，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现显著。

Conclusion: TTC是一种可持续且高效的方向，可在不增加预训练成本的情况下提升模型部署效果。

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet
it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work
introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational
resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling
strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve
superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size.
Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in
accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex
reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical
interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating
that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to
query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate
for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and
adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional
pretraining costs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为LMHR的框架，通过增强时空图神经网络（STGNN）来改进多元时间序列（MTS）预测，重点关注长期时空依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数STGNN方法受限于计算复杂度，主要关注短期和局部时空依赖关系，忽略了长期时空相似性和相关性，这对准确预测至关重要。

Method: LMHR框架包含三个主要组件：长期历史编码器（LHEncoder）用于编码长期历史数据并减少噪声；非参数分层表示检索器（HRetriever）用于建模长期时空依赖关系；基于Transformer的聚合器（TAggregator）用于选择性融合检索到的表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，LMHR在平均预测水平上比典型STGNN方法提高了10.72%，在多个真实数据集上比现有最优方法提高了4.12%，并且在快速变化模式上的预测准确性持续提高了9.8%。

Conclusion: LMHR框架通过有效建模长期时空依赖关系，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的准确性，尤其在处理快速变化模式时表现突出。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural
Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal
correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS
forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal
dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate
history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal
similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate
forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term
Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting.
Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively
encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and
reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation
Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the
long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable
representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator
(TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual
representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently.
Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72%
on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on
several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction
accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于去噪扩散概率模型训练过程中的随机性和损失函数本身难以评估生成数据的质量，因此需要一种方法来监控和优化训练过程。

Method: 论文通过检查多种相似性度量并改进现有度量，监控训练和合成过程，并针对分类任务需求对度量进行微调。

Result: 显著减少了训练周期数量，同时未降低分类任务的性能，优化了训练过程并节省了资源。

Conclusion: 优化的训练过程不仅节省了资源，还减少了生成模型的训练时间，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are able to generate synthetic
sensor signals. The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss
function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the
forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This
enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the
process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality
of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an
existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and
synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be
fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying
classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of
training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An
optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time
for training generative models.

Conclusion: ParaStep是一种可扩展且通信高效的解决方案，特别适用于带宽受限环境下的扩散模型加速。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models across
various modalities, including image, video, and audio synthesis. However, their
deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to
the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process. While existing
parallelization strategies attempt to accelerate inference by distributing
computation across multiple devices, they typically incur high communication
overhead, hindering deployment on commercial hardware. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based
on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by
exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs
lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep
achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \textbf{3.88}$\times$ on SVD,
\textbf{2.43}$\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \textbf{6.56}$\times$ on
AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality. These results highlight
ParaStep as a scalable and communication-efficient solution for accelerating
diffusion inference, particularly in bandwidth-constrained environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在资源受限设备上部署时，计算和内存需求过高，现有量化方法难以平衡性能与开销。

Method: 基于异常值空间稳定性假设(OSSH)，提出Quaff框架，通过目标动量缩放优化低精度激活表示，动态抑制异常值。

Result: 在GPQA基准测试中，Quaff降低1.73倍延迟，节省30%内存，同时准确率提升0.6%。

Conclusion: Quaff实现了效率、性能和可部署性的三重平衡，使消费级GPU微调成为可能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various
domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains
hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific
fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing
methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high
computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a
critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning,
certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across
training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision
activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically
suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight
operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling
while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks
validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA
reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory
savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the
Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance,
and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080
Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM
deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/Little0o0/Quaff.git.

Abstract: Composites are amongst the most important materials manufactured today, as
evidenced by their use in countless applications. In order to establish the
suitability of composites in specific applications, finite element (FE)
modelling, a numerical method based on partial differential equations, is the
industry standard for assessing their mechanical properties. However, FE
modelling is exceptionally costly from a computational viewpoint, a limitation
which has led to efforts towards applying AI models to this task. However, in
these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward
neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting
elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits;
and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users. In this
paper, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equipped with methods
from explainable AI (XAI) can be successfully deployed to solve this problem.
Our approach uses customised CNNs trained on a dataset we generate using
transverse tension tests in FE modelling to predict composites' mechanical
properties, i.e., Young's modulus and yield strength. We show empirically that
our approach achieves high accuracy, outperforming a baseline, ResNet-34, in
estimating the mechanical properties. We then use SHAP and Integrated
Gradients, two post-hoc XAI methods, to explain the predictions, showing that
the CNNs use the critical geometrical features that influence the composites'
behaviour, thus allowing engineers to verify that the models are trustworthy by
representing the science of composites.

Abstract: GraphSAGE is a widely used graph neural network. The introduction of causal
inference has improved its robust performance and named as Causal GraphSAGE.
However, Causal GraphSAGE focuses on measuring causal weighting among
individual nodes, but neglecting the cooperative relationships among sampling
nodes as a whole. To address this issue, this paper proposes Cooperative Causal
GraphSAGE (CoCa-GraphSAGE), which combines cooperative game theory with Causal
GraphSAGE. Initially, a cooperative causal structure model is constructed in
the case of cooperation based on the graph structure. Subsequently, Cooperative
Causal sampling (CoCa-sampling) algorithm is proposed, employing the Shapley
values to calculate the cooperative contribution based on causal weights of the
nodes sets. CoCa-sampling guides the selection of nodes with significant
cooperative causal effects during the neighborhood sampling process, thus
integrating the selected neighborhood features under cooperative relationships,
which takes the sampled nodes as a whole and generates more stable target node
embeddings. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed
method has comparable classification performance to the compared methods and
outperforms under perturbations, demonstrating the robustness improvement by
CoCa-sampling.

Conclusion: 通过循环优化模型和数据，该方法有效提升了深度神经网络的训练效果和泛化能力，为传统训练范式提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various
domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a
challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the
model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional
training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive
Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the
input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some
refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce
improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation
framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's
parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively
addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only
mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also
demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data that faithfully captures the statistical structure
of real-world distributions is a fundamental challenge in data modeling.
Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual
structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains.
Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) reveals their potential as
flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when
applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient,
constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment.
Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis
that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional
feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for
modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to
generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency
without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary
statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data
while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We
evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using
heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce,
population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured
formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical
fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a
valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在低数据环境下表现出色，但其缺乏显式代理建模和校准不确定性，以及内部机制不透明，导致在优化过程中难以平衡探索与开发，影响理论可追踪性和可靠性。

Method: LLINBO框架通过三种机制实现LLMs与统计代理专家（如高斯过程）的协作，结合LLMs的上下文推理能力和统计模型的理论保证。

Conclusion: LLINBO通过结合LLMs和统计模型的优势，提供了一种可靠且高效的贝叶斯优化方法，适用于昂贵黑盒函数的优化问题。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used
for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them
promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge
to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as
optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate
modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque
internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize
or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining
theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO:
LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with
statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core
philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early
exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient
exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this
collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with
a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to
reproduce the results can be found at

TL;DR: 该研究开发深度学习模型，仅使用非临床数据预测急诊科6小时后滞留患者数，N-BEATSx模型表现最佳，误差低且稳定性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过预测急诊科滞留患者数量，支持医院提前进行运营决策，缓解急诊科拥挤问题。

Method: 整合急诊追踪系统、住院记录、天气等5类数据，经特征工程处理后，使用tsai库中的多种时间序列深度学习模型进行训练和超参数调优。

Result: N-BEATSx模型表现最优，平均绝对误差2.10，决定系数0.95，在极端高负荷情况下仍保持稳定预测能力。

Conclusion: 无需临床数据即可实现高精度预测，该框架为医院提供了可推广的急诊滞留预警方案。

Abstract: This study develops deep learning models to forecast the number of patients
in the emergency department (ED) boarding phase six hours in advance, aiming to
support proactive operational decision-making using only non-clinical,
operational, and contextual features. Data were collected from five sources: ED
tracking systems, inpatient census records, weather reports, federal holiday
calendars, and local event schedules. After feature engineering, the data were
aggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for
model training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus,
TSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using
Optuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count
was 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best
performance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08,
root mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95.
The model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high
boarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard
deviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts
are achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong
performance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of
additional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions.
This framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital
systems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding.

Method: 将参数训练过程建模为受玻尔兹曼输运方程(BTE)控制的粒子系统演化，通过数值模拟粒子随机碰撞实现参数更新，物理机制自然促进参数多样性。

Conclusion: 基于物理动力学的KO优化器通过模拟粒子碰撞机制有效防止参数坍缩，为神经网络优化提供了新的理论框架和实践方案。

Abstract: The design of optimization algorithms for neural networks remains a critical
challenge, with most existing methods relying on heuristic adaptations of
gradient-based approaches. This paper introduces KO (Kinetics-inspired
Optimizer), a novel neural optimizer inspired by kinetic theory and partial
differential equation (PDE) simulations. We reimagine the training dynamics of
network parameters as the evolution of a particle system governed by kinetic
principles, where parameter updates are simulated via a numerical scheme for
the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) that models stochastic particle
collisions. This physics-driven approach inherently promotes parameter
diversity during optimization, mitigating the phenomenon of parameter
condensation, i.e. collapse of network parameters into low-dimensional
subspaces, through mechanisms analogous to thermal diffusion in physical
systems. We analyze this property, establishing both a mathematical proof and a
physical interpretation. Extensive experiments on image classification
(CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and text classification (IMDB, Snips) tasks
demonstrate that KO consistently outperforms baseline optimizers (e.g., Adam,
SGD), achieving accuracy improvements while computation cost remains
comparable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据工程管道需要大量工程时间和领域专业知识，处理数据时面临高成本和复杂性。ADEPT旨在通过自动化简化这一过程。

Method: ADEPT采用两步法：1) 利用文本嵌入表示多样化数据源；2) 构建变分信息瓶颈准则以减少时间序列文本嵌入的熵方差。

Result: 实验表明，ADEPT在医疗、金融、科学和工业物联网等多个领域的大规模数据集上表现优于现有最佳基准。

Conclusion: ADEPT能够跳过传统数据管道的多个步骤，为高效、可扩展的数据科学应用自动化铺平了道路。

Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are essential - albeit costly - components of
predictive analytics frameworks requiring significant engineering time and
domain expertise for carrying out tasks such as data ingestion, preprocessing,
feature extraction, and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose ADEPT,
an automated data engineering pipeline via text embeddings. At the core of the
ADEPT framework is a simple yet powerful idea that the entropy of embeddings
corresponding to textually dense raw format representation of time series can
be intuitively viewed as equivalent (or in many cases superior) to that of
numerically dense vector representations obtained by data engineering
pipelines. Consequently, ADEPT uses a two step approach that (i) leverages text
embeddings to represent the diverse data sources, and (ii) constructs a
variational information bottleneck criteria to mitigate entropy variance in
text embeddings of time series data. ADEPT provides an end-to-end automated
implementation of predictive models that offers superior predictive performance
despite issues such as missing data, ill-formed records, improper or corrupted
data formats and irregular timestamps. Through exhaustive experiments, we show
that the ADEPT outperforms the best existing benchmarks in a diverse set of
datasets from large-scale applications across healthcare, finance, science and
industrial internet of things. Our results show that ADEPT can potentially
leapfrog many conventional data pipeline steps thereby paving the way for
efficient and scalable automation pathways for diverse data science
applications.

Motivation: 现有生存模型缺乏可靠的不确定性量化，限制了其在临床决策等敏感领域的应用。

Method: 基于元模型的框架SurvUnc，采用锚定学习策略，整合一致性知识进行不确定性估计，且模型无关。

Result: 在多个公开数据集和代表性模型上验证了SurvUnc在选择性预测、错误预测检测等方面的优越性。

Conclusion: SurvUnc有效提升了生存模型的解释性和可靠性，为实际应用提供了更可信的预测。

Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over
time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications,
particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment.
Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of
predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack
of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and
trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical
decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this
work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc
uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an
anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into
meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate
uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring
compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its
architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a
comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked
problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking
datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the
superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including
selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival
predictions in real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统模仿学习假设演示接近最优，但人类行为往往基于个人满意标准而非最优性。论文旨在解决这一差距，提出更符合人类行为模式的模仿学习方法。

Method: 采用基于边际的目标函数引导深度强化学习，通过超越演示者的期望水平（定义在轨迹或部分轨迹上）来优化策略，无需显式学习这些期望。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更好地模仿高质量演示部分，显著提高演示者的接受率，并在多种环境中取得有竞争力的真实回报。

Conclusion: 基于满意理论的模仿学习方法能有效提升策略质量，更符合人类行为模式，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Imitation learning often assumes that demonstrations are close to optimal
according to some fixed, but unknown, cost function. However, according to
satisficing theory, humans often choose acceptable behavior based on their
personal (and potentially dynamic) levels of aspiration, rather than achieving
(near-) optimality. For example, a lunar lander demonstration that successfully
lands without crashing might be acceptable to a novice despite being slow or
jerky. Using a margin-based objective to guide deep reinforcement learning, our
focused satisficing approach to imitation learning seeks a policy that
surpasses the demonstrator's aspiration levels -- defined over trajectories or
portions of trajectories -- on unseen demonstrations without explicitly
learning those aspirations. We show experimentally that this focuses the policy
to imitate the highest quality (portions of) demonstrations better than
existing imitation learning methods, providing much higher rates of guaranteed
acceptability to the demonstrator, and competitive true returns on a range of
environments.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a principled framework
for sequential decision-making in environments where interactions evolve
continuously over time. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of CTRL remains limited, especially in settings with general
function approximation. In this work, we propose a model-based CTRL algorithm
that achieves both sample and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages
optimism-based confidence sets to establish the first sample complexity
guarantee for CTRL with general function approximation, showing that a
near-optimal policy can be learned with a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{R}} + d_{\mathcal{F}}}N^{-1/2})$ using $N$
measurements, where $d_{\mathcal{R}}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ denote the
distributional Eluder dimensions of the reward and dynamic functions,
respectively, capturing the complexity of general function approximation in
reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce structured policy updates and an
alternative measurement strategy that significantly reduce the number of policy
updates and rollouts while maintaining competitive sample efficiency. We
implemented experiments to backup our proposed algorithms on continuous control
tasks and diffusion model fine-tuning, demonstrating comparable performance
with significantly fewer policy updates and rollouts.

Motivation: 传统时间序列方法仅能揭示时间平均意义上的因果关系，而基于信息传递的集成方法通常局限于低维系统。ACI旨在解决这些限制，提供更灵活和动态的因果推断方法。

Method: ACI利用动态系统和状态变量的单次实现，通过贝叶斯数据同化逆向识别瞬时因果关系及其动态影响范围（CIR）。

Result: ACI能够动态捕捉变量间的相互作用，适用于高维问题、短时间序列和不完整数据集，且无需观测潜在原因变量。

Conclusion: ACI是一种高效、灵活的因果推断框架，特别适用于复杂动态系统中的间歇性和极端事件分析。

Abstract: Causal inference determines cause-and-effect relationships between variables
and has broad applications across disciplines. Traditional time-series methods
often reveal causal links only in a time-averaged sense, while ensemble-based
information transfer approaches detect the time evolution of short-term causal
relationships but are typically limited to low-dimensional systems. In this
paper, a new causal inference framework, called assimilative causal inference
(ACI), is developed. Fundamentally different from the state-of-the-art methods,
ACI uses a dynamical system and a single realization of a subset of the state
variables to identify instantaneous causal relationships and the dynamic
evolution of the associated causal influence range (CIR). Instead of
quantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an
inverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward
from observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is
determined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect
variables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables.
ACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of
variables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over
time. Second, a mathematically justified objective criterion determines the CIR
without empirical thresholds. Third, ACI is scalable to high-dimensional
problems by leveraging computationally efficient Bayesian data assimilation
techniques. Finally, ACI applies to short time series and incomplete datasets.
Notably, ACI does not require observations of candidate causes, which is a key
advantage since potential drivers are often unknown or unmeasured. The
effectiveness of ACI is demonstrated by complex dynamical systems showcasing
intermittency and extreme events.

Conclusion: 通过选择信息量最大的训练子集，该方法显著提高了监督微调的统计效率，为LLM的领域适应提供了一种高效且可分析的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to adapting large
language models (LLMs) to new domains. In this work, we improve the statistical
efficiency of SFT by selecting an informative subset of training examples.
Specifically, for a fixed budget of training examples, which determines the
computational cost of fine-tuning, we determine the most informative ones. The
key idea in our method is to select examples that maximize information gain,
measured by the Hessian of the log-likelihood of the LLM. We approximate it
efficiently by linearizing the LLM at the last layer using multinomial logistic
regression models. Our approach is computationally efficient, analyzable, and
performs well empirically. We demonstrate this on several problems, and back
our claims with both quantitative results and an LLM evaluation.

Conclusion: Kausal算法通过融合深度学习和Koopman理论，有效解决了非线性动态系统中的因果发现问题，为复杂系统分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We use a deep Koopman operator-theoretic formalism to develop a novel causal
discovery algorithm, Kausal. Causal discovery aims to identify cause-effect
mechanisms for better scientific understanding, explainable decision-making,
and more accurate modeling. Standard statistical frameworks, such as Granger
causality, lack the ability to quantify causal relationships in nonlinear
dynamics due to the presence of complex feedback mechanisms, timescale mixing,
and nonstationarity. This presents a challenge in studying many real-world
systems, such as the Earth's climate. Meanwhile, Koopman operator methods have
emerged as a promising tool for approximating nonlinear dynamics in a linear
space of observables. In Kausal, we propose to leverage this powerful idea for
causal analysis where optimal observables are inferred using deep learning.
Causal estimates are then evaluated in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and
defined as the distance between the marginal dynamics of the effect and the
joint dynamics of the cause-effect observables. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate Kausal's superior ability in discovering and characterizing causal
signals compared to existing approaches of prescribed observables. Lastly, we
extend our analysis to observations of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation
highlighting our algorithm's applicability to real-world phenomena. Our code is

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Transformer architecture, the standard
algorithm for computing Attention suffers from quadratic time complexity in
context length $n$. Alman and Song [NeurIPS 2023] showed that when the head
dimension $d = \Theta(\log n)$, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only
if the inputs have small entries bounded by $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$ in absolute
values, under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$).
Equivalently, subquadratic Attention is possible if and only if the softmax is
applied with high temperature for $d=\Theta(\log n)$. Running times of these
algorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a
polynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.
  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed
efficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention
algorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we
resolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary
temperatures is possible. First, for all constant $d = O(1)$, we give the first
subquadratic $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - 1/d} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(B))$ time algorithm
for Attention with large $B$. Our result holds even for matrices with large
head dimension if they have low rank. In this regime, we also give a similar
running time for Attention gradient computation, and therefore for the full LLM
training process. Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our
algorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d =
2^{\Theta(\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under
$\mathsf{SETH}$.
  Finally, in the regime where $d = \mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the
standard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity
assumptions.

Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied
and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the
adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have
achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a
large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which
can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models
learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is
not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same
catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely
overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable
star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This
process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space
variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data
Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a
generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light
curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate
underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted
under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach
outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on
biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.

Motivation: 研究在多组未知数据分布下，如何公平且高效地动态收集数据以估计各组均值，适用于在线平台实验和自适应临床试验。

Method: 采用主动学习框架，通过带反馈的bandit方法动态选择采样组，使用Variance-UCB算法基于方差估计的上置信界选择下一组。

Result: 提出的Variance-UCB算法显著改进了现有方法的遗憾上界，适用于多种分布和目标。

Conclusion: Variance-UCB算法在动态采样中能有效减少估计方差，提升公平性和效率。

Abstract: We study a fundamental learning problem over multiple groups with unknown
data distributions, where an analyst would like to learn the mean of each
group. Moreover, we want to ensure that this data is collected in a relatively
fair manner such that the noise of the estimate of each group is reasonable. In
particular, we focus on settings where data are collected dynamically, which is
important in adaptive experimentation for online platforms or adaptive clinical
trials for healthcare. In our model, we employ an active learning framework to
sequentially collect samples with bandit feedback, observing a sample in each
period from the chosen group. After observing a sample, the analyst updates
their estimate of the mean and variance of that group and chooses the next
group accordingly. The analyst's objective is to dynamically collect samples to
minimize the collective noise of the estimators, measured by the norm of the
vector of variances of the mean estimators.
  We propose an algorithm, Variance-UCB, that sequentially selects groups
according to an upper confidence bound on the variance estimate. We provide a
general theoretical framework for providing efficient bounds on learning from
any underlying distribution where the variances can be estimated reasonably.
This framework yields upper bounds on regret that improve significantly upon
all existing bounds, as well as a collection of new results for different
objectives and distributions than those previously studied.

TL;DR: 提出Polar Sparsity方法，通过动态稀疏化注意力层和MLP层，显著加速大语言模型推理，适用于高吞吐场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文稀疏方法在大批量处理时因激活神经元联合计算而失效，需开发能扩展到大batch size的高效稀疏推理方案。

Method: 发现注意力层稀疏性稳定且与batch无关，开发硬件优化的稀疏GPU内核，针对性处理MLP和注意力层的选择性计算。

Result: 在OPT/LLaMA等模型上实现2.2倍端到端加速，保持精度，首次证明上下文稀疏可扩展至大批量场景。

Conclusion: Polar Sparsity以最小改动实现高效推理加速，适用于大规模高吞吐LLM部署系统。

Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world
deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity,
where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model
parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union
of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar
Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention
layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more
compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast,
attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head
sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient,
sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations,
delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2
\& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that
contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering
substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity
practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is

*Hootan Mahmoodiyan,Maryam Ahang,Mostafa Abbasi,Homayoun Najjaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征加权的领域自适应技术（MCW），用于提升电力变压器故障诊断的准确性，解决了传统方法和机器学习模型在跨变压器应用时的分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力变压器的可靠运行对电网稳定至关重要。溶解气体分析（DGA）是常用的故障诊断方法，但传统方法依赖启发式规则，结果不一致。机器学习方法虽提高了准确性，但变压器类型、环境因素和运行条件的差异导致诊断数据分布偏移，直接模型迁移常失败，因此需要领域自适应技术。

Method: 提出了一种结合最大均值差异（MMD）和相关对齐（CORAL）的特征加权领域自适应技术（MCW），利用Kolmogorov-Smirnov（K-S）统计量分配自适应权重，优先处理分布差异较大的特征，从而改善源域和目标域的对齐。

Result: 在电力变压器数据集上的实验表明，该方法比微调技术提高了7.9%，比MMD-CORAL（MC）提高了2.2%，且在不同训练样本量下均表现优异，证实了其在领域自适应中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCW方法有效解决了电力变压器故障诊断中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了诊断准确性，适用于不同变压器类型和运行条件，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring the reliable operation of power transformers is critical to grid
stability. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is widely used for fault diagnosis, but
traditional methods rely on heuristic rules, which may lead to inconsistent
results. Machine learning (ML)-based approaches have improved diagnostic
accuracy; however, power transformers operate under varying conditions, and
differences in transformer type, environmental factors, and operational
settings create distribution shifts in diagnostic data. Consequently, direct
model transfer between transformers often fails, making techniques for domain
adaptation a necessity. To tackle this issue, this work proposes a
feature-weighted domain adaptation technique that combines Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) and Correlation Alignment (CORAL) with feature-specific
weighting (MCW). Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistics are used to assign
adaptable weights, prioritizing features with larger distributional
discrepancies and thereby improving source and target domain alignment.
Experimental evaluations on datasets for power transformers demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves a 7.9% improvement over
Fine-Tuning and a 2.2% improvement over MMD-CORAL (MC). Furthermore, it
outperforms both techniques across various training sample sizes, confirming
its robustness for domain adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合小波去噪、小波包分解和多通道Swin Transformer的新框架MCSFormer，用于精确预测滚动轴承的剩余使用寿命（RUL），在噪声抵抗、泛化能力和安全性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动轴承的剩余使用寿命（RUL）精确预测对避免意外故障、减少停机时间以及提升工业系统的安全性和效率至关重要。然而，降解趋势的复杂性、噪声的存在以及提前检测故障的需求使得RUL预测成为一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 论文提出了一种新颖的框架，结合了小波去噪方法、小波包分解（WPD）和定制的多通道Swin Transformer模型（MCSFormer）。该模型通过注意力机制进行特征融合，利用分层表示学习全局和局部降解模式。此外，还开发了一种定制损失函数，以区分早期和晚期预测，优先考虑准确的早期检测并最小化晚期预测的高操作风险。

Result: 在PRONOSTIA数据集上的实验表明，MCSFormer在内部条件实验中优于现有技术模型（如Adaptive Transformer、MDAN和CNN-SRU），平均MAE降低了41%、64%和69%。在跨条件测试中，其泛化能力优于改进的ViT和Swin Transformer。定制损失函数有效减少了晚期预测，评分指标提高了6.3%，同时保持了整体性能的竞争力。

Conclusion: MCSFormer凭借其强大的噪声抵抗能力、泛化能力和对安全性的关注，成为工业应用中值得信赖且有效的预测性维护工具。

Abstract: Precise estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of rolling bearings is
an important consideration to avoid unexpected failures, reduce downtime, and
promote safety and efficiency in industrial systems. Complications in
degradation trends, noise presence, and the necessity to detect faults in
advance make estimation of RUL a challenging task. This paper introduces a
novel framework that combines wavelet-based denoising method, Wavelet Packet
Decomposition (WPD), and a customized multi-channel Swin Transformer model
(MCSFormer) to address these problems. With attention mechanisms incorporated
for feature fusion, the model is designed to learn global and local degradation
patterns utilizing hierarchical representations for enhancing predictive
performance. Additionally, a customized loss function is developed as a key
distinction of this work to differentiate between early and late predictions,
prioritizing accurate early detection and minimizing the high operation risks
of late predictions. The proposed model was evaluated with the PRONOSTIA
dataset using three experiments. Intra-condition experiments demonstrated that
MCSFormer outperformed state-of-the-art models, including the Adaptive
Transformer, MDAN, and CNN-SRU, achieving 41%, 64%, and 69% lower MAE on
average across different operating conditions, respectively. In terms of
cross-condition testing, it achieved superior generalization under varying
operating conditions compared to the adapted ViT and Swin Transformer. Lastly,
the custom loss function effectively reduced late predictions, as evidenced in
a 6.3% improvement in the scoring metric while maintaining competitive overall
performance. The model's robust noise resistance, generalization capability,
and focus on safety make MCSFormer a trustworthy and effective predictive
maintenance tool in industrial applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现实世界中机器学习模型面临数据持续且不可预测的演变，现有方法无法全面解决何时重新训练模型的问题，尤其是在信息有限、分布变化未知且成本权衡难以量化的情况下。

Result: 在7个数据集上的分类任务实验中，该方法一致优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法为机器学习模型在数据持续变化环境中的重新训练问题提供了全面且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A significant challenge in maintaining real-world machine learning models is
responding to the continuous and unpredictable evolution of data. Most
practitioners are faced with the difficult question: when should I retrain or
update my machine learning model? This seemingly straightforward problem is
particularly challenging for three reasons: 1) decisions must be made based on
very limited information - we usually have access to only a few examples, 2)
the nature, extent, and impact of the distribution shift are unknown, and 3) it
involves specifying a cost ratio between retraining and poor performance, which
can be hard to characterize. Existing works address certain aspects of this
problem, but none offer a comprehensive solution. Distribution shift detection
falls short as it cannot account for the cost trade-off; the scarcity of the
data, paired with its unusual structure, makes it a poor fit for existing
offline reinforcement learning methods, and the online learning formulation
overlooks key practical considerations. To address this, we present a
principled formulation of the retraining problem and propose an
uncertainty-based method that makes decisions by continually forecasting the
evolution of model performance evaluated with a bounded metric. Our experiments
addressing classification tasks show that the method consistently outperforms
existing baselines on 7 datasets.

Abstract: Accurately predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is
essential for understanding disease mechanisms and designing effective
therapies. Yet exhaustively exploring the space of possible perturbations
(e.g., multi-gene perturbations or across tissues and cell types) is
prohibitively expensive, motivating methods that can generalize to unseen
conditions. In this work, we explore how knowledge graphs of gene-gene
relationships can improve out-of-distribution (OOD) prediction across three
challenging settings: unseen single perturbations; unseen double perturbations;
and unseen cell lines. In particular, we present: (i) TxPert, a new
state-of-the-art method that leverages multiple biological knowledge networks
to predict transcriptional responses under OOD scenarios; (ii) an in-depth
analysis demonstrating the impact of graphs, model architecture, and data on
performance; and (iii) an expanded benchmarking framework that strengthens
evaluation standards for perturbation modeling.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability and safety of machine learning models in open-world
deployment is a central challenge in AI safety. This thesis develops both
algorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues
arising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard
neural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).
  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM),
assume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to
overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis
introduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy
and reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an
unknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle
novel inputs without labeled OOD data.
  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to
generate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present
SAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled
in-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment
conditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be
harnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal
reliability guarantees.
  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop
HaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against
malicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise
human feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that
threaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.
  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new
paradigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal
human efforts.

feedback about the accessibility of potentially concerning behaviors in a way
that may scale to powerful future models, including those which may otherwise
be capable of deceptive alignment. An evaluation framework using soft prompts
is demonstrated in natural language, chess, and pathfinding, and the technique
is extended with generalized conditional soft prompts to aid in constructing
task evaluations.

Abstract: The growing enforcement of the right to be forgotten regulations has
propelled recent advances in certified (graph) unlearning strategies to comply
with data removal requests from deployed machine learning (ML) models.
Motivated by the well-documented bias amplification predicament inherent to
graph data, here we take a fresh look at graph unlearning and leverage it as a
bias mitigation tool. Given a pre-trained graph ML model, we develop a
training-free unlearning procedure that offers certifiable bias mitigation via
a single-step Newton update on the model weights. This way, we contribute a
computationally lightweight alternative to the prevalent training- and
optimization-based fairness enhancement approaches, with quantifiable
performance guarantees. We first develop a novel fairness-aware nodal feature
unlearning strategy along with refined certified unlearning bounds for this
setting, whose impact extends beyond the realm of graph unlearning. We then
design structural unlearning methods endowed with principled selection
mechanisms over nodes and edges informed by rigorous bias analyses. Unlearning
these judiciously selected elements can mitigate algorithmic biases with
minimal impact on downstream utility (e.g., node classification accuracy).
Experimental results over real networks corroborate the bias mitigation
efficacy of our unlearning strategies, and delineate markedly favorable
utility-complexity trade-offs relative to retraining from scratch using
augmented graph data obtained via removals.

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate
(CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction.
This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user
privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face
obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion
data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data
clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables
collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the
advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components:
(1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level
gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce
communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model
under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite
privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on
industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC
performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying
with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This
framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance
CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为smart-sizing的数据标注策略，通过强调标签多样性、模型引导选择和边际效用停止，实现在高后果领域中用更少标注数据训练出更鲁棒的AI模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高后果领域（如国防、情报和灾难响应）中，AI系统需要在资源受限的情况下检测罕见但影响重大的事件。传统标注策略注重标注数量而非信息价值，导致冗余和噪声，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 论文提出了smart-sizing策略，通过自适应标签优化（ALO）实现，结合预标注分类、标注者分歧分析和迭代反馈，优先选择能显著提升模型性能的标签。

Result: 实验表明，使用20%到40%的精选数据训练的模型可以匹配或超过使用全部数据的基线模型，尤其是在罕见类召回和边缘案例泛化方面。同时，论文揭示了训练和验证集中的潜在标注错误如何扭曲评估结果。

Conclusion: smart-sizing将标注重新定义为与任务结果对齐的反馈驱动过程，能够用更少的标签训练出更鲁棒的模型，并为前沿模型和操作系统的AI开发流程提供支持。

Abstract: AI systems in high-consequence domains such as defense, intelligence, and
disaster response must detect rare, high-impact events while operating under
tight resource constraints. Traditional annotation strategies that prioritize
label volume over informational value introduce redundancy and noise, limiting
model generalization. This paper introduces smart-sizing, a training data
strategy that emphasizes label diversity, model-guided selection, and marginal
utility-based stopping. We implement this through Adaptive Label Optimization
(ALO), combining pre-labeling triage, annotator disagreement analysis, and
iterative feedback to prioritize labels that meaningfully improve model
performance. Experiments show that models trained on 20 to 40 percent of
curated data can match or exceed full-data baselines, particularly in
rare-class recall and edge-case generalization. We also demonstrate how latent
labeling errors embedded in training and validation sets can distort
evaluation, underscoring the need for embedded audit tools and
performance-aware governance. Smart-sizing reframes annotation as a
feedback-driven process aligned with mission outcomes, enabling more robust
models with fewer labels and supporting efficient AI development pipelines for
frontier models and operational systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异常检测任务中优于现有技术，并能高精度检测多种异常类型。

Conclusion: 提取关键路径并集成多路径检测结果是一种有效的DNN异常检测方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notoriously hard to understand and difficult
to defend. Extracting representative paths (including the neuron activation
values and the connections between neurons) from DNNs using software
engineering approaches has recently shown to be a promising approach in
interpreting the decision making process of blackbox DNNs, as the extracted
paths are often effective in capturing essential features. With this in mind,
this work investigates a novel approach that extracts critical paths from DNNs
and subsequently applies the extracted paths for the anomaly detection task,
based on the observation that outliers and adversarial inputs do not usually
induce the same activation pattern on those paths as normal (in-distribution)
inputs.
  In our approach, we first identify critical detection paths via genetic
evolution and mutation. Since different paths in a DNN often capture different
features for the same target class, we ensemble detection results from multiple
paths by integrating random subspace sampling and a voting mechanism. Compared
with state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results suggest that our method
not only outperforms them, but it is also suitable for the detection of a broad
range of anomaly types with high accuracy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a technique to leverage hardware concurrency to
improve the efficiency of large-scale autoregressive (AR) Transformer models by
enabling multiple steps of token generation in a single forward pass.
State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers,
since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process
tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise
thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to
SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification
methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently.
We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative
decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and
Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition
matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead to
current SSM state update implementations. With the algorithm, we describe a
hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer
tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform
vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and
tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for
further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference. Code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

*John L. Zhou,Jonathan C. Kao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无需分层结构的离线目标条件强化学习算法，通过子目标策略自举实现长视野任务的高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层强化学习方法在长视野任务中依赖模块化子策略和子目标生成，导致复杂度过高且难以扩展到高维目标空间。

Method: 采用基于优势加权重要性采样的子目标条件策略自举方法，避免对（子）目标空间的生成模型依赖。

Result: 在状态和像素级控制基准测试中，性能匹配或超越现有离线GCRL方法，并能处理传统方法失效的复杂长视野任务。

Conclusion: 该非分层方法通过策略自举简化了训练流程，同时在高维控制任务中展现出卓越的扩展性。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising
approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free
trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation
models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling
GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse
rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive
actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong
empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on
modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces
significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal
spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat
(non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on
subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our
approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space,
which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state
spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based
approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across
a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation
benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL
algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches
fail.

TL;DR: 论文提出EORM模型，通过轻量级后验验证提升大语言模型数学推理的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学推理中常因多步逻辑一致性不足而表现不佳，现有方法如思维链提示虽能引导推理步骤，但无法保证正确性，且通过大量采样提升可靠性计算成本高。

Method: 引入基于能量模型的EORM，仅需结果标签即可训练奖励模型，通过标量能量评分对思维链解决方案进行排序，隐式偏好连贯推理。

Conclusion: EORM通过高效后验验证流程，有效提升大语言模型推理结果的可靠性，且计算成本低。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee
correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is
computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model
(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy
Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to
assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,
thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting
discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking
candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final
outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks
(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with
Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively
leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the
performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome
reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类通过避免不确定预测提高模型可靠性，但现有方法在协变量偏移场景下研究不足。

Method: 基于Neyman-Pearson引理构建似然比检验的选择函数，统一现有基线并创新方法。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务（包括监督学习和视觉-语言模型）中，新方法持续超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 似然比选择机制能有效提升协变量偏移下的选择性分类性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Selective classification enhances the reliability of predictive models by
allowing them to abstain from making uncertain predictions. In this work, we
revisit the design of optimal selection functions through the lens of the
Neyman--Pearson lemma, a classical result in statistics that characterizes the
optimal rejection rule as a likelihood ratio test. We show that this
perspective not only unifies the behavior of several post-hoc selection
baselines, but also motivates new approaches to selective classification which
we propose here. A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift,
where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This
realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the
context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a
range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and
vision-language models. Our experiments demonstrate that our
Neyman--Pearson-informed methods consistently outperform existing baselines,
indicating that likelihood ratio-based selection offers a robust mechanism for
improving selective classification under covariate shifts. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/clear-nus/sc-likelihood-ratios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注无限样本或首次梯度步的上下文推理行为，缺乏对收敛速率和泛化能力的理解。本文旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 通过有限样本分析，研究单层Transformer在梯度下降训练下的期望损失收敛行为，并验证其泛化能力。

Result: 证明存在一类单层Transformer在理论和实验上均达到贝叶斯最优，且训练模型能线性收敛到贝叶斯风险，并展现出与先前实证观察一致的学习行为。

Conclusion: 本文理论发现得到广泛实验验证，为单层Transformer在上下文推理中的能力提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the approximation capabilities and on-convergence behaviors of
one-layer transformers on the noiseless and noisy in-context reasoning of
next-token prediction. Existing theoretical results focus on understanding the
in-context reasoning behaviors for either the first gradient step or when the
number of samples is infinite. Furthermore, no convergence rates nor
generalization abilities were known. Our work addresses these gaps by showing
that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably
Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention. When being trained with
gradient descent, we show via a finite-sample analysis that the expected loss
of these transformers converges at linear rate to the Bayes risk. Moreover, we
prove that the trained models generalize to unseen samples as well as exhibit
learning behaviors that were empirically observed in previous works. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by extensive empirical validations.

TL;DR: MSH-GNN提出了一种多尺度谐波图神经网络，通过节点特定的谐波投影实现特征级自适应消息传递，显著提升了图分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNNs）将邻居嵌入作为整体向量聚合，缺乏识别细粒度和方向特定特征相关性的能力。

Method: MSH-GNN通过动态将邻居特征投影到目标节点表示确定的频率敏感方向，并使用可学习的多频率正弦编码进行调制，以捕捉跨尺度的平滑和振荡结构模式。

Result: MSH-GNN在广泛的图和节点分类任务中一致优于最先进的模型，特别是在涉及图拓扑和频谱频率联合变化的挑战性分类设置中表现出色。

Conclusion: MSH-GNN通过谐波投影和多频率调制，有效捕捉结构不对称性和高频调制，实现了更准确的图判别。

Abstract: Conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aggregate neighbor embeddings as
holistic vectors, lacking the ability to identify fine-grained,
direction-specific feature relevance. We propose MSH-GNN (Multi-Scale Harmonic
Graph Neural Network), a novel architecture that performs feature-wise adaptive
message passing through node-specific harmonic projections. For each node,
MSH-GNN dynamically projects neighbor features onto frequency-sensitive
directions determined by the target node's own representation. These
projections are further modulated using learnable sinusoidal encodings at
multiple frequencies, enabling the model to capture both smooth and oscillatory
structural patterns across scales. A frequency-aware attention pooling
mechanism is introduced to emphasize spectrally and structurally salient nodes
during readout. Theoretically, we prove that MSH-GNN approximates
shift-invariant kernels and matches the expressive power of the
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Empirically, MSH-GNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models on a wide range of graph and node classification tasks.
Furthermore, in challenging classification settings involving joint variations
in graph topology and spectral frequency, MSH-GNN excels at capturing
structural asymmetries and high-frequency modulations, enabling more accurate
graph discrimination.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种系统化评估边缘设备上大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，发现低比特量化在内存节省和性能权衡上的优势，并提供了实际部署指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在边缘设备上的部署增加，虽然带来了隐私优势，但模型容量减少和压缩技术导致性能受限。为此，需要一种系统化方法来评估这些模型的性能、开发效率和系统资源消耗。

Method: 论文引入了一种系统化方法，涵盖模型能力、开发效率和系统资源三个维度，评估了从0.5B到14B参数的模型，并测试了七种后训练量化（PTQ）方法。

Result: 研究发现：1) 系统级指标与有效比特权重（BPW）呈近线性关系；2) 约3.5 BPW是实用阈值，低比特量化的大模型优于高比特量化的小模型；3) 低BPW量化在精度损失较小的情况下显著节省内存；4) CPU上计算密集型操作比内存密集型操作更耗电。

Conclusion: 这些发现为资源受限的边缘设备上高效部署和优化LLMs提供了关键见解和实用指南。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices,
driven by model advancements and hardware improvements, offers significant
privacy benefits. However, these on-device LLMs inherently face performance
limitations due to reduced model capacity and necessary compression techniques.
To address this, we introduce a systematic methodology -- encompassing model
capability, development efficiency, and system resources -- for evaluating
on-device LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing models from 0.5B to
14B parameters and seven post-training quantization (PTQ) methods on commodity
laptops, yields several critical insights: 1) System-level metrics exhibit
near-linear scaling with effective bits-per-weight (BPW). 2) A practical
threshold exists around $\sim$3.5 effective BPW, larger models subjected to
low-bit quantization consistently outperform smaller models utilizing higher
bit-precision. 3) Quantization with low BPW incurs marginal accuracy loss but
significant memory savings. 4) Determined by low-level implementation specifics
power consumption on CPU, where computation-intensive operations spend more
power than memory-intensive ones. These findings offer crucial insights and
practical guidelines for the efficient deployment and optimized configuration
of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices. Our codebase is available at

Conclusion: Tango框架通过生成式验证器与生成器的协同进化，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an
LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,
current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are
fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking
and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently
train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central
innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is
trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is
trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without
requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained
verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to
deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual
reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both
components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:
the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level
math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the
verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit
particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical
reasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant advancements through the
application of various neural network architectures. In this study, we
systematically investigate the performance of several neural networks in RL

architecture-specific strengths and limitations. Our results reveal that: (1)
MLPs excel in fully observable continuous control tasks, providing an optimal
balance of performance and efficiency; (2) recurrent architectures like LSTM
and GRU offer robust performance in partially observable environments with
moderate memory requirements; (3) Mamba models achieve a 4.5x higher throughput
compared to LSTM and a 3.9x increase over GRU, all while maintaining comparable
performance; and (4) only Transformer-XL, Gated Transformer-XL, and Mamba-2
successfully solve the most challenging memory-intensive tasks, with Mamba-2
requiring 8x less memory than Transformer-XL. These findings provide insights
for researchers and practitioners, enabling more informed architecture

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统在科学发现中常因缺乏理性约束的预定义流程，导致假设无目标和证据脱节，阻碍系统性不确定性降低。

Method: 引入PiFlow框架，以科学原则为指导，将自动化科学发现视为结构化不确定性降低问题，并在三个科学领域进行评估。

Result: PiFlow在属性值与探索步骤的AUC上提升73.55%，解决方案质量提高94.06%，显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: PiFlow作为即插即用方法，为高效自动化科学发现建立新范式，推动更稳健、快速的AI驱动研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate
remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however,
often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack
rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a
failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering
systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally
requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an
information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a
structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific
laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering
nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with
targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency,
reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property
values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\%
compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a
Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient
automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated
AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，用于分析任意伪度量空间中深度神经网络的泛化界限，揭示了深度贡献与网络动态几何特性之间的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论在泛化界限的深度依赖性上取得了从指数到多项式甚至深度无关的进展，但这些结果仍局限于特定架构和欧几里得输入。本文旨在建立一个更通用的框架，适用于任意伪度量空间，并揭示深度网络动态特性对泛化性能的影响。

Method: 论文提出了一个统一框架，将深度-k网络视为连续隐藏映射和输出映射的组合。通过分析隐藏层生成的半群的词球增长，将深度贡献隔离在β(k)中，并利用Gromov定理将多项式增长与虚拟幂零动态、指数增长与扩展动态联系起来。

Result: 得到了形式为O(√((α + log β(k))/n))的泛化界限，其中β(k)捕捉了深度贡献。揭示了扩展动态通过组合表达能力带来指数级的参数节省。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了规范与实现的解耦，提供了与架构无关且动态系统感知的保证，适用于现代深度学习范式如测试时推理和扩散模型。

Abstract: Recent theory has reduced the depth dependence of generalization bounds from
exponential to polynomial and even depth-independent rates, yet these results
remain tied to specific architectures and Euclidean inputs. We present a
unified framework for arbitrary \blue{pseudo-metric} spaces in which a
depth-\(k\) network is the composition of continuous hidden maps
\(f:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\) and an output map \(h:\mathcal{X}\to
\mathbb{R}\). The resulting bound $O(\sqrt{(\alpha + \log \beta(k))/n})$
isolates the sole depth contribution in \(\beta(k)\), the word-ball growth of
the semigroup generated by the hidden layers. By Gromov's theorem polynomial
(resp. exponential) growth corresponds to virtually nilpotent (resp. expanding)
dynamics, revealing a geometric dichotomy behind existing $O(\sqrt{k})$
(sublinear depth) and $\tilde{O}(1)$ (depth-independent) rates. We further
provide covering-number estimates showing that expanding dynamics yield an
exponential parameter saving via compositional expressivity. Our results
decouple specification from implementation, offering architecture-agnostic and
dynamical-systems-aware guarantees applicable to modern deep-learning paradigms
such as test-time inference and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集和研究发现，MoTime为未来多模态时间序列预测研究提供了更全面的基准支持，证实了外部模态的潜在价值。

Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world
forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this
work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets
that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and
images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of
modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where
varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no
historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can
improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong
benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending
on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we
aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal
time series forecasting research.

Conclusion: 通过智能体协同规划统一特征工程流程，为特征增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: As a widely-used and practical tool, feature engineering transforms raw data
into discriminative features to advance AI model performance. However, existing
methods usually apply feature selection and generation separately, failing to
strive a balance between reducing redundancy and adding meaningful dimensions.
To fill this gap, we propose an agentic feature augmentation concept, where the
unification of feature generation and selection is modeled as agentic teaming
and planning. Specifically, we develop a Multi-Agent System with Long and
Short-Term Memory (MAGS), comprising a selector agent to eliminate redundant
features, a generator agent to produce informative new dimensions, and a router
agent that strategically coordinates their actions. We leverage in-context
learning with short-term memory for immediate feedback refinement and long-term
memory for globally optimal guidance. Additionally, we employ offline Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement fine-tuning to train the router agent
for effective decision-making to navigate a vast discrete feature space.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this unified agentic framework
consistently achieves superior task performance by intelligently orchestrating
feature selection and generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种通过随机切断反向传播流来减少Transformer注意力机制计算量的方法，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制在长序列处理时计算复杂度呈二次方增长，而大多数注意力权重很小，切断这些权重的反向传播可以显著减少计算量。

Method: 提出一种基于概率的规则，通过参数c控制每个token和注意力头最多保留c个交互，将注意力反向传播的计算复杂度从O(n²)降至O(nc)。

Result: 实验表明，在典型Transformer模型中，切断99%的注意力梯度流（c≈20-30）仅增加约1%的梯度方差，且方差随序列长度增加而减小。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效实现稀疏矩阵计算，显著降低长序列训练时的反向传播计算成本，使其远低于前向传播成本。

Abstract: It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that
stochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a
computational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the
computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation
computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient
variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention
mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention
becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically
with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very
small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small
fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising
targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule
controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most
attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention
head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the
attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear
complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical
transformer model, cutting $99\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing
$c \sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about
$1\%$ for $n \sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable
to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the
cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when
training a transformer model on long sequences.

trajectories can significantly impact clinical decision-making. Ensuring
transparency and explainability of the models responsible for these tasks is
essential for their adoption in critical settings. Recent work has explored a
top-down approach to bi-level transparency, focusing on understanding trends
and properties of predicted time series using static features. In this work, we
extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside
static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive
interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension
to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are
decomposed into meaningful trends and properties, enabling the extraction of
interpretable patterns. Through experiments on several synthetic datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach remains predictive while preserving
interpretability and robustness. This work represents a step towards developing
robust, and generalized time series forecasting models. The code is available

*Eray Can Elumar,Cem Tekin,Osman Yagan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CaMVo的高效标注框架，通过动态选择LLM子集和加权多数投票，在保证准确率的同时显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多数投票的LLM标注方法计算成本高，需要平衡标注准确性和成本效率。

Method: CaMVo利用LinUCB机制选择LLM子集，结合贝叶斯估计器计算置信度下界，采用加权多数投票聚合结果。

Result: 在MMLU和IMDB数据集上，CaMVo在保持或超越全量投票准确率的同时大幅降低标注成本。

Conclusion: CaMVo为动态标注环境提供了一种无需预训练/真实标签的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated
dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across
multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model
biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this
work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo),
for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively
selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings,
balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth
labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator
over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for
each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our
empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates
that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting
while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a
practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling
environments.

*Zihu Wang,Boxun Xu,Hejia Geng,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Khan-GCL的新框架，通过整合Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）到图对比学习（GCL）编码器架构中，提升了表示能力，并利用KAN系数参数生成语义上有意义的硬负样本，从而在各种数据集和任务上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图对比学习方法存在两个关键限制：基于多层感知机（MLP）的编码器表达能力有限，以及生成的负样本要么来自随机增强（无法提供有效的'硬负样本'），要么生成的硬负样本未能解决图数据区分所需的语义差异。

Method: 论文提出了Khan-GCL框架，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）整合到GCL编码器架构中，增强了其表示能力。此外，利用KAN系数参数中的丰富信息开发了两种新的关键特征识别技术，用于生成语义上有意义的硬负样本。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种数据集和任务上相比现有GCL方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Khan-GCL通过整合KAN和生成语义上有意义的硬负样本，显著提升了图对比学习的性能，为无标签数据学习通用图表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has demonstrated great promise for learning
generalizable graph representations from unlabeled data. However, conventional
GCL approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the restricted expressive
capacity of multilayer perceptron (MLP) based encoders, and (2) suboptimal
negative samples that either from random augmentations-failing to provide
effective 'hard negatives'-or generated hard negatives without addressing the
semantic distinctions crucial for discriminating graph data. To this end, we
propose Khan-GCL, a novel framework that integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN) into the GCL encoder architecture, substantially enhancing its
representational capacity. Furthermore, we exploit the rich information
embedded within KAN coefficient parameters to develop two novel critical
feature identification techniques that enable the generation of semantically
meaningful hard negative samples for each graph representation. These
strategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more
discriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between
graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety
of datasets and tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological
systems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models
have transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning
through large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these
capabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex
relational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To
this end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose
intelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric
tasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs,
unifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key
components: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation
mechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal,
task-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key
innovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology,
we examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent
capabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment,
heterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of
graph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational
infrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data. This survey
consolidates current progress and outlines future directions to guide research
in this rapidly evolving field. Resources are available at

TL;DR: AdvCLIP-LoRA提出了一种在少样本设置下增强CLIP模型对抗鲁棒性的方法，通过对抗微调实现，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）如CLIP在跨模态任务中表现出色，但对对抗攻击高度敏感。参数高效微调（PEFT）技术如LoRA在少样本场景下是高效的选择，但缺乏对抗鲁棒性。

Method: AdvCLIP-LoRA将对抗微调建模为一个极小极大优化问题，并在平滑性和非凸强凹性假设下提供理论收敛保证。

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验表明，AdvCLIP-LoRA显著提升了对抗常见攻击（如FGSM、PGD）的鲁棒性，同时保持了较高的干净准确率。

Conclusion: AdvCLIP-LoRA是一种实用且理论完备的方法，适用于资源受限环境下VLMs的鲁棒适应。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance
in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt
these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA have emerged as
scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios.
However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly
degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective
strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose
AdvCLIP-LoRA, the first algorithm designed to enhance the adversarial
robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method
formulates adversarial fine-tuning as a minimax optimization problem and
provides theoretical guarantees for convergence under smoothness and
nonconvex-strong-concavity assumptions. Empirical results across eight datasets
using ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 models show that AdvCLIP-LoRA significantly
improves robustness against common adversarial attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD),
without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA
as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for robust adaptation of
VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

*Shivam Agarwal,Zimin Zhang,Lifan Yuan,Jiawei Han,Hao Peng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过熵最小化（EM）方法，无需标注数据即可显著提升大语言模型在数学、物理和编程任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何仅通过熵最小化方法，无需任何标注数据，就能有效激发预训练大语言模型的潜在推理能力。

Method: 提出了三种熵最小化方法：EM-FT（基于无标注输出的指令微调）、EM-RL（以负熵为奖励的强化学习）和EM-INF（推理时调整logit以减少熵）。

Result: EM-RL在无标注数据情况下表现优于使用6万标注样本的基线方法；EM-INF使Qwen-32B在SciCode基准上媲美GPT-4o等专有模型，且效率提升3倍。

Conclusion: 熵最小化方法能有效激发预训练大语言模型的潜在推理能力，无需标注数据或参数更新即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more
probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple
objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large
language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding
tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy
similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the
model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only
reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce
entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL,
without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong
RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples.
Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of
proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the
challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than
self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many
pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that
can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any
labeled data or even any parameter updates.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-horizon average reward Constrained Markov
Decision Processes (CMDPs) with general parametrization. We propose a
Primal-Dual Natural Actor-Critic algorithm that adeptly manages constraints
while ensuring a high convergence rate. In particular, our algorithm achieves
global convergence and constraint violation rates of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ over a horizon of length $T$ when the mixing
time, $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, is known to the learner. In absence of knowledge
of $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}$, the achievable rates change to
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/T^{0.5-\epsilon})$ provided that $T \geq
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}^{2/\epsilon}\right)$. Our results
match the theoretical lower bound for Markov Decision Processes and establish a
new benchmark in the theoretical exploration of average reward CMDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为EC-LDA的新型标签分布攻击方法，通过压缩节点嵌入显著提升了攻击效果，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习（FGL）中，客户端需上传模型参数，这可能导致服务器推断客户端数据的隐私信息。本文旨在研究标签分布攻击（LDA），以揭示客户端本地数据的标签分布隐私。

Method: 首先观察到LDA效果与GNN中节点嵌入的方差密切相关，分析了二者关系后，提出了一种通过压缩节点嵌入提升攻击效果的新方法EC-LDA。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的图数据集上进行的节点分类和链接预测实验表明，EC-LDA在CoraFull和LastFM数据集上取得了最优的Cos-sim和JS-div评估指标值。

Conclusion: EC-LDA在标签分布攻击中表现出色，并在差分隐私保护下展现了较强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for graph analysis.
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging learning framework to
collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, since clients
are required to upload model parameters to the server in each round, this
provides the server with an opportunity to infer each client's data privacy. In
this paper, we focus on label distribution attacks(LDAs) that aim to infer the
label distributions of the clients' local data. We take the first step to
attack client's label distributions in FGL. Firstly, we observe that the
effectiveness of LDA is closely related to the variance of node embeddings in
GNNs. Next, we analyze the relation between them and we propose a new attack
named EC-LDA, which significantly improves the attack effectiveness by
compressing node embeddings. Thirdly, extensive experiments on node
classification and link prediction tasks across six widely used graph datasets
show that EC-LDA outperforms the SOTA LDAs. For example, EC-LDA attains optimal
values under both Cos-sim and JS-div evaluation metrics in the CoraFull and
LastFM datasets. Finally, we explore the robustness of EC-LDA under
differential privacy protection.

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法要么采用固定的超参数配置，要么需要离线或在线训练草稿模型以对齐上下文。这些方法无法根据生成文本的上下文动态调整超参数，限制了推理速度的进一步提升。

Method: 首先将超参数选择问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，提出通用框架BanditSpec。随后设计了两种基于老虎机的超参数选择算法UCBSpec和EXP3Spec，并分析了其停止时间遗憾。

Result: 理论分析表明UCBSpec的遗憾性能在通用常数内是最优的。实验证明在LLaMA3和Qwen2上，所提算法的吞吐量接近模拟真实场景中的最优超参数配置。

Conclusion: BanditSpec框架及其算法能够有效提升LLM的推理速度，且无需额外训练，适用于多样化的输入提示场景。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a popular method to accelerate the
inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) while retaining their superior text
generation performance. Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative
decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models
in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper
proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the
configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being
generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a
Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework
BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms,
UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity,
the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and
adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility
result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to
universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and
Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing
methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in
simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为学习历史过滤（LHF）的方法，通过重新加权和过滤学习历史来提升Transformer模型在上下文强化学习中的表现，有效解决了源算法/数据集带来的次优行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在上下文强化学习（ICRL）中表现出色，但通过模仿源RL算法的完整学习历史进行预训练时，可能会继承源算法/数据集的次优行为。因此，本文从数据集预处理的角度出发，旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出学习历史过滤（LHF）方法，基于学习历史的改进和稳定性特征，对学习历史进行重新加权和过滤。LHF可以与当前最先进的ICRL算法结合使用。

Result: 在多个ICRL基准测试中（包括离散环境和连续机器人操作任务），LHF表现出色，尤其在数据噪声较大的情况下，性能提升更为显著。

Conclusion: LHF是一种简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升ICRL的性能，特别是在处理次优或噪声数据时表现突出。

Abstract: Transformer models (TMs) have exhibited remarkable in-context reinforcement
learning (ICRL) capabilities, allowing them to generalize to and improve in
previously unseen environments without re-training or fine-tuning. This is
typically accomplished by imitating the complete learning histories of a source
RL algorithm over a substantial amount of pretraining environments, which,
however, may transfer suboptimal behaviors inherited from the source
algorithm/dataset. Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting
suboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the
success of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet
effective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by
reweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and
stability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first
approach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be
combined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We
substantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted
on the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and
continuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD,
DPT, DICP) as the backbones. LHF exhibits robust performance across a variety
of suboptimal scenarios, as well as under varying hyperparameters and sampling
strategies. Notably, the superior performance of LHF becomes more pronounced in
the presence of noisy data, indicating the significance of filtering learning
histories.

Result: Time Tracker在预测精度、模型泛化性和适应性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该模型通过创新架构有效解决了时间序列建模中的多样性和相关性挑战，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior
predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant
diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains,
making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex
scenarios. In addition, time series data may have multiple variables exhibiting
complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused
on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining
and finetuning stages, overlooking the valuable inter-series dependencies. To
this end, we propose \textbf{Time Tracker} for better predictions on
multivariate time series data. Firstly, we leverage sparse mixture of experts
(MoE) within Transformers to handle the modeling of diverse time series
patterns, thereby alleviating the learning difficulties of a single model while
improving its generalization. Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention,
enabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and
multivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling
during pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we
design a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from
frequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture
inter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling. Based on these
advancements, Time Tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting
accuracy, model generalization and adaptability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征转换方法存在组合空间爆炸、初始化敏感和易陷入局部最优等问题，限制了其实际应用效果。

Method: DIFFT将特征转换重构为奖励引导的生成任务，结合VAE学习紧凑的潜在空间，并用LDM生成高质量特征嵌入，最后通过半自回归解码器转换为离散特征。

Result: 在14个基准数据集上的实验表明，DIFFT在预测准确性和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，且训练和推理时间显著降低。

Conclusion: DIFFT通过全局分布学习和目标优化相结合，实现了高效且高性能的特征转换，为下游模型提供了更优质的特征表达。

Abstract: Feature Transformation (FT) crafts new features from original ones via
mathematical operations to enhance dataset expressiveness for downstream
models. However, existing FT methods exhibit critical limitations: discrete
search struggles with enormous combinatorial spaces, impeding practical use;
and continuous search, being highly sensitive to initialization and step sizes,
often becomes trapped in local optima, restricting global exploration. To
overcome these limitations, DIFFT redefines FT as a reward-guided generative
task. It first learns a compact and expressive latent space for feature sets
using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). A Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) then
navigates this space to generate high-quality feature embeddings, its
trajectory guided by a performance evaluator towards task-specific optima. This
synthesis of global distribution learning (from LDM) and targeted optimization
(reward guidance) produces potent embeddings, which a novel semi-autoregressive
decoder efficiently converts into structured, discrete features, preserving
intra-feature dependencies while allowing parallel inter-feature generation.
Extensive experiments on 14 benchmark datasets show DIFFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and robustness,
with significantly lower training and inference times.

Conclusion: 作为一种无需参数的后处理方法，SpecGap可以轻松集成到现有图神经网络模型中，无需额外训练或修改模型，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The task of graph-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for
deploying graph neural networks in real-world settings. In this paper, we
observe a significant difference in the relationship between the largest and
second-largest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix for in-distribution (ID) and
OOD graph samples: \textit{OOD samples often exhibit anomalous spectral gaps
(the difference between the largest and second-largest eigenvalues)}. This
observation motivates us to propose SpecGap, an effective post-hoc approach for
OOD detection on graphs. SpecGap adjusts features by subtracting the component
associated with the second-largest eigenvalue, scaled by the spectral gap, from
the high-level features (i.e., $\mathbf{X}-\left(\lambda_n-\lambda_{n-1}\right)
\mathbf{u}_{n-1} \mathbf{v}_{n-1}^T$). SpecGap achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets. We present extensive ablation
studies and comprehensive theoretical analyses to support our empirical
results. As a parameter-free post-hoc method, SpecGap can be easily integrated
into existing graph neural network models without requiring any additional
training or model modification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep models have highlighted the need for intelligent
systems that combine continual learning (CL) for knowledge acquisition with
machine unlearning (MU) for data removal, forming the Continual
Learning-Unlearning (CLU) paradigm. While existing work treats CL and MU as
separate processes, we reveal their intrinsic connection through a unified
optimization framework based on Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization. This
framework decomposes gradient updates for approximate CLU into four components:
learning new knowledge, unlearning targeted data, preserving existing
knowledge, and modulation via weight saliency. A critical challenge lies in
balancing knowledge update and retention during sequential learning-unlearning
cycles. To resolve this stability-plasticity dilemma, we introduce a
remain-preserved manifold constraint to induce a remaining Hessian compensation
for CLU iterations. A fast-slow weight adaptation mechanism is designed to
efficiently approximate the second-order optimization direction, combined with
adaptive weighting coefficients and a balanced weight saliency mask, proposing
a unified implementation framework for gradient-based CLU. Furthermore, we
pioneer task-agnostic CLU scenarios that support fine-grained unlearning at the
cross-task category and random sample levels beyond the traditional task-aware
setups. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed UG-CLU framework effectively
coordinates incremental learning, precise unlearning, and knowledge stability
across multiple datasets and model architectures, providing a theoretical
foundation and methodological support for dynamic, compliant intelligent
systems.

*Jiawei Gu,Ziyue Qiao,Xiao Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出NeuBM方法，通过中性输入校准减少图神经网络中的模型偏差，显著提升少数类别的平衡准确率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在不同领域表现优异，但在类别不平衡时易产生模型偏差，导致次优性能和不公平预测，尤其是对少数类别。

Method: NeuBM利用动态更新的中性图估计并校正模型固有偏差，通过从中性图获得的logits减去输入图的logits，重新校准预测。

Result: 实验表明，NeuBM显著提升少数类别的平衡准确率和召回率，尤其在类别严重不平衡和标记数据有限的情况下表现突出。

Conclusion: NeuBM不仅调整最终预测，还影响网络中平衡特征表示的学习，为表示平衡提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance across various
domains, yet they often struggle with model bias, particularly in the presence
of class imbalance. This bias can lead to suboptimal performance and unfair
predictions, especially for underrepresented classes. We introduce NeuBM
(Neutral Bias Mitigation), a novel approach to mitigate model bias in GNNs
through neutral input calibration. NeuBM leverages a dynamically updated
neutral graph to estimate and correct the inherent biases of the model. By
subtracting the logits obtained from the neutral graph from those of the input
graph, NeuBM effectively recalibrates the model's predictions, reducing bias
across different classes. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing GNN
architectures and training procedures, requiring minimal computational
overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
NeuBM significantly improves the balanced accuracy and recall of minority
classes, while maintaining strong overall performance. The effectiveness of
NeuBM is particularly pronounced in scenarios with severe class imbalance and
limited labeled data, where traditional methods often struggle. We provide
theoretical insights into how NeuBM achieves bias mitigation, relating it to
the concept of representation balancing. Our analysis reveals that NeuBM not
only adjusts the final predictions but also influences the learning of balanced
feature representations throughout the network.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然展示了特定启发式重训练方案的优势，但如何最优结合模型预测和原始标签仍是一个开放性问题。本文旨在解决这一基础性问题。

Method: 基于近似消息传递（AMP）框架，分析了高斯混合模型（GMM）和广义线性模型（GLM）两种真实场景下的迭代重训练过程，并推导出贝叶斯最优聚合函数。

Result: 理论分析表明，使用最优聚合函数进行重训练可以最小化预测误差，并在高标签噪声情况下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的理论框架和最优聚合函数为二元分类任务中的重训练策略提供了理论基础和实践指导，尤其在标签噪声较高时表现优异。

Abstract: Retraining a model using its own predictions together with the original,
potentially noisy labels is a well-known strategy for improving the model
performance. While prior works have demonstrated the benefits of specific
heuristic retraining schemes, the question of how to optimally combine the
model's predictions and the provided labels remains largely open. This paper
addresses this fundamental question for binary classification tasks. We develop
a principled framework based on approximate message passing (AMP) to analyze
iterative retraining procedures for two ground truth settings: Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) and generalized linear model (GLM). Our main contribution is the
derivation of the Bayes optimal aggregator function to combine the current
model's predictions and the given labels, which when used to retrain the same
model, minimizes its prediction error. We also quantify the performance of this
optimal retraining strategy over multiple rounds. We complement our theoretical
results by proposing a practically usable version of the theoretically-optimal
aggregator function for linear probing with the cross-entropy loss, and
demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods in the high label noise
regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出PKPO方法，通过优化pass@k性能来提升强化学习样本集的多样性和集体效用，解决了传统RL方法在探索和解决难题上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法独立奖励每个样本，忽视了样本集的多样性和集体效用，导致在解决难题时探索不足。

Method: 提出Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO)，通过转换最终奖励直接优化pass@k性能，并推导出低方差无偏估计器。

Result: PKPO有效优化了目标k值，高k值能解决更多难题，且退火k值同时提升了pass@1和pass@k性能。

Conclusion: PKPO通过优化样本集的集体效用，解锁了在传统pass@1优化停滞时的学习能力，提升了探索效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms sample multiple n>1 solution attempts
for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1
performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of
the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes
the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder
examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a
transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of
pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward
when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance
unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and
continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to
standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and
efficient transformation function.
  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable
robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of
trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k
during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1
numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.
  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the
variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world
examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation
effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable
solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and
pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1
optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to
better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual
samples.

*Haomin Bai,Dingzhi Yu,Shuai Li,Haipeng Luo,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种支持动态样本量的组分布鲁棒优化（GDRO）算法，通过两玩家博弈框架和新颖的预测有限建议（PLA）算法，实现了任意和变化样本量下的高效优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GDRO算法仅支持固定样本量（1或m），无法适应动态变化的样本量场景，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 将GDRO建模为两玩家博弈：一方解决在线凸优化问题，另一方处理预测有限建议（PLA）问题。提出新的PLA算法，构建样本量相关损失估计器，并采用正则化跟随策略更新决策。

Result: 首次建立了非遗忘PLA的高概率遗憾界，并开发了支持任意样本量的GDRO算法，优化误差界为O(1/t√(∑(m/r_j)log m))，样本复杂度与现有固定样本量结果一致。

Conclusion: 所提算法在合成和真实数据集上验证有效，为动态样本量场景提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that
perform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms
can only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and
therefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically.
To address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries
and cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex
optimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice
(PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm,
constructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is
either 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader.
Then, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious
PLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows
an arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability
optimization error bound of $O\left(\frac{1}{t}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^t
\frac{m}{r_j}\log m}\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$.
This result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of
samples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\log
(m)/\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\in[m]$, aligning with existing
bounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary
and real-world multi-class datasets.

Abstract: Efficient task scheduling is paramount in the Linux kernel, where the
Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) meticulously manages CPU resources to balance
high utilization with interactive responsiveness. This research pioneers the
use of deep learning techniques to predict the sequence of tasks selected by
CFS, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of a more generalized and potentially
more adaptive task scheduler for diverse workloads. Our core contributions are
twofold: first, the systematic generation and curation of a novel scheduling
dataset from a running Linux kernel, capturing real-world CFS behavior; and
second, the development, training, and evaluation of a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network designed to accurately forecast the next task to be scheduled.
This paper further discusses the practical pathways and implications of
integrating such a predictive model into the kernel's scheduling framework. The
findings and methodologies presented herein open avenues for data-driven
advancements in kernel scheduling, with the full source code provided for
reproducibility and further exploration.

Conclusion: CP-KAN通过创新的架构设计和优化方法，有效解决了度数选择和计算复杂度问题，为小样本学习提供了高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a
neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution
involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing
the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This
approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining
computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks
with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural
regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical
analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of
financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains
demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional
architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and
numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for
managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in
Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Koopman理论和深度神经网络的数值框架，用于高效表征高维动力系统中的分界面，并在合成基准、生态网络模型和神经科学任务训练的循环神经网络上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然系统（如决策相关的神经回路）可建模为具有多稳态的高维动力系统。现有工具主要描述稳定平衡点附近的行为，而表征分界面（划分不同吸引盆边界的流形）在高维情况下仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过结合Koopman理论和深度神经网络，近似与实正特征值相关的Koopman本征函数（KEFs），这些函数在分界面上精确消失，并利用标量KEFs通过优化方法定位分界面。

Result: 该方法在合成基准、生态网络模型和神经科学任务训练的循环神经网络中成功表征了分界面，并通过设计最优扰动实现了跨分界面的系统状态切换。

Conclusion: 所提框架为高维动力系统中分界面的表征提供了有效工具，并在神经科学的光遗传刺激实验预测中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Many natural systems, including neural circuits involved in decision making,
can be modeled as high-dimensional dynamical systems with multiple stable
states. While existing analytical tools primarily describe behavior near stable
equilibria, characterizing separatrices -- the manifolds that delineate
boundaries between different basins of attraction -- remains challenging,
particularly in high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce a numerical
framework leveraging Koopman Theory combined with Deep Neural Networks to
effectively characterize separatrices. Specifically, we approximate Koopman
Eigenfunctions (KEFs) associated with real positive eigenvalues, which vanish
precisely at the separatrices. Utilizing these scalar KEFs, optimization
methods efficiently locate separatrices even in complex systems. We demonstrate
our approach on synthetic benchmarks, ecological network models, and recurrent
neural networks trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks. Moreover, we illustrate
the practical utility of our method by designing optimal perturbations that can
shift systems across separatrices, enabling predictions relevant to optogenetic
stimulation experiments in neuroscience.

Conclusion: 研究为神经崩溃现象提供了更广泛的理论支持，并验证了其在现代深度架构中的普遍性。

Abstract: The empirical emergence of neural collapse -- a surprising symmetry in the
feature representations of the training data in the penultimate layer of deep
neural networks -- has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at its
understanding. However, existing work focuses on data-agnostic models or, when
data structure is taken into account, it remains limited to multi-layer
perceptrons. Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures
in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized
transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross
entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the
approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally
reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an
equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the
literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are
supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that,
as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习在5G核心网中因NWDAF客户端的资源限制和操作开销导致性能下降，需优化数据管理策略。

Method: 通过可靠性指标优化客户端间的垂直特征分割，并集中定义其本地模型。

Result: 实验证明该算法优于传统基线方法，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该算法有效解决了5G核心网中垂直联邦学习的可靠性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability
constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by
3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference
across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the
Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for
VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from
resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN
environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies,
characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This
presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full
advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we
propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while
centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm,
showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP)的新框架，通过扰动网络生成样本级别的logit扰动，以减少非因果属性（如图像背景）与类别之间的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在多个领域取得了广泛成功，但某些方法存在非鲁棒性问题，依赖于虚假相关性进行预测。解决这些限制至关重要，需要开发能够消除虚假相关性的方法。

Method: 研究通过logit扰动实现因果模型，引入CLP框架，利用扰动网络生成样本级别的logit扰动，并通过基于在线元学习的学习算法优化整个框架。

Result: 在四种典型的偏置学习场景（长尾学习、噪声标签学习、广义长尾学习和子群体偏移学习）中，CLP始终达到最先进的性能。可视化结果支持生成的因果扰动在重定向模型注意力到因果图像属性和消除虚假关联方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CLP框架通过生成因果logit扰动，有效减少了非因果属性与类别之间的虚假关联，并在多种偏置学习场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Deep learning has seen widespread success in various domains such as science,
industry, and society. However, it is acknowledged that certain approaches
suffer from non-robustness, relying on spurious correlations for predictions.
Addressing these limitations is of paramount importance, necessitating the
development of methods that can disentangle spurious correlations. {This study
attempts to implement causal models via logit perturbations and introduces a
novel Causal Logit Perturbation (CLP) framework to train classifiers with
generated causal logit perturbations for individual samples, thereby mitigating
the spurious associations between non-causal attributes (i.e., image
backgrounds) and classes.} {Our framework employs a} perturbation network to
generate sample-wise logit perturbations using a series of training
characteristics of samples as inputs. The whole framework is optimized by an
online meta-learning-based learning algorithm and leverages human causal
knowledge by augmenting metadata in both counterfactual and factual manners.
Empirical evaluations on four typical biased learning scenarios, including
long-tail learning, noisy label learning, generalized long-tail learning, and
subpopulation shift learning, demonstrate that CLP consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, visualization results support the
effectiveness of the generated causal perturbations in redirecting model
attention towards causal image attributes and dismantling spurious
associations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑标签类紧凑性和分离性的Margin-aware模糊粗糙特征选择框架(MAFRFS)，在降低不确定性的同时提升分类性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模糊粗糙特征选择(FRFS)方法主要关注降低模式分类中的不确定性，但低不确定性并不直接等同于更好的分类性能。需要弥合不确定性表征与模式分类之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出MAFRFS框架，同时考虑标签类的紧凑性和分离性，引导特征选择朝向更具区分度的类结构。

Result: 在15个公开数据集上的实验表明，MAFRFS具有高度可扩展性，且效果优于FRFS和其他6种先进特征选择算法。

Conclusion: MAFRFS通过联合优化不确定性和分类边界，实现了比传统FRFS更好的特征选择效果，为高维数据处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fuzzy rough feature selection (FRFS) is an effective means of addressing the
curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional data. By removing redundant and
irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance
generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most
existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern
classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result
in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a
key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To
bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a
Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers
both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively
reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature
selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures.
Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly
scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS
outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN)，通过主网络的训练损失直接引导辅助网络的探索，显著提升多样性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络(GFlowNets)在实践中常陷入模式坍塌，难以捕获奖励函数的多模态特性，需要更高效的探索方法。

Method: LGGFN利用主GFlowNet的训练损失作为信号，指导辅助网络优先采样高损失轨迹，集中探索模型理解不足的状态区域。

Result: 在网格环境、序列生成和贝叶斯结构学习等任务中，LGGFN比基线方法发现更多独特模式（如序列任务提升40倍），探索误差降低99%。

Conclusion: 损失引导的探索机制能有效解决GFlowNets的模式坍塌问题，显著加速高质量多样解的发现。

Abstract: Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture
multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in
practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged
training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on
heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel
approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the
main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main
model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions
of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the
discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various
benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and
Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency
and sample diversity compared to baselines. For instance, on a challenging
sequence generation task, it discovered over 40 times more unique valid modes
while simultaneously reducing the exploration error metric by approximately
99\%.

Conclusion: ReGUIDE通过数据高效的自推理和空间批评机制，为GUI元素定位提供了创新解决方案，性能优越且可扩展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces
(GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements
(e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this
remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale
web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose
Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a
novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn
data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism.
More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning
process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii)
criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under
input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance
through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with
coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly
advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming
baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2%
samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

Motivation: 扩散Transformer作为视觉生成模型的基础，其扩展性受到超参数调优高成本的限制。虽然μP方法在普通Transformer中已证明有效，但其是否适用于结构和目标不同的扩散Transformer尚不明确。

Result: 实验表明，采用μP的DiT-XL-2模型收敛速度提升2.9倍；将PixArt-α和MMDiT分别扩展到0.61B和18B参数时，μP模型性能均超越基线，且调优成本仅为原始方法的5.5%和3%。

Conclusion: μP为扩散Transformer的扩展提供了高效、低成本的框架，显著降低超参数调优开销，同时保持模型性能优势。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative
models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter
(HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P)
was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from
small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However,
it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion
Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we
generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its
effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that
$\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT,
PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer,
enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging
this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP
transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate
achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling
PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases,
models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small
tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of
consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a
principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于非线性特征子空间的OoD检测方法，通过KPCA学习判别性子空间，并利用重建误差区分InD和OoD数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高深度神经网络的可靠性，需要有效区分InD和OoD数据。论文从非线性特征子空间的角度出发，探索两者之间的差异。

Method: 使用KPCA框架学习判别性非线性子空间，设计Cosine-Gaussian核函数，并引入两种技术近似计算大规模InD数据的核矩阵。

Result: 提出的方法在OoD检测中表现出更高的效能和效率，尤其在核设计和计算优化方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 论文通过非线性特征子空间的新视角，为OoD检测提供了新的见解，并在实际应用中展示了高效和有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of deep
neural networks, the key of which lies in effectively characterizing the
disparities between OoD and In-Distribution (InD) data. In this work, such
disparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature
subspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD
features to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns
of OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their
different distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations
of InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD
detection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal
Component Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and
deploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD
data. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear
subspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the
computation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we
reveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD
disparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for
constructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to
approximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.
In particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD
data confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of
discriminative subspaces for OoD data. Our study presents new insights into the
non-linear feature subspace for OoD detection and contributes practical
explorations on the associated kernel design and efficient computations,
yielding a KPCA detection method with distinctively improved efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出LLM-Explorer，利用大语言模型动态生成任务特定的探索策略，增强强化学习中的策略探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习中的策略探索方法通常预设随机过程，不考虑任务特定特征，且在训练过程中调整不灵活。

Method: 通过采样智能体的学习轨迹，利用大语言模型分析当前策略学习状态并生成未来探索的概率分布，动态调整随机过程。

Result: 在Atari和MuJoCo基准测试中，LLM-Explorer平均性能提升高达37.27%。

Conclusion: LLM-Explorer是一个插件模块，兼容多种强化学习算法，能有效增强策略探索能力。

Abstract: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing
approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches
utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all
kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence
policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such
stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the
variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time
learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large
language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate
task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy
exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the
agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the
agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability
distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability
distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the
particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our
design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL
algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants
developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo
benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy
exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our
code is open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Explorer-19BE for

Conclusion: LSI是一种高效且广泛适用的样本信息度量方法，能够显著提升模型训练的效果和效率。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the informativeness of individual samples in a dataset
is an important objective in deep learning, as it can guide sample selection,
which can improve model efficiency and accuracy by removing redundant or
potentially harmful samples. We propose Laplace Sample Information (LSI)
measure of sample informativeness grounded in information theory widely
applicable across model architectures and learning settings. LSI leverages a
Bayesian approximation to the weight posterior and the KL divergence to measure
the change in the parameter distribution induced by a sample of interest from
the dataset. We experimentally show that LSI is effective in ordering the data
with respect to typicality, detecting mislabeled samples, measuring class-wise
informativeness, and assessing dataset difficulty. We demonstrate these
capabilities of LSI on image and text data in supervised and unsupervised
settings. Moreover, we show that LSI can be computed efficiently through probes
and transfers well to the training of large models.

Result: 在Atari基准测试中超越基线方法20.9%，兼容不同训练配置的代理。

Conclusion: LLM-Ens通过语义感知的动态集成显著提升RL性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for
training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective
agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful
tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random
seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance.
Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents
into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However,
existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are
designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific
tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we
propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with
task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).
Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into
distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task
conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each
individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the
inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and
switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring
dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is
designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds,
hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on
the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model
ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility,
our code is open-source at

Motivation: 当前大语言模型推理主要依赖策略方法，而基于价值的方法未被充分探索。作者希望重新审视经典贝尔曼残差最小化思想，探索其在LLM推理中的潜力。

Method: 提出轨迹贝尔曼残差最小化(TBRM)算法，直接优化轨迹级贝尔曼目标，利用模型自身logits作为Q值，无需critic、重要性采样或梯度裁剪。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，TBRM表现优于PPO、GRPO等策略方法，计算和内存开销相当或更低，证明了价值方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于价值的强化学习可能是提升LLM推理能力的原理性高效替代方案，为LLM训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines
for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches
largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual
Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an
algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet
effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman
objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for
critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one
rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized
policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved
change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard
mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms
policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower
computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL
might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning
capabilities in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer架构在多变量时间序列预测中难以有效建模变量间复杂的时序关系，因此需要一种更有效的方法来捕捉这些依赖关系。

Method: Sonnet架构结合了可学习的小波变换和Koopman算子进行谱分析，并引入了多变量相干注意力（MVCA）来建模变量间的依赖关系。

Result: 在47个预测任务中，Sonnet在34个任务上表现最佳，平均绝对误差（MAE）降低了1.1%。MVCA替换传统注意力机制后，在最具挑战性的任务中MAE平均降低了10.7%。

Conclusion: Sonnet通过谱分析和MVCA显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性，为解决复杂变量依赖关系提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Multivariable time series forecasting methods can integrate information from
exogenous variables, leading to significant prediction accuracy gains.
Transformer architecture has been widely applied in various time series
forecasting models due to its ability to capture long-range sequential
dependencies. However, a na\"ive application of transformers often struggles to
effectively model complex relationships among variables over time. To mitigate
against this, we propose a novel architecture, namely the Spectral Operator
Neural Network (Sonnet). Sonnet applies learnable wavelet transformations to
the input and incorporates spectral analysis using the Koopman operator. Its
predictive skill relies on the Multivariable Coherence Attention (MVCA), an
operation that leverages spectral coherence to model variable dependencies. Our
empirical analysis shows that Sonnet yields the best performance on $34$ out of
$47$ forecasting tasks with an average mean absolute error (MAE) reduction of
$1.1\%$ against the most competitive baseline (different per task). We further
show that MVCA -- when put in place of the na\"ive attention used in various
deep learning models -- can remedy its deficiencies, reducing MAE by $10.7\%$
on average in the most challenging forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Invertible neural architectures have recently attracted attention for their
compactness, interpretability, and information-preserving properties. In this
work, we propose the Fourier-Invertible Neural Encoder (FINE), which combines
invertible monotonic activation functions with reversible filter structures,
and could be extended using Invertible ResNets. This architecture is examined
in learning low-dimensional representations of one-dimensional nonlinear wave
interactions and exact circular translation symmetry. Dimensionality is
preserved across layers, except for a Fourier truncation step in the latent
space, which enables dimensionality reduction while maintaining shift
equivariance and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that FINE
significantly outperforms classical linear methods such as Discrete Fourier
Transformation (DFT) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and achieves
reconstruction accuracy better than conventional deep autoencoders with
convolutional layers (CNN) - while using substantially smaller models and
offering superior physical interpretability. These findings suggest that
invertible single-neuron networks, when combined with spectral truncation,
offer a promising framework for learning compact and interpretable
representations of physics datasets, and symmetry-aware representation learning
in physics-informed machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步数学推理中表现出色，但计算成本高昂，尤其是并行解码等方法在提升答案多样性的同时效率低下。本文旨在解决这一效率与准确性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出SSR框架，包含选择性并行模块（SPM）和步骤级推测解码（SSD）。SPM通过模型内部评分筛选有潜力的推理策略，SSD通过草稿-目标协作实现细粒度推理加速。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试（AIME 2024、MATH-500和LiveMathBench）上，SSR显著优于基线。例如，在LiveMathBench上，pass@1准确率提升13.84%，同时计算量降至基线的80.5%；在MATH-500上，计算量降至30%且无准确率损失。

Conclusion: SSR是一种无需训练的框架，通过步骤级推测解码有效加速数学推理，在保持准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on multi-step
mathematical reasoning, yet at the cost of high computational overhead. This
challenge is particularly acute for test-time scaling methods such as parallel
decoding, which increase answer diversity but scale poorly in efficiency. To
address this efficiency-accuracy trade-off, we propose SSR (Speculative
Parallel Scaling Reasoning), a training-free framework that leverages a key
insight: by introducing speculative decoding at the step level, we can
accelerate reasoning without sacrificing correctness. SSR integrates two
components: a Selective Parallel Module (SPM) that identifies a small set of
promising reasoning strategies via model-internal scoring, and Step-level
Speculative Decoding (SSD), which enables efficient draft-target collaboration
for fine-grained reasoning acceleration. Experiments on three mathematical
benchmarks-AIME 2024, MATH-500, and LiveMathBench - demonstrate that SSR
achieves strong gains over baselines. For instance, on LiveMathBench, SSR
improves pass@1 accuracy by 13.84% while reducing computation to 80.5% of the
baseline FLOPs. On MATH-500, SSR reduces compute to only 30% with no loss in
accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting models often produce systematic, predictable errors
even in critical domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare. We introduce
a novel post training adaptive optimization framework that improves forecast
accuracy without retraining or architectural changes. Our method automatically
applies expressive transformations optimized via reinforcement learning,
contextual bandits, or genetic algorithms to correct model outputs in a
lightweight and model agnostic way. Theoretically, we prove that affine
corrections always reduce the mean squared error; practically, we extend this
idea with dynamic action based optimization. The framework also supports an
optional human in the loop component: domain experts can guide corrections
using natural language, which is parsed into actions by a language model.
Across multiple benchmarks (e.g., electricity, weather, traffic), we observe
consistent accuracy gains with minimal computational overhead. Our interactive
demo shows the framework's real time usability. By combining automated post hoc
refinement with interpretable and extensible mechanisms, our approach offers a
powerful new direction for practical forecasting systems.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces critical challenges, particularly in
heterogeneous environments where non-independent and identically distributed
data across clients can lead to unfair and inefficient model performance. In
this work, we introduce \textit{DRDM}, a novel algorithm that addresses these
issues by combining a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework with
dynamic regularization to mitigate client drift. \textit{DRDM} frames the
training as a min-max optimization problem aimed at maximizing performance for
the worst-case client, thereby promoting robustness and fairness. This robust
objective is optimized through an algorithm leveraging dynamic regularization
and efficient local updates, which significantly reduces the required number of
communication rounds. Moreover, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis
for convex smooth objectives under partial participation. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, covering various model architectures and data
heterogeneity levels, demonstrate that \textit{DRDM} significantly improves
worst-case test accuracy while requiring fewer communication rounds than
existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth on the energy consumption of
participating clients, demonstrating that the number of local update steps can
be adaptively selected to achieve a target worst-case test accuracy with
minimal total energy cost across diverse communication environments.

Abstract: Integer quantization has emerged as a critical technique to facilitate
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Although they do reduce the
complexity of the learning models, their inference performance is often prone
to quantization-induced errors. To this end, we introduce InTreeger: an
end-to-end framework that takes a training dataset as input, and outputs an
architecture-agnostic integer-only C implementation of tree-based machine
learning model, without loss of precision. This framework enables anyone, even
those without prior experience in machine learning, to generate a highly
optimized integer-only classification model that can run on any hardware simply
by providing an input dataset and target variable. We evaluated our generated
implementations across three different architectures (ARM, x86, and RISC-V),
resulting in significant improvements in inference latency. In addition, we
show the energy efficiency compared to typical decision tree implementations
that rely on floating-point arithmetic. The results underscore the advantages
of integer-only inference, making it particularly suitable for energy- and
area-constrained devices such as embedded systems and edge computing platforms,
while also enabling the execution of decision trees on existing ultra-low power
devices.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven highly effective at modeling
relational data, pairwise connections cannot fully capture multi-way
relationships naturally present in complex real-world systems. In response to
this, Topological Deep Learning (TDL) leverages more general combinatorial
representations -- such as simplicial or cellular complexes -- to accommodate
higher-order interactions. Existing TDL methods often extend GNNs through
Higher-Order Message Passing (HOMP), but face critical \emph{scalability
challenges} due to \textit{(i)} a combinatorial explosion of message-passing
routes, and \textit{(ii)} significant complexity overhead from the propagation
mechanism. To overcome these limitations, we propose HOPSE (Higher-Order
Positional and Structural Encoder) -- a \emph{message passing-free} framework
that uses Hasse graph decompositions to derive efficient and expressive
encodings over \emph{arbitrary higher-order domains}. Notably, HOPSE scales
linearly with dataset size while preserving expressive power and permutation
equivariance. Experiments on molecular, expressivity and topological benchmarks
show that HOPSE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while
achieving up to 7 $times$ speedups over HOMP-based models, opening a new path
for scalable TDL.

Abstract: Low-rank regularization (LRR) has been widely applied in various machine
learning tasks, but the associated optimization is challenging. Directly
optimizing the rank function under constraints is NP-hard in general. To
overcome this difficulty, various relaxations of the rank function were
studied. However, optimization of these relaxed LRRs typically depends on
singular value decomposition, which is a time-consuming and nondifferentiable
operator that cannot be optimized with gradient-based techniques. To address
these challenges, in this paper we propose an efficient differentiable
approximation of the generalized LRR. The considered LRR form subsumes many
popular choices like the nuclear norm, the Schatten-$p$ norm, and various
nonconvex relaxations. Our method enables LRR terms to be appended to loss
functions in a plug-and-play fashion, and the GPU-friendly operations enable
efficient and convenient implementation. Furthermore, convergence analysis is
presented, which rigorously shows that both the bias and the variance of our
rank estimator rapidly reduce with increased sample size and iteration steps.
In the experimental study, the proposed method is applied to various tasks,
which demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 部分可观测环境下的强化学习面临不确定性带来的挑战，现有方法难以有效利用仿真环境中的额外信息。

Method: 提出Guided Policy Optimization (GPO)框架，通过模仿学习联合训练引导者（利用特权信息）和学习者（执行策略），确保两者策略一致。

Result: 理论证明GPO能达到与直接强化学习相当的优化效果，实验表明其在部分可观测控制任务和记忆挑战中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO通过特权信息引导的策略优化，克服了部分可观测强化学习的关键限制，为复杂环境下的学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in partially observable environments poses
significant challenges due to the complexity of learning under uncertainty.
While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can
enhance training, effectively leveraging it remains an open problem. To address
this, we introduce Guided Policy Optimization (GPO), a framework that co-trains
a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information
while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained
via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme
achieves optimality comparable to direct RL, thereby overcoming key limitations
inherent in existing approaches. Empirical evaluations show strong performance
of GPO across various tasks, including continuous control with partial
observability and noise, and memory-based challenges, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 在回归建模中，如何在捕捉非线性关系的同时保持模型的可解释性是一个持续的挑战。

Method: SplitWise通过浅层决策树将数值预测变量转换为基于阈值的二元特征，并使用AIC或BIC评估模型拟合改进。

Result: SplitWise在合成和真实数据集上评估，比传统逐步回归和惩罚回归技术产生更简洁和可推广的模型。

Conclusion: SplitWise在保持线性模型透明度的同时，有效捕捉非线性效应，提高了模型的简洁性和可推广性。

Abstract: Capturing nonlinear relationships without sacrificing interpretability
remains a persistent challenge in regression modeling. We introduce SplitWise,
a novel framework that enhances stepwise regression. It adaptively transforms
numeric predictors into threshold-based binary features using shallow decision
trees, but only when such transformations improve model fit, as assessed by the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
This approach preserves the transparency of linear models while flexibly
capturing nonlinear effects. Implemented as a user-friendly R package,
SplitWise is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
show that it consistently produces more parsimonious and generalizable models
than traditional stepwise and penalized regression techniques.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多项任务中表现出色，但其鲁棒性存在问题，特别是选项顺序敏感性（如偏好第一个选项或答案随选项顺序变化）。这种问题在LLM作为自动评估器时尤为突出。

Method: 引入Set-LLM，通过设计新的注意力掩码和位置编码，使预训练LLM能够处理无序的集合-文本输入，并保证排列不变性。

Conclusion: Set-LLM通过架构改进解决了LLM的顺序敏感性问题，为需要排列不变性的应用场景提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across
numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper
is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This
vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide
between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and
the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered.
The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of
multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators
in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce
Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the
processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The
adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings
specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance
and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively,
achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the
original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

Motivation: 现实场景中多任务学习的训练集通常大小不一（不平衡设置），而现有快速率边界仅适用于平衡设置。论文旨在填补这一空白，并探讨不平衡设置下的统计特性差异。

Method: 通过理论分析推导出数值可计算且可解释的不平衡多任务学习快速率泛化边界，并对比两种多任务风险定义（任务平等加权与样本加权）。

Result: 新边界在多种情况下提供比现有边界更强的保证，同时揭示了平衡与不平衡设置在统计性质上的本质差异。

Conclusion: 不平衡多任务学习需要独立的分析框架，其风险定义和统计特性与平衡设置存在根本不同，新边界为实际应用提供了更灵活的理论工具。

Abstract: We present new fast-rate generalization bounds for multi-task and
meta-learning in the unbalanced setting, i.e. when the tasks have training sets
of different sizes, as is typically the case in real-world scenarios.
Previously, only standard-rate bounds were known for this situation, while
fast-rate bounds were limited to the setting where all training sets are of
equal size. Our new bounds are numerically computable as well as interpretable,
and we demonstrate their flexibility in handling a number of cases where they
give stronger guarantees than previous bounds. Besides the bounds themselves,
we also make conceptual contributions: we demonstrate that the unbalanced
multi-task setting has different statistical properties than the balanced
situation, specifically that proofs from the balanced situation do not carry
over to the unbalanced setting. Additionally, we shed light on the fact that
the unbalanced situation allows two meaningful definitions of multi-task risk,
depending on whether if all tasks should be considered equally important or if
sample-rich tasks should receive more weight than sample-poor ones.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of
nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling
verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts,
the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to
the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified
first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural
approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as
surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on
the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of
our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing
that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the
flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not
previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an
autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators,
both yielding compelling results.

<details>

Motivation: 当前机器学习模型在处理多维数据时缺乏统一的代数框架，无法同时保持维度间的关联性和计算效率。本文旨在构建一个理论完备且兼容现代架构的多维组合运算体系。

Method: 设计轴特异性组合算子circ_i，保证各维度内部的结合律，并通过全局交换律实现跨维度一致性。框架可泛化SSM、Transformer等单维范式。

Result: 建立了具有维度局部结合性和全局交换性的代数体系，能恢复经典模型（如仿射变换、自注意力），并支持图像嵌入、结构化位置编码等新应用。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为多维数据处理提供了统一基础，未来可通过实证验证其在实际模型中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.

<details>

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速普及，AI模型处理的数据集规模急剧膨胀，而传统非结构化数据可视化方法（如t-SNE和UMAP）无法适应这种规模增长，这给依赖这些方法进行探索性数据分析的AI可解释性带来了重大挑战。

Result: 实验证明NOMAD Projection在性能和速度上优于现有技术，并通过绘制首个多语言维基百科完整数据图谱验证了其扩展性。

Conclusion: NOMAD Projection为超大规模非结构化数据可视化提供了高效解决方案，填补了AI可解释性工具链的关键空白。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI has driven an explosion in the size of
datasets consumed and produced by AI models. Traditional methods for
unstructured data visualization, such as t-SNE and UMAP, have not kept up with
the pace of dataset scaling. This presents a significant challenge for AI
explainability, which relies on methods such as t-SNE and UMAP for exploratory
data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Negative Or Mean Affinity
Discrimination (NOMAD) Projection, the first method for unstructured data
visualization via nonlinear dimensionality reduction that can run on multiple
GPUs at train time. We provide theory that situates NOMAD Projection as an
approximate upper bound on the InfoNC-t-SNE loss, and empirical results that
demonstrate NOMAD Projection's superior performance and speed profile compared
to existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the scalability of NOMAD
Projection by computing the first complete data map of Multilingual Wikipedia.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管可解释AI（XAI）取得了显著进展，但很少有方法能够解决嵌入向量空间中的可解释性问题，其中维度表示复杂的抽象概念。本文旨在填补这一空白，增强深度学习应用中嵌入空间的透明度和可信度。

Method: Distance Explainer方法基于RISE的显著性技术，通过选择性掩码和距离排序的掩码过滤来解释两个嵌入数据点之间的距离，并分配归因值。

Result: 在ImageNet和CLIP模型上的实验表明，该方法能够有效识别嵌入数据点之间相似性或差异性的特征，同时保持高鲁棒性和一致性。参数调优（如掩码数量和选择策略）对解释质量有显著影响。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Distance Explainer方法填补了XAI研究中的一个关键空白，提升了利用嵌入空间的深度学习应用的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: While eXplainable AI (XAI) has advanced significantly, few methods address
interpretability in embedded vector spaces where dimensions represent complex
abstractions. We introduce Distance Explainer, a novel method for generating
local, post-hoc explanations of embedded spaces in machine learning models. Our
approach adapts saliency-based techniques from RISE to explain the distance
between two embedded data points by assigning attribution values through
selective masking and distance-ranked mask filtering. We evaluate Distance
Explainer on cross-modal embeddings (image-image and image-caption pairs) using
established XAI metrics including Faithfulness, Sensitivity/Robustness, and
Randomization. Experiments with ImageNet and CLIP models demonstrate that our
method effectively identifies features contributing to similarity or
dissimilarity between embedded data points while maintaining high robustness
and consistency. We also explore how parameter tuning, particularly mask
quantity and selection strategy, affects explanation quality. This work
addresses a critical gap in XAI research and enhances transparency and
trustworthiness in deep learning applications utilizing embedded spaces.

Motivation: 现有基于HJB方程的强化学习方法通常假设系统动力学已知，这限制了其在实际中的应用。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Result: 通过定性和实证分析，展示了该方法相对于基于转移核的公式的潜在优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为连接随机最优控制和无模型强化学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: For continuous systems modeled by dynamical equations such as ODEs and SDEs,
Bellman's principle of optimality takes the form of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) equation, which provides the theoretical target of reinforcement learning
(RL). Although recent advances in RL successfully leverage this formulation,
the existing methods typically assume the underlying dynamics are known a
priori because they need explicit access to the coefficient functions of
dynamical equations to update the value function following the HJB equation. We
address this inherent limitation of HJB-based RL; we propose a model-free
approach still targeting the HJB equation and propose the corresponding
temporal difference method. We demonstrate its potential advantages over
transition kernel-based formulations, both qualitatively and empirically. The
proposed formulation paves the way toward bridging stochastic optimal control
and model-free reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 图机器学习社区在消息传递范式的快速发展中，对过度平滑、过度挤压、同配性-异配性二分法及长程任务等问题形成了普遍但未必准确的假设，导致研究问题的模糊和误解。

Conclusion: 论文旨在澄清问题，促进更精确的研究方向，以减少误解并推动图机器学习领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: After a renaissance phase in which researchers revisited the message-passing
paradigm through the lens of deep learning, the graph machine learning
community shifted its attention towards a deeper and practical understanding of
message-passing's benefits and limitations. In this position paper, we notice
how the fast pace of progress around the topics of oversmoothing and
oversquashing, the homophily-heterophily dichotomy, and long-range tasks, came
with the consolidation of commonly accepted beliefs and assumptions that are
not always true nor easy to distinguish from each other. We argue that this has
led to ambiguities around the investigated problems, preventing researchers
from focusing on and addressing precise research questions while causing a good
amount of misunderstandings. Our contribution wants to make such common beliefs
explicit and encourage critical thinking around these topics, supported by
simple but noteworthy counterexamples. The hope is to clarify the distinction
between the different issues and promote separate but intertwined research
directions to address them.

TL;DR: 论文提出LS-attention机制，通过分解自注意力为局部和全局头，解决Transformer训练不稳定的问题，显著提升效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制在捕捉短程依赖上存在局限，导致训练不稳定（如损失值突增）。尤其在语言建模等任务中，邻近token的强依赖性加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出Long Short-attention（LS-attention），将自注意力分解为局部（短程）和全局（长程）注意力头，抑制logit爆炸。

Result: LS-attention将验证困惑度降至基线方法的2/5，GPU耗时仅为对比方法的1/20，推理延迟降低36%，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: LS-attention通过分离注意力范围有效提升训练稳定性与模型性能，为Transformer优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer language models have driven significant progress across various
fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. A central
component of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns
rich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with
others in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers
continue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or
divergence in the training loss during a run.
  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited
ability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language
modeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This
limitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing
training. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local
(short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed
attention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit
explosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent
multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative
training stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation
perplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar
perplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally,
our experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up
to 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.

Abstract: Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping
grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage
decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool
for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault
line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability
depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor
failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a
challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically
validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the
impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate
realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative
insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by
applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model
remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after
a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance
decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to
communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer
actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.
This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络概念发现方法多关注单个神经元或人类可解释特征，而忽略了分布式的层级别模式。本文旨在通过NAP方法填补这一空白，以更好地理解和解释神经网络行为。

Method: 采用神经网络激活模式（NAP）方法，通过聚类全层激活分布来识别层级别概念。改进包括归一化、分布估计、距离度量和多样化的聚类选择。

Result: 在视觉对象识别模型中，NAP方法成功识别了层级别概念；在无线电接收机模型中，未发现离散概念，而是观察到由信噪比（SNR）形成的连续激活流形，表明SNR是模型学习的关键因素。改进后的NAP方法提高了分布内与分布外的分离效果。

Conclusion: 聚类设计和激活流形在解释和调试神经网络行为中至关重要。改进后的NAP方法不仅提升了泛化能力，还间接验证了聚类质量，为神经网络的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Concept discovery in neural networks often targets individual neurons or
human-interpretable features, overlooking distributed layer-wide patterns. We
study the Neural Activation Pattern (NAP) methodology, which clusters
full-layer activation distributions to identify such layer-level concepts.
Applied to visual object recognition and radio receiver models, we propose
improved normalization, distribution estimation, distance metrics, and varied
cluster selection. In the radio receiver model, distinct concepts did not
emerge; instead, a continuous activation manifold shaped by Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) was observed -- highlighting SNR as a key learned factor,
consistent with classical receiver behavior and supporting physical
plausibility. Our enhancements to NAP improved in-distribution vs.
out-of-distribution separation, suggesting better generalization and indirectly
validating clustering quality. These results underscore the importance of
clustering design and activation manifolds in interpreting and troubleshooting
neural network behavior.

Abstract: The data-to-equation (Data2Eqn) task aims to discover interpretable
mathematical equations that map observed values to labels, offering physical
insights and broad applicability across academic and industrial domains.
Genetic programming and traditional deep learning-based approaches suffer from
search inefficiency and poor generalization on small task-specific datasets.
Foundation models showed promise in this area, but existing approaches suffer
from: 1) They are pretrained on general-purpose data distributions, making them
less effective for domain-specific tasks; and 2) their training objectives
focus on token-level alignment, overlooking mathematical semantics, which can
lead to inaccurate equations. To address these issues, we aim to enhance the
domain adaptability of foundation models for Data2Eqn tasks. In this work, we
propose a reinforcement learning-based finetuning framework that directly
optimizes the generation policy of a pretrained model through reward signals
derived from downstream numerical fitness. Our method allows the model to adapt
to specific and complex data distributions and generate mathematically
meaningful equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
improves both the accuracy and robustness of equation generation under complex
distributions.

Result: 实验表明，FLowDUP在多种统计异构客户端的数据集上表现优异，并通过消融研究验证了方法的各个组件的有效性。

Conclusion: FLowDUP为无标签数据的个性化联邦学习提供了理论支持和实践解决方案，扩展了联邦学习的应用范围。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning has emerged as a popular approach to training
on devices holding statistically heterogeneous data, known as clients. However,
most existing approaches require a client to have labeled data for training or
finetuning in order to obtain their own personalized model. In this paper we
address this by proposing FLowDUP, a novel method that is able to generate a
personalized model using only a forward pass with unlabeled data. The generated
model parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient
communication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically
motivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound,
that provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients. The objective is
structured in such a way that it allows both clients with labeled data and
clients with only unlabeled data to contribute to the training process. To
supplement our theoretical results we carry out a thorough experimental
evaluation of FLowDUP, demonstrating strong empirical performance on a range of
datasets with differing sorts of statistically heterogeneous clients. Through
numerous ablation studies, we test the efficacy of the individual components of
the method.

*Carlos Stein Brito,Daniel McNamee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Reflexive World Models (RWM)的双重控制框架，用于在动态变化的环境中快速适应并保持控制策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界中部署学习到的控制策略时，系统动态的意外变化会导致性能下降，直到模型在新数据上重新训练。这促使研究者寻找一种能够快速适应动态变化的方法。

Method: RWM框架将控制问题分为两部分：通过强化学习实现长期奖励最大化，以及通过快速潜在控制实现鲁棒的运动执行。该方法利用世界模型预测作为隐式参考轨迹，实现快速适应。

Result: 与基于模型的强化学习基线相比，RWM在保持接近最优性能的同时，实现了显著更快的适应速度，且在线计算成本较低。

Conclusion: RWM结合了强化学习的灵活策略学习和快速错误纠正能力，为在高维连续控制任务中保持性能提供了一种原则性方法。

Abstract: Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a
fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance
degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World
Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as
implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the
control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement
learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual
architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online
computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining
near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy
learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction
capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in
high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基础模型虽表现优异，但仍易受对抗性输入攻击。扩散去噪平滑技术虽能提升鲁棒性，但在分类以外的任务中效果未明。研究发现高噪声扩散会显著降低性能，而低噪声则无法抵御所有攻击。新攻击策略可针对扩散过程本身绕过防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在多种任务中表现卓越，但对对抗性输入的脆弱性仍是问题。扩散去噪平滑技术作为提升模型鲁棒性的方法，其在分类以外的任务中的有效性尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究分析了三个数据集上的四种下游任务，并应用了三种不同的对抗攻击算法。同时，引入了一种针对扩散过程本身的新型攻击策略。

Result: 研究发现，高噪声扩散去噪会显著降低模型性能（高达57%），而低噪声设置虽能保持性能，但无法抵御所有攻击类型。新型攻击策略能在低噪声条件下绕过防御。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，对抗鲁棒性与性能之间的权衡仍是一个待解决的挑战。扩散去噪平滑技术在实际应用中需谨慎调整噪声水平以平衡性能与防御效果。

Abstract: While foundation models demonstrate impressive performance across various
tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Current research explores
various approaches to enhance model robustness, with Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing emerging as a particularly promising technique. This method employs a
pretrained diffusion model to preprocess inputs before model inference. Yet,
its effectiveness remains largely unexplored beyond classification. We aim to
address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream
tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal
that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional
transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images
without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%.
Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate
protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack
strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of
circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime. Our results suggest that the
trade-off between adversarial robustness and performance remains a challenge to
be addressed.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve
finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We
iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and
the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time
version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training
objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the
networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on
different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach,
demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic
control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网的兴起，边缘机器学习需求增加，但资源受限设备（如MCU）的性能评估仍面临挑战，现有解决方案存在明显局限性。

Method: 提出了一种基准测试方法，集成能耗和延迟测量，区分三个执行阶段，并确保设备不受外部测量单元供电，同时利用自动化测试增强统计显著性。

Result: 测试STM32N6 MCU的两种配置（高性能和低功耗）表明，降低核心电压和时钟频率可提高前后处理效率，而不显著影响网络执行性能。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于跨平台比较，以确定最高效的推理平台，并量化不同硬件实现中前后处理开销的变化。

Abstract: The rise of IoT has increased the need for on-edge machine learning, with
TinyML emerging as a promising solution for resource-constrained devices such
as MCU. However, evaluating their performance remains challenging due to
diverse architectures and application scenarios. Current solutions have many
non-negligible limitations. This work introduces an alternative benchmarking
methodology that integrates energy and latency measurements while
distinguishing three execution phases pre-inference, inference, and
post-inference. Additionally, the setup ensures that the device operates
without being powered by an external measurement unit, while automated testing
can be leveraged to enhance statistical significance. To evaluate our setup, we
tested the STM32N6 MCU, which includes a NPU for executing neural networks. Two
configurations were considered: high-performance and Low-power. The variation
of the EDP was analyzed separately for each phase, providing insights into the
impact of hardware configurations on energy efficiency. Each model was tested
1000 times to ensure statistically relevant results. Our findings demonstrate
that reducing the core voltage and clock frequency improve the efficiency of
pre- and post-processing without significantly affecting network execution
performance. This approach can also be used for cross-platform comparisons to
determine the most efficient inference platform and to quantify how pre- and
post-processing overhead varies across different hardware implementations.

TL;DR: 论文发现嵌入层是神经网络延迟泛化（grokking）的关键因素，并提出两种机制解释该现象，同时设计了优化方法加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索神经网络中延迟泛化现象（grokking）的驱动因素，特别是在Transformer和MLP中观察到的训练后性能突增现象。

Method: 通过分析嵌入层的更新动态和双线性耦合机制，提出频率感知采样和嵌入层特定学习率的方法来优化训练过程。

Result: 实验证明嵌入层是延迟泛化的核心，优化方法能有效加速收敛，并适用于更广泛的Transformer优化问题。

Conclusion: 嵌入层在延迟泛化中起关键作用，提出的优化策略不仅改善grokking动态，还能解决双线性耦合导致的训练效率问题。

Abstract: Grokking, a delayed generalization in neural networks after perfect training
performance, has been observed in Transformers and MLPs, but the components
driving it remain underexplored. We show that embeddings are central to
grokking: introducing them into MLPs induces delayed generalization in modular
arithmetic tasks, whereas MLPs without embeddings can generalize immediately.
Our analysis identifies two key mechanisms: (1) Embedding update dynamics,
where rare tokens stagnate due to sparse gradient updates and weight decay, and
(2) Bilinear coupling, where the interaction between embeddings and downstream
weights introduces saddle points and increases sensitivity to initialization.
To confirm these mechanisms, we investigate frequency-aware sampling, which
balances token updates by minimizing gradient variance, and embedding-specific
learning rates, derived from the asymmetric curvature of the bilinear loss
landscape. We prove that an adaptive learning rate ratio,
\(\frac{\eta_E}{\eta_W} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\max}(E)}{\sigma_{\max}(W)} \cdot
\frac{f_W}{f_E}\), mitigates bilinear coupling effects, accelerating
convergence. Our methods not only improve grokking dynamics but also extend to
broader challenges in Transformer optimization, where bilinear interactions
hinder efficient training.

Abstract: Machine learning explainability aims to make the decision-making process of
black-box models more transparent by finding the most important input features
for a given prediction task. Recent works have proposed composing explanations
from semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently
interpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore
the communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand
the prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical
doctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient
may need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In
this paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations. We propose
an iterative procedure grounded in principles of pragmatic reasoning and the
rational speech act to generate explanations that maximize communicative
utility. Our procedure only needs access to pairwise preferences between
candidate explanations, relevant in real-world scenarios where a listener model
may not be available. We evaluate our method in image classification tasks,
demonstrating improved alignment between explanations and listener preferences
across three datasets. Furthermore, we perform a user study that demonstrates
our explanations increase communicative utility.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)虽能优化模型架构，但搜索过程能耗巨大。现有基于代理的基准测试方法虽能减少全训练成本，但能耗评估存在不准确性，需设计更可靠的能耗感知基准。

Conclusion: 能耗感知基准测试需关注测量工具选择与校准，论文提出的设计原则和校准方法可帮助开发更准确的基准测试工具，实现模型能耗与精度的更好权衡。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning
through systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is
increasingly large energy consumption during the search process.
Surrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a
pre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model.
Specifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to
favourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this
end, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i)
reliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic
cost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that
the choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results.
Using the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying
library influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection,
returning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with
accurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study,
we bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware
surrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design
novel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our
device, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down
even further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we
propose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as
Code Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to
8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the
device.

Conclusion: OBS为贝叶斯集成学习提供了一种高效且理论支持的方法，适用于在线持续学习环境，并在特定场景下表现更优。

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of Bayesian ensembles and address the
challenge of learning optimal combinations of Bayesian models in an online,
continual learning setting. To this end, we reinterpret existing approaches
such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and Bayesian stacking through a novel
empirical Bayes lens, shedding new light on the limitations and pathologies of
BMA. Further motivated by insights from online optimization, we propose Online
Bayesian Stacking (OBS), a method that optimizes the log-score over predictive
distributions to adaptively combine Bayesian models. A key contribution of our
work is establishing a novel connection between OBS and portfolio selection,
bridging Bayesian ensemble learning with a rich, well-studied theoretical
framework that offers efficient algorithms and extensive regret analysis. We
further clarify the relationship between OBS and online BMA, showing that they
optimize related but distinct cost functions. Through theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluation, we identify scenarios where OBS outperforms online BMA
and provide principled guidance on when practitioners should prefer one
approach over the other.

Result: 新停止规则严格匹配理论下界，实现了多最优臂场景的实例最优性。

Conclusion: 改进后的算法填补了多最优臂场景的理论空白，完善了固定置信度下的最优臂识别框架。

Abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification in stochastic multi-armed
bandits under the fixed-confidence setting, with a particular focus on
instances that admit multiple optimal arms. While the Track-and-Stop algorithm
of Garivier and Kaufmann (2016) is widely conjectured to be instance-optimal,
its performance in the presence of multiple optima has remained insufficiently
understood. In this work, we revisit the Track-and-Stop strategy and propose a
modified stopping rule that ensures instance-optimality even when the set of
optimal arms is not a singleton. Our analysis introduces a new
information-theoretic lower bound that explicitly accounts for multiple optimal
arms, and we demonstrate that our stopping rule tightly matches this bound.

Conclusion: 该框架避免了私有选择程序的负面影响，在分布式高维模型中具有显著实用优势。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding second-order stationary points (SOSP)
in differentially private (DP) stochastic non-convex optimization. Existing
methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) inaccurate convergence error rate
due to overlooking gradient variance in the saddle point escape analysis, and
(ii) dependence on auxiliary private model selection procedures for identifying
DP-SOSP, which can significantly impair utility, particularly in distributed
settings. To address these issues, we propose a generic perturbed stochastic
gradient descent (PSGD) framework built upon Gaussian noise injection and
general gradient oracles. A core innovation of our framework is using model
drift distance to determine whether PSGD escapes saddle points, ensuring
convergence to approximate local minima without relying on second-order
information or additional DP-SOSP identification. By leveraging the adaptive
DP-SPIDER estimator as a specific gradient oracle, we develop a new DP
algorithm that rectifies the convergence error rates reported in prior work. We
further extend this algorithm to distributed learning with arbitrarily
heterogeneous data, providing the first formal guarantees for finding DP-SOSP
in such settings. Our analysis also highlights the detrimental impacts of
private selection procedures in distributed learning under high-dimensional
models, underscoring the practical benefits of our design. Numerical
experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our approach.

Motivation: 决策树是机器学习中用于数据表示和分类的基本工具。构建小型决策树（通过最小化大小或深度）是提高模型效率和可解释性的关键。然而，决策树学习的参数化复杂度尚未充分研究，特别是在允许一定错误率的情况下。

Method: 论文考虑了决策树学习的泛化问题，即在给定分类实例和允许的错误数下，构建最小化大小或深度的决策树。通过参数化复杂度理论，分析了这些问题在不同参数组合下的计算复杂性。

Result: 研究发现，当参数化为最大特征差异时，最小化决策树大小或深度的问题是W[1]-难的。然而，当包括允许的错误数作为参数时，这些问题变为固定参数可解（FPT）。此外，论文还给出了关于核化复杂性的正负结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为决策树学习的参数化复杂度提供了新的理论结果，表明在特定参数组合下，问题可能变得可解，这为实际应用中的算法设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Decision trees are a fundamental tool in machine learning for representing,
classifying, and generalizing data. It is desirable to construct ``small''
decision trees, by minimizing either the \textit{size} ($s$) or the
\textit{depth} $(d)$ of the \textit{decision tree} (\textsc{DT}). Recently, the
parameterized complexity of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning} has attracted a lot
of attention. We consider a generalization of \textsc{Decision Tree Learning}
where given a \textit{classification instance} $E$ and an integer $t$, the task
is to find a ``small'' \textsc{DT} that disagrees with $E$ in at most $t$
examples. We consider two problems: \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}, where the
goal is to construct a \textsc{DT} minimizing $s$ and $d$, respectively. We
first establish that both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO} are W[1]-hard when
parameterized by $s+\delta_{max}$ and $d+\delta_{max}$, respectively, where
$\delta_{max}$ is the maximum number of features in which two differently
labeled examples can differ. We complement this result by showing that these
problems become \textsc{FPT} if we include the parameter $t$. We also consider
the kernelization complexity of these problems and establish several positive
and negative results for both \textsc{DTSO} and \textsc{DTDO}.

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率学习曲线数据库LCDB 1.1，并采用统计严谨的方法分析学习曲线的行为特性。

Conclusion: 学习曲线的不良行为比预期更普遍，对下游任务构成挑战，LCDB 1.1为未来研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Sample-wise learning curves plot performance versus training set size. They
are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and
model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone
(i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves
Database 1.1 (LCDB 1.1), a large-scale database with high-resolution learning
curves, we show that learning curves are less often well-behaved than
previously thought. Using statistically rigorous methods, we observe
significant ill-behavior in approximately 14% of the learning curves, almost
twice as much as in previous estimates. We also identify which learners are to
blame and show that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others.
Additionally, we demonstrate that different feature scalings rarely resolve
ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such
as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant
challenges, underscoring the relevance and potential of LCDB 1.1 as a
challenging benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable
at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling
iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as
algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the
non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into
neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular
representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants
of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft"
permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort.
We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and
Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible
with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a
controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and
IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT,
respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable
parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and
demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.

Abstract: Data synthesis is gaining momentum as a privacy-enhancing technology. While
single-table tabular data generation has seen considerable progress, current
methods for multi-table data often lack the flexibility and expressiveness
needed to capture complex relational structures. In particular, they struggle
with long-range dependencies and complex foreign-key relationships, such as
tables with multiple parent tables or multiple types of links between the same
pair of tables. We propose a generative model for relational data that
generates the content of a relational dataset given the graph formed by the
foreign-key relationships. We do this by learning a deep generative model of
the content of the whole relational database by flow matching, where the neural
network trained to denoise records leverages a graph neural network to obtain
information from connected records. Our method is flexible, as it can support
relational datasets with complex structures, and expressive, as the generation
of each record can be influenced by any other record within the same connected
component. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and show that
it achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of synthetic data fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作在高元PAC学习理论中提出了VCNk维度的概念，并几乎完全刻画了高元PAC学习的各种情形，但非分割、非不可知情形仍为开放问题。本工作旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过直接证明经典PAC学习隐含经典Haussler打包性质，进而推出Natarajan维度的有限性，并将这些证明推广到高元情形。

Result: 证明了非分割、非不可知高元PAC学习隐含高元版本的Haussler打包性质，从而推出VCNk维度的有限性。

Conclusion: 该工作完成了高元PAC学习理论的特征刻画，为学习图、超图和关系结构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Recently, the authors introduced the theory of high-arity PAC learning, which
is well-suited for learning graphs, hypergraphs and relational structures. In
the same initial work, the authors proved a high-arity analogue of the
Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning that almost completely
characterizes all notions of high-arity PAC learning in terms of a
combinatorial dimension, called the Vapnik--Chervonenkis--Natarajan (VCN${}_k$)
$k$-dimension, leaving as an open problem only the characterization of
non-partite, non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability.
  In this work, we complete this characterization by proving that non-partite
non-agnostic high-arity PAC learnability implies a high-arity version of the
Haussler packing property, which in turn implies finiteness of
VCN${}_k$-dimension. This is done by obtaining direct proofs that classic PAC
learnability implies classic Haussler packing property, which in turn implies
finite Natarajan dimension and noticing that these direct proofs nicely lift to
high-arity.

TL;DR: 论文研究了噪声标签在离线对齐中的影响，重点关注隐私与对抗性腐败之间的相互作用，提出了LTC和CTL两种场景下的理论分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解噪声标签（如隐私保护和对抗性腐败）如何影响离线对齐的效果，特别是在强化学习人类反馈（RLHF）和直接偏好优化（DPO）中的应用。

Method: 方法上，论文采用线性建模假设，将离线对齐问题转化为逻辑回归中的参数估计问题，并分析了LTC和CTL两种隐私-腐败交互场景。

Result: 结果表明，LTC场景比CTL更具挑战性，即使在线性模型下也是如此。同时，研究还推动了隐私或腐败单一场景下的理论进展。

Conclusion: 结论指出，隐私保护和对抗性腐败的交互对离线对齐有显著影响，LTC场景尤为复杂，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically investigate the effects of noisy labels in
offline alignment, with a focus on the interplay between privacy and robustness
against adversarial corruption. Specifically, under linear modeling
assumptions, we present a unified analysis covering both reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under
different privacy-corruption scenarios, such as Local differential
privacy-then-Corruption (LTC), where human preference labels are privatized
before being corrupted by an adversary, and Corruption-then-Local differential
privacy (CTL), where labels are corrupted before privacy protection. Our
analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment
problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic
regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation
result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge
than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models. As important
by-products, our findings also advance the state-of-the-art theoretical results
in offline alignment under privacy-only or corruption-only scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种在本地差分隐私下的共形预测方法，适用于标签敏感场景，无需访问真实标签即可保证预测覆盖概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对隐私敏感场景中聚合器不可信且只能访问扰动标签的问题，研究如何在保护隐私的同时维持共形预测的覆盖保证。

Method: 1) 基于k-ary随机响应的特征和扰动标签提交；2) 基于二分搜索响应对模型分数加噪。两种方法均直接从噪声数据计算共形阈值。

Result: 理论证明有限样本覆盖保证，实验显示即使在高强度随机化下仍能保持稳健覆盖。

Conclusion: 该方法将强本地隐私与预测不确定性控制结合，适用于医疗影像或大模型查询等敏感场景，且不依赖用户自主计算分数。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides sets of candidate classes with a
guaranteed probability of containing the true class. However, it typically
relies on a calibration set with clean labels. We address privacy-sensitive
scenarios where the aggregator is untrusted and can only access a perturbed
version of the true labels. We propose two complementary approaches under local
differential privacy (LDP). In the first approach, users do not access the
model but instead provide their input features and a perturbed label using a
k-ary randomized response. In the second approach, which enforces stricter
privacy constraints, users add noise to their conformity score by binary search
response. This method requires access to the classification model but preserves
both data and label privacy. Both approaches compute the conformal threshold
directly from noisy data without accessing the true labels. We prove
finite-sample coverage guarantees and demonstrate robust coverage even under
severe randomization. This approach unifies strong local privacy with
predictive uncertainty control, making it well-suited for sensitive
applications such as medical imaging or large language model queries,
regardless of whether users can (or are willing to) compute their own scores.

TL;DR: 提出高阶结构时序图神经网络HTGN，通过超图表示提升动态链接预测性能，同时降低50%内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序图神经网络仅关注二元交互，忽略高阶结构且存在效率瓶颈，难以捕捉真实时序图中的群体交互动态。

Method: 融合超图表示，开发高阶结构识别算法，通过超边特征聚合降低训练内存消耗。

Result: 在多场景时序图实验中，HTGN在动态链接预测任务上性能优越且内存成本降低50%。

Conclusion: HTGN通过高阶结构建模显著提升表达能力，为时序图分析提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have gained growing attention for
modeling and predicting structures in temporal graphs. However, existing TGNNs
primarily focus on pairwise interactions while overlooking higher-order
structures that are integral to link formation and evolution in real-world
temporal graphs. Meanwhile, these models often suffer from efficiency
bottlenecks, further limiting their expressive power. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Higher-order structure Temporal Graph Neural Network,
which incorporates hypergraph representations into temporal graph learning. In
particular, we develop an algorithm to identify the underlying higher-order
structures, enhancing the model's ability to capture the group interactions.
Furthermore, by aggregating multiple edge features into hyperedge
representations, HTGN effectively reduces memory cost during training. We
theoretically demonstrate the enhanced expressiveness of our approach and
validate its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments on
various real-world temporal graphs. Experimental results show that HTGN
achieves superior performance on dynamic link prediction while reducing memory
costs by up to 50\% compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态分析需要跨数据集的患者ID匹配，限制了碎片化数据的利用。本研究旨在突破这一限制，实现独立队列数据的整合分析。

Method: 通过统计方法识别各模态显著特征构建知识图谱，利用大语言模型分析图谱并生成自然语言假设。

Result: 发现代谢风险因素通过神经炎症与tau蛋白异常的关联(r>0.6)，以及额叶EEG通道与特定基因表达谱的意外相关性(r=0.42-0.58)，主要发现在独立数据集中验证稳健(方差<15%)。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了概念层面的跨模态整合，为通过碎片化数据理解AD病理提供了新途径，并生成可验证的研究假设。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and
knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched
patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level
integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators
from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features
in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then
analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in
natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including
a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities
via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between
frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58,
p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of
major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%).
The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review
(Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross
modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching,
offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented
data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

Motivation: 传统离散时间动态建模需要小的仿真步长来保持精度，导致计算量大且性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用时间扩展动作，将动作持续时间作为优化变量，结合多臂老虎机自动选择动作持续时间范围。

Result: 实验表明，该方法加快了规划速度，提供了更好的解决方案，并能解决标准方法无法处理的问题。

Conclusion: 直接控制决策时间尺度的方法在规划和基于模型的强化学习中均表现出色，显著提高了效率和性能。

Abstract: Continuous time systems are often modeled using discrete time dynamics but
this requires a small simulation step to maintain accuracy. In turn, this
requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding
planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free
reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats
where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we
propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using
temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the
action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action
variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up
simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon
search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the
planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting,
it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time
for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action
durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation
and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation
both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning,
better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved
in the standard formulation.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在解决不适定逆问题上表现出色，但许多方法未能严格遵守测量过程所施加的物理约束。

Method: 在学习的重建网络给出初始估计后，应用一个投影步骤，将解约束在逆问题的有效解空间内。

Result: 理论证明和大量实验验证了该方法在多种逆问题和深度网络架构中提高了重建精度。

Conclusion: 通过投影校正方法，可以显著提升深度逆网络在解决逆问题时的准确性和物理一致性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
illposed inverse problems; however, many fail to strictly adhere to the
physical constraints imposed by the measurement process. In this work, we
introduce a projection-based correction method to enhance the inference of deep
inverse networks by ensuring consistency with the forward model. Specifically,
given an initial estimate from a learned reconstruction network, we apply a
projection step that constrains the solution to lie within the valid solution
space of the inverse problem. We theoretically demonstrate that if the recovery
model is a well-trained deep inverse network, the solution can be decomposed
into range-space and null-space components, where the projection-based
correction reduces to an identity transformation. Extensive simulations and
experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating improved reconstruction
accuracy across diverse inverse problems and deep network architectures.

suffices for optimality, casting our problem as a particular MDP that is
equivalent to our original problem, as well as studying the computational

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，需要建立一个严格的理论框架来解释其经验性成功。现有的理论框架在通过统一的数学视角解释涌现现象方面仍然零散。

Method: 论文通过证明两个基本结果来建立LLM架构与算法信息论之间的联系：1）训练过程通过损失最小化计算近似Solomonoff先验；2）下一个token预测实现了近似Solomonoff归纳。并利用AIT统一解释了上下文学习、少样本学习和缩放定律。

Result: 理论洞察导致了一种原则性的少样本示例选择方法，优先选择模型预测置信度较低的样本。在多样化的文本分类基准测试中，该方法显著提高了性能，特别是对于较小的模型架构。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了理论基础与实际LLM行为之间的差距，为未来的模型开发提供了解释力和可操作的见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous
theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant
progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical
frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified
mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM
architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two
fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates
Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length
optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff
induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for
in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our
theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection
that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We
demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that
this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for
smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence
examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and
practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable
insights for future model development.

Motivation: 现有公平机器学习方法存在优化困难、调参成本高、难以处理多不公平度量等问题，需要更高效、可靠的解决方案。

Method: 采用平滑非凸替代函数逼近不可微不公平度量，并通过硬约束而非正则化实现公平性控制，支持多度量同时优化。

Result: 新策略能严格保证模型公平性，降低优化复杂度，减少调参开销，且能处理冲突的多公平性约束。

Conclusion: 该策略为公平机器学习提供了更实用、高效的实现路径，尤其在多公平性约束场景下优势显著。

Abstract: A new strategy for fair supervised machine learning is proposed. The main
advantages of the proposed strategy as compared to others in the literature are
as follows. (a) We introduce a new smooth nonconvex surrogate to approximate
the Heaviside functions involved in discontinuous unfairness measures. The
surrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and
is new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight
approximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed
to other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction
model in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to
optimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding
regularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a
strategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for
unfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of
regularization. (c)~Our proposed strategy readily allows for constraints on
multiple (potentially conflicting) unfairness measures at the same time.
Multiple measures can be considered with a regularization approach, but at the
cost of having even more difficult optimization problems to solve and further
expense for tuning. By contrast, through hard constraints, our strategy leads
to optimization models that can be solved tractably with minimal tuning.

Abstract: Certifying the IID generalisation ability of deep networks is the first of
many requirements for trusting AI in high-stakes applications from medicine to
security. However, when instantiating generalisation bounds for deep networks
it remains challenging to obtain non-vacuous guarantees, especially when
applying contemporary large models on the small scale data prevalent in such
high-stakes fields. In this paper, we draw a novel connection between a family
of learning methods based on model fusion and generalisation certificates, and
surprisingly show that with minor adjustment several existing learning
strategies already provide non-trivial generalisation guarantees. Essentially,
by focusing on data-driven learning of downstream tasks by fusion rather than
fine-tuning, the certified generalisation gap becomes tiny and independent of
the base network size, facilitating its certification. Our results show for the
first time non-trivial generalisation guarantees for learning with as low as
100 examples, while using vision models such as VIT-B and language models such
as mistral-7B. This observation is significant as it has immediate implications
for facilitating the certification of existing systems as trustworthy, and
opens up new directions for research at the intersection of practice and
theory.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies
within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective
deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations,
while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting
their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using
deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical
parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation.
Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity
data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same

trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern
propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal
distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a
noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to
develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while
providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior
knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator
provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed
estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by
establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the
sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are
validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to
derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under
distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training
objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and
the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen
and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms
for such task.

Abstract: We study the problem of creating strong, yet narrow, AI systems. While recent
AI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation
models, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be
valuable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two
challenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic
properties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.
The first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from
scratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes
necessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain
narrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend
on each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a
curriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge
regards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small
specialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized
to a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based
on pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a
regularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while
unlearning unnecessary skills.

Result: 在低数据量下对新图像和不同fMRI数据集均表现优异，支持自然语言查询到体素选择性的可解释映射。

Conclusion: BraInCoRL为视觉皮层建模提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，突破了传统方法的数据限制。

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a
fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural
networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational
alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of
visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The
necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition
limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL
uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot
examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We
leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable
number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple
subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context
learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our
model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher
visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing
voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel
images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also
generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different
subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates
better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending
to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables
interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

TL;DR: AM-PPO通过动态非线性缩放机制自适应调节优势估计，提升了PPO算法的稳定性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始优势信号存在高方差、噪声和尺度问题，影响PPO算法的学习性能。

Method: 引入AM-PPO，采用动态alpha控制器和tanh门控函数自适应调节优势信号。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，AM-PPO获得更高奖励、稳定学习并减少优化器裁剪需求。

Conclusion: 优势调制技术可广泛用于增强强化学习的优化性能。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning
algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and
efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant
variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning
performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO
(AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage
estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive
modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling
factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such
as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By
incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled
advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates
and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this
modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and
adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward
trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly
reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore
the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for
enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.

*Minglu Zhao,Dehong Xu,Deqian Kong,Wen-Hao Zhang,Ying Nian Wu*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于位置嵌入的模型，通过多尺度对称随机游走转换核来模拟海马体中的位置细胞编码，实现了高效的空间导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在重新概念化海马体中的位置细胞群体，将其视为近似多尺度对称随机游走转换核的位置嵌入，以更好地理解空间导航的神经机制。

Method: 模型通过梯度上升和自适应尺度选择，利用内积表示归一化转换概率，构建多尺度空间邻接关系，并通过矩阵平方从局部转换构建全局表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够捕捉位置细胞的关键特性（如场大小分布、适应性和重映射），并在复杂环境中实现稳健导航，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 通过建模集体转换概率而非单个位置场，该研究提供了一个生物可信且可扩展的空间导航框架，与海马体导航机制一致。

Abstract: The hippocampus orchestrates spatial navigation through collective place cell
encodings that form cognitive maps. We reconceptualize the population of place
cells as position embeddings approximating multi-scale symmetric random walk
transition kernels: the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle =
q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, where $h(x, t)$ is
the embedding at location $ x $, and $q(y|x, t)$ is the normalized symmetric
transition probability over time $t$. The time parameter $\sqrt{t}$ defines a
spatial scale hierarchy, mirroring the hippocampal dorsoventral axis. $q(y|x,
t)$ defines spatial adjacency between $x$ and $y$ at scale or resolution
$\sqrt{t}$, and the pairwise adjacency relationships $(q(y|x, t), \forall x,
y)$ are reduced into individual embeddings $(h(x, t), \forall x)$ that
collectively form a map of the environment at sale $\sqrt{t}$. Our framework
employs gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t) = \langle h(x, t), h(y, t)\rangle$ with
adaptive scale selection, choosing the time scale with maximal gradient at each
step for trap-free, smooth trajectories. Efficient matrix squaring $P_{2t} =
P_t^2$ builds global representations from local transitions $P_1$ without
memorizing past trajectories, enabling hippocampal preplay-like path planning.
This produces robust navigation through complex environments, aligning with
hippocampal navigation. Experimental results show that our model captures place
cell properties -- field size distribution, adaptability, and remapping --
while achieving computational efficiency. By modeling collective transition
probabilities rather than individual place fields, we offer a biologically
plausible, scalable framework for spatial navigation.

TL;DR: SecCAN是一种新型CAN控制器架构，将入侵检测系统(IDS)嵌入控制器数据路径，消除现有ML-based IDS的开销，实现零软件开销和低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车载网络协议(如CAN)易受攻击，传统IDS集成方案依赖ECU耦合或专用加速器，存在数据移动和软件开销问题。

Method: 开发定制量化机器学习加速器作为IDS引擎，嵌入SecCAN接收数据路径，优化IDS推理与协议接收窗口的重叠。

Result: SecCAN在AMD XCZU7EV FPGA上实现，可完全隐藏IDS延迟，检测多种攻击，资源开销低(<30% LUT, <1% FF)，能耗仅73.7μJ/消息。

Conclusion: SecCAN通过硬件集成IDS，为车载部署提供高效、低开销的安全解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network
protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine
learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation
technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is
non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units
(ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here,
initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the
controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we
present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability
within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap
messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the
bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised
machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into
SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference
with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA
to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack
datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the
CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with
state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low
energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs
limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (< 30% LUT, <
1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遗产由多种材料构成（如古老铝合金、木材和织物），其长期保存面临材料降解和腐蚀的挑战。需要一种针对多材料特性和博物馆环境定制的保护方案。

Method: 设计了一个基于知识的DSS，整合了材料降解/腐蚀机制模型（如木材损伤函数和铝合金腐蚀预测模型），并针对飞机展览/存储机库的特殊需求进行定制。

Result: 开发的DSS成功支持多材料航空遗产保护，并在捷克Kbely航空博物馆的二战飞机遗产案例中得到验证。

Conclusion: 该DSS为航空遗产的长期保存提供了创新解决方案，能够适应不同材料特性和博物馆环境需求，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The paper presents a decision support system for the long-term preservation
of aeronautical heritage exhibited/stored in sheltered sites. The aeronautical
heritage is characterized by diverse materials of which this heritage is
constituted. Heritage aircraft are made of ancient aluminum alloys, (ply)wood,
and particularly fabrics. The decision support system (DSS) designed, starting
from a conceptual model, is knowledge-based on degradation/corrosion mechanisms
of prevailing materials of aeronautical heritage. In the case of historical
aircraft wooden parts, this knowledge base is filled in by the damage function
models developed within former European projects. Model-based corrosion
prediction is implemented within the new DSS for ancient aluminum alloys. The
novelty of this DSS consists of supporting multi-material heritage protection
and tailoring to peculiarities of aircraft exhibition/storage hangars and the
needs of aviation museums. The novel DSS is tested on WWII aircraft heritage
exhibited in the Aviation Museum Kbely, Military History Institute Prague,
Czech Republic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究重放攻击对音频深度伪造检测的影响，揭示现有检测模型的脆弱性，并提供多样化的数据集以支持进一步研究。

Method: 通过构建ReplayDF数据集（包含109种扬声器-麦克风组合及多种声学条件），并测试六种开源检测模型在五种数据集上的表现。

Result: 最佳模型W2V2-AASIST的等错误率（EER）从4.7%飙升至18.2%，即使经过自适应房间脉冲响应（RIR）再训练，EER仍高达11.0%。

Conclusion: 重放攻击严重削弱音频深度伪造检测效果，现有模型需进一步改进以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and
re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make
spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this
phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings
derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations
across six languages and four TTS models. It includes diverse acoustic
conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six
open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant
vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate
(EER) surging from 4.7% to 18.2%. Even with adaptive Room Impulse Response
(RIR) retraining, performance remains compromised with an 11.0% EER. We release
ReplayDF for non-commercial research use.

TL;DR: AsynFusion提出了一种基于扩散变换器的框架，通过双分支DiT架构和协同同步模块，实现了音频驱动的全身姿态与表情的协调生成，显著提升了动画的自然度和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立生成音频驱动的面部表情和手势，导致动画缺乏协调性，显得不自然。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了AsynFusion框架，旨在实现面部表情和手势的和谐同步生成。

Method: AsynFusion采用双分支DiT架构并行生成面部表情和手势，引入协同同步模块实现双向特征交互，并使用异步LCM采样策略降低计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，AsynFusion在生成实时、同步的全身动画方面达到了最先进的性能，在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AsynFusion通过协调面部表情和手势的生成，显著提升了动画的自然度和实时性，为虚拟现实、数字娱乐和远程通信等应用提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical
task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of
interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality,
digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often
generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which
introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between
facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive
animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel
framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious
expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a
dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial
expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative
Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between
the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently
outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归语音合成模型因序列化token预测导致高延迟，难以满足对推理速度要求高的场景需求。

Method: 使用轻量级草稿模型生成候选token序列，通过SSD框架在目标模型中并行验证。

Result: SSD相比传统自回归解码加速1.4倍，同时保持高保真度和自然度，主观评估证实其感知质量无损。

Conclusion: SSD在加速推理的同时有效保持了目标模型的感知质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have
demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next
token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their
deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we
propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive
speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight
draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently
verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework.
Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of
1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high
fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the
effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model
while accelerating inference.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了AJailBench，首个专门评估大型音频语言模型（LAMs）越狱漏洞的基准测试工具，通过生成对抗性音频样本揭示现有模型的安全缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究缺乏对大型音频语言模型安全性的系统量化评估，尤其是在面对越狱攻击时。由于语音的时序和语义特性，这类攻击尤为复杂，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 研究首先构建了AJailBench-Base数据集，包含1,495个对抗性音频提示，覆盖10类违规内容。随后提出动态对抗变体生成方法，通过音频扰动工具包（APT）在时间、频率和幅度域应用定向失真，并利用贝叶斯优化确保语义一致性。

Result: 测试表明，现有先进LAMs在对抗攻击中均未表现出一致鲁棒性。即使微小且语义保留的扰动也能显著降低模型的安全性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要开发更具鲁棒性且语义感知的防御机制，以应对音频语言模型面临的安全挑战。

Abstract: The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and
risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content.
However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM
safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the
temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak
vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of
1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories,
converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech
synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and
reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further
strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we
propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio
Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency,
and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a
semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently
search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This
results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio
samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved
perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs,
underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense
mechanisms.

Conclusion: Moonbeam通过结合领域知识的标记化和相对注意力机制，在符号音乐理解和生成任务中表现出色，为音乐AI领域提供了强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Moonbeam is a transformer-based foundation model for symbolic music,
pretrained on a large and diverse collection of MIDI data totaling 81.6K hours
of music and 18 billion tokens. Moonbeam incorporates music-domain inductive
biases by capturing both absolute and relative musical attributes through the
introduction of a novel domain-knowledge-inspired tokenization method and
Multidimensional Relative Attention (MRA), which captures relative music
information without additional trainable parameters. Leveraging the pretrained
Moonbeam, we propose 2 finetuning architectures with full anticipatory
capabilities, targeting 2 categories of downstream tasks: symbolic music
understanding and conditional music generation (including music infilling). Our
model outperforms other large-scale pretrained music models in most cases in
terms of accuracy and F1 score across 3 downstream music classification tasks
on 4 datasets. Moreover, our finetuned conditional music generation model
outperforms a strong transformer baseline with a REMI-like tokenizer. We
open-source the code, pretrained model, and generated samples on Github.

Abstract: Ethical theories and Generative AI (GenAI) models are dynamic concepts
subject to continuous evolution. This paper investigates the visualization of
ethics through a subset of GenAI models. We expand on the emerging field of
Visual Ethics, using art as a form of critical inquiry and the metaphor of a
kaleidoscope to invoke moral imagination. Through formative interviews with 10
ethics experts, we first establish a foundation of ethical theories. Our
analysis reveals five families of ethical theories, which we then transform
into images using the text-to-image (T2I) GenAI model. The resulting imagery,
curated as Kaleidoscope Gallery and evaluated by the same experts, revealed
eight themes that highlight how morality, society, and learned associations are
central to ethical theories. We discuss implications for critically examining
T2I models and present cautions and considerations. This work contributes to
examining ethical theories as foundational knowledge that interrogates GenAI
models as socio-technical systems.

Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the
emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the
evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms
race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion
within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains
effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and
engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively
"experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may
eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel,
perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the
concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from
centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized
physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted
execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public
blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies,
memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing
resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital
"metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration
without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning
from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent
digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our
understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.

Abstract: AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive
education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special
Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences,
empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their
usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical
considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and
technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical
framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human
vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on
functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning
environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with
different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which
develops an AI-enriched interface to support children with text comprehension
difficulties. Our research strategy integrates ethical, educational, clinical,
and technological expertise in designing and implementing AI-based technologies
for children's learning environments through focus groups and collaborative
design sessions. We believe that this holistic approach to AI adoption in
education can help bridge the gap between technological innovation and ethical
responsibility.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DisCo的新方法，通过个性化扩散模型和解耦用户兴趣方面来应对冷启动场景下的捆绑推荐挑战，并在实验中显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 捆绑推荐中用户与捆绑包之间的交互稀疏性，尤其是在冷启动场景下，给传统协同过滤方法带来了巨大挑战。

Method: 提出DisCo方法，结合个性化扩散模型和解耦用户兴趣方面，在分布空间中生成捆绑包，并通过调整损失项避免生成模型在Top-K推荐中的偏差问题。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，DisCo大幅优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为冷启动推荐提供了一个有前景的框架和关键视角，相关材料已开源供复现。

Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However,
the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge,
especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods
do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on
interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a
cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a
personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the
user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to
tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an
additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the
generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments
show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on
three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework
and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation. Our materials for
reproducibility are available at: https://github.com/bt-nghia/DisCo.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出ThinkRec框架，通过引入思维激活机制和专家融合机制，将基于大语言模型的推荐系统从直觉型转向理性推理型，显著提升推荐准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的推荐方法依赖浅层特征匹配，容易产生表面化甚至错误的推荐结果，缺乏对用户行为深层逻辑的推理能力。

Method: ThinkRec框架包含：1) 思维激活机制（通过关键词摘要增强元数据并注入合成推理轨迹）；2) 实例级专家融合机制（根据用户潜在特征动态分配专家模型权重）。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，ThinkRec在推荐准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该研究通过模拟人类理性思维过程，为构建更精准、可解释的推荐系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more
semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing
LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like
manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click
history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often
leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we
propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1
to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking
activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and
injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable
reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying
user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this,
we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning
difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users'
latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users,
thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the
accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are
available in anonymous Github: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ThinkRec_LLM.

TL;DR: LSR模型通过DF-FLOPS正则化减少高文档频率词的使用，降低检索延迟，同时保持检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LSR模型（如SPLADE）使用FLOPS正则化鼓励稀疏性，但无法控制高文档频率（DF）词的使用，导致检索延迟增加。

Method: 提出DF-FLOPS正则化技术，通过惩罚高DF词的使用来缩短倒排索引列表，从而减少检索延迟。

Result: DF-FLOPS显著减少高DF词的出现，检索延迟降低约10倍，MRR@10仅下降2.2点，跨域任务中12/13表现提升。

Conclusion: DF-FLOPS使LSR模型在实际搜索引擎中部署成为可能，检索延迟与BM25相当。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors,
which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval.
SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage
vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure
sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very
high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production
retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To
address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS
regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage
of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval
latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword
removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of
high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that
DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers
retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while
maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and
cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).
With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step
towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学信息检索（MIR）在数学库定理搜索、数学论坛问答和自动定理证明等应用中至关重要，但缺乏统一的评估基准。

Method: 引入MIRB基准，包含语义陈述检索、问答检索、前提检索和公式检索四个任务，共12个数据集，评估了13个检索模型。

Result: 通过MIRB基准，分析了数学信息检索的挑战，并评估了不同模型的性能。

Conclusion: MIRB为数学信息检索系统提供了全面的评估框架，有助于推动针对数学领域的高效检索模型的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving
information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various
applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer
retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving.
However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has
been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information
Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB
includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval,
premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We
evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges
inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for
evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective
retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于距离的自适应波束搜索终止条件，替代传统的波束宽度条件，提高了图搜索方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于图的最近邻搜索方法（如HNSW、DiskANN和NSG）在实践中表现出色，但其性能与图的可导航性之间的关系尚未明确，且现有终止条件存在优化空间。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于距离的自适应波束搜索终止条件（Adaptive Beam Search），并证明只要搜索图是可导航的，该方法能近似解决最近邻问题。

Result: 实验表明，自适应波束搜索在多种数据集、图结构和目标最近邻数量下均优于标准波束搜索，显著提升了召回率。

Conclusion: 自适应波束搜索为现有流行方法提供了一种简单实用的性能改进方案，建立了可导航性与图搜索性能之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information
retrieval, and databases. For high-dimensional datasets, graph-based methods
such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical
accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the
dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given
query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and
theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We
propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace
the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the
search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is
guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a
connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We
also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both
navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as
HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard
beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and
target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way
to improve the performance of popular methods.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义kappa指数和对数函数的三参数非高斯概率密度函数家族，称为kappa-对数正态分布，用于建模具有偏斜频率直方图和厚尾的数据。该分布通过参数kappa控制右尾的轻重，并能生成双峰分布。论文推导了其统计函数的闭式解析表达式，并探讨了在时间序列预测和空间插值中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然和工程数据集中，经常观察到不对称和非高斯的概率分布。虽然对数正态分布是建模偏斜和厚尾数据的标准模型，但其在高值处的概率密度和风险函数的渐近依赖性受到严格限制。因此，需要更灵活的分布模型来更好地拟合实际数据。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于广义kappa指数和对数函数的三参数非高斯概率密度函数家族，称为kappa-对数正态分布。通过参数kappa控制分布的右尾轻重，并推导了其统计函数的闭式解析表达式。此外，还利用Jacobi多元定理构建了kappa-对数正态随机过程的联合概率密度函数。

Result: kappa-对数正态分布能够生成比对数正态分布更轻的右尾，并且在特定参数组合下可以生成双峰分布。论文还推导了其矩的边界和级数展开，并提供了负对数似然的梯度和Hessian矩阵的显式表达式，以方便参数的最大似然估计。

Conclusion: kappa-对数正态分布为建模偏斜分布提供了一种灵活的工具，适用于各种科学和工程领域。其在时间序列预测和空间插值中的应用展示了其实际价值。

Abstract: Asymmetric, non-Gaussian probability distributions are often observed in the
analysis of natural and engineering datasets. The lognormal distribution is a
standard model for data with skewed frequency histograms and fat tails.
However, the lognormal law severely restricts the asymptotic dependence of the
probability density and the hazard function for high values. Herein we present
a family of three-parameter non-Gaussian probability density functions that are
based on generalized kappa-exponential and kappa-logarithm functions and
investigate its mathematical properties. These kappa-lognormal densities
represent continuous deformations of the lognormal with lighter right tails,
controlled by the parameter kappa. In addition, bimodal distributions are
obtained for certain parameter combinations. We derive closed-form analytic
expressions for the main statistical functions of the kappa-lognormal
distribution. For the moments, we derive bounds that are based on
hypergeometric functions as well as series expansions. Explicit expressions for
the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood are obtained to
facilitate numerical maximum-likelihood estimates of the kappa-lognormal
parameters from data. We also formulate a joint probability density function
for kappa-lognormal stochastic processes by applying Jacobi's multivariate
theorem to a latent Gaussian process. Estimation of the kappa-lognormal
distribution based on synthetic and real data is explored. Furthermore, we
investigate applications of kappa-lognormal processes with different covariance
kernels in time series forecasting and spatial interpolation using warped
Gaussian process regression. Our results are of practical interest for modeling
skewed distributions in various scientific and engineering fields.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的模块化高斯过程（JGP）方法，用于处理具有突变的数据，避免了联合推断的复杂性，同时保留了关键特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程（GP）假设数据平稳，难以处理具有突变的数据。虽然已有跳变高斯过程（JGP）方法，但其联合建模复杂。本文旨在简化JGP，保留其核心优势。

Method: 采用模块化方法，避免联合推断，但保留JGP的两个关键特性：(a) 学习局部最优邻域大小以处理不连续性；(b) 引入基于聚类的潜在特征来捕捉突变两侧的不同输出水平区域。

Result: 实验表明，(a)和(b)分别显著提升了突变数据的建模效果，二者结合时效果更佳，且无需联合推断。

Conclusion: 模块化JGP方法简化了建模过程，同时有效处理了突变数据，在合成和真实数据上均表现出色。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) furnish accurate nonlinear predictions with
well-calibrated uncertainty. However, the typical GP setup has a built-in
stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes
with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was
developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent
"level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can
be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular
setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a)
learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of
discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions
of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of
(a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes
with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is
compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the
recent literature.

Motivation: 形式化方法依赖人工证明和专家知识，阻碍了其广泛应用。大语言模型为自动化定理证明提供了新机遇，但现有工作未尝试结合整体证明生成与策略式生成两种方法。

Method: HybridProver框架首先生成整体证明候选，从中提取证明草图，再通过策略式生成模型结合自动化工具逐步完善草图。

Result: 在miniF2F数据集上达到59.4%的成功率，超过之前56.1%的最高水平。消融研究表明，结合两种生成方法是取得这一结果的关键。

Conclusion: HybridProver通过结合整体证明生成与策略式生成，有效提升自动化定理证明性能。数据集质量、训练参数和采样多样性对结果有重要影响。

Abstract: Formal methods is pivotal for verifying the reliability of critical systems
through rigorous mathematical proofs. However, its adoption is hindered by
labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem
provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are
generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an
LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In
this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework
that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the
benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for
evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It
then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to
complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for
the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle
datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's
effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous
SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable
to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how
the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the
final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code,
datasets, and LLMs are open source.

Motivation: 现有数据集多针对单一物种且规模小，难以解决广泛类群中形态相似物种的识别难题。CrypticBio通过社区标注趋势构建，填补了这一空白。

Method: 从iNaturalist社区标注中筛选物种误识别数据，整合科学/多文化术语、层级分类、时空上下文等多模态信息，并提供开源数据管道CrypticBio-Curate。

Result: 在常见/未见/濒危/入侵物种子集上测试前沿基础模型，证明地理上下文对视觉-语言零样本学习识别混淆物种有显著提升作用。

Conclusion: CrypticBio通过大规模多模态数据推动生物多样性AI发展，解决物种模糊性挑战，并为现实场景应用提供支持。

Abstract: We present CrypticBio, the largest publicly available multimodal dataset of
visually confusing species, specifically curated to support the development of
AI models in the context of biodiversity applications. Visually confusing or
cryptic species are groups of two or more taxa that are nearly
indistinguishable based on visual characteristics alone. While much existing
work addresses taxonomic identification in a broad sense, datasets that
directly address the morphological confusion of cryptic species are small,
manually curated, and target only a single taxon. Thus, the challenge of
identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains
unaddressed. Curated from real-world trends in species misidentification among
community annotators of iNaturalist, CrypticBio contains 52K unique cryptic
groups spanning 67K species, represented in 166 million images. Rich
research-grade image annotations--including scientific, multicultural, and
multilingual species terminology, hierarchical taxonomy, spatiotemporal
context, and associated cryptic groups--address multimodal AI in biodiversity
research. For easy dataset curation, we provide an open-source pipeline
CrypticBio-Curate. The multimodal nature of the dataset beyond vision-language
arises from the integration of geographical and temporal data as complementary
cues to identifying cryptic species. To highlight the importance of the
dataset, we benchmark a suite of state-of-the-art foundation models across
CrypticBio subsets of common, unseen, endangered, and invasive species, and
demonstrate the substantial impact of geographical context on vision-language
zero-shot learning for cryptic species. By introducing CrypticBio, we aim to
catalyze progress toward real-world-ready biodiversity AI models capable of
handling the nuanced challenges of species ambiguity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的空间评估方法OBPV，用于评估足球比赛中包括转换起始点在内的全场空间利用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间评估方法如OBSO主要基于得分概率，不适用于远离球门的区域，而这些区域通常是攻防转换的关键区域。因此，需要一种更全面的空间评估方法。

Method: OBPV通过引入场地价值模型评估全场空间，并采用转换核模型，通过核密度估计传球分布来反映位置特异性。

Result: 实验使用La Liga 2023/24赛季的数据显示，OBPV能够有效突出反击中的空间利用，并揭示球队在攻防转换后利用空间的特定风格。

Conclusion: OBPV提供了一种更全面的空间评估方法，特别适用于分析攻防转换时的空间利用效果，揭示了球队在转换中的战术特点。

Abstract: Soccer is a sport played on a pitch where effective use of space is crucial.
Decision-making during transitions, when possession switches between teams, has
been increasingly important, but research on space evaluation in these moments
has been limited. Recent space evaluation methods such as OBSO (Off-Ball
Scoring Opportunity) use scoring probability, so it is not well-suited for
assessing areas far from the goal, where transitions typically occur. In this
paper, we propose OBPV (Off-Ball Positioning Value) to evaluate space across
the pitch, including the starting points of transitions. OBPV extends OBSO by
introducing the field value model, which evaluates the entire pitch, and by
employing the transition kernel model, which reflects positional specificity
through kernel density estimation of pass distributions. Experiments using La
Liga 2023/24 season tracking and event data show that OBPV highlights effective
space utilization during counter-attacks and reveals team-specific
characteristics in how the teams utilize space after positive and negative
transitions.

Motivation: ComBAT虽为MRI数据标准化的主流方法，但其依赖的假设条件若被违反会导致结果偏差。研究旨在明确这些假设，并探索如何优化人口结构以提升方法可靠性。

Method: 使用改进的Pairwise-ComBAT方法进行实验，评估人口规模、年龄分布、协变量缺失及偏差幅度等因素对结果的影响。

Result: 实验揭示了不同人口特征对ComBAT效果的具体影响，并据此提出五项关键建议，以增强标准化的一致性和可重复性。

Conclusion: 通过优化人口结构和严格遵循假设条件，ComBAT的标准化效果可显著提升，这对开放科学和临床部署至关重要。

Abstract: Over the years, ComBAT has become the standard method for harmonizing
MRI-derived measurements, with its ability to compensate for site-related
additive and multiplicative biases while preserving biological variability.
However, ComBAT relies on a set of assumptions that, when violated, can result
in flawed harmonization. In this paper, we thoroughly review ComBAT's
mathematical foundation, outlining these assumptions, and exploring their
implications for the demographic composition necessary for optimal results.
  Through a series of experiments involving a slightly modified version of
ComBAT called Pairwise-ComBAT tailored for normative modeling applications, we
assess the impact of various population characteristics, including population
size, age distribution, the absence of certain covariates, and the magnitude of
additive and multiplicative factors. Based on these experiments, we present
five essential recommendations that should be carefully considered to enhance
consistency and supporting reproducibility, two essential factors for open
science, collaborative research, and real-life clinical deployment.

Motivation: 尽管政策制定者采取了多种措施来减少臭氧前体排放，但不同政策组合的有效性仍不明确。本研究旨在识别哪些政策组合在不同部门和地区最为有效。

Method: 采用结构断点检测与机器学习相结合的框架，分析全球臭氧前体排放数据，识别政策干预的效果，无需预先假设政策实施时间和类型。

Result: 研究发现，电力部门的结构性政策可减少NOx排放达32.4%，建筑部门中发达国家通过补贴与碳税组合减少CO排放42.7%，发展中国家通过融资与燃料税组合减少52.3%。VOCs减排最高达38.5%。混合策略可额外带来10%的协同效益。

Abstract: Despite policymakers deploying various tools to mitigate emissions of ozone

that couples structural break detection with machine learning to pinpoint
effective interventions across the building, electricity, industrial, and

prior assumptions about policy treatment assignment and timing. Applied to two
decades of global O\textsubscript{3} precursor emissions data, we detect 78,
77, and 78 structural breaks for NO\textsubscript{x}, CO, and VOCs,
corresponding to cumulative emission reductions of 0.96-0.97 Gt, 2.84-2.88 Gt,
and 0.47-0.48 Gt, respectively. Sector-level analysis shows that electricity
sector structural policies cut NO\textsubscript{x} by up to 32.4\%, while in
buildings, developed countries combined adoption subsidies with carbon taxes to
achieve 42.7\% CO reductions and developing countries used financing plus fuel
taxes to secure 52.3\%. VOCs abatement peaked at 38.5\% when fossil-fuel
subsidy reforms were paired with financial incentives. Finally, hybrid
strategies merging non-price measures (subsidies, bans, mandates) with pricing
instruments delivered up to an additional 10\% co-benefit. These findings guide
the sequencing and complementarity of context-specific policy portfolios for
O\textsubscript{3} precursor mitigation.

*Pingqing Zheng,Jiayin Qin,Fuqi Zhang,Shang Wu,Yu Cao,Caiwen Ding,Yang,Zhao*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出HDLxGraph框架，结合图检索增强生成与LLMs，提升硬件描述语言(HDL)项目中的搜索准确率、调试效率和代码补全质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型(LLMs)在处理实际仓库级HDL项目时性能受限，缺乏综合评估基准。

Method: HDLxGraph框架整合AST和DFG图表示，采用双检索机制，结合结构信息与语义检索，并通过任务特定微调增强扩展性。

Result: 实验显示HDLxGraph在搜索准确率、调试效率和补全质量上分别提升12.04%、12.22%和5.04%。

Conclusion: HDLxGraph有效提升LLMs在HDL任务中的性能，并发布HDLSearch基准数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware
design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and
debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects
with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this
end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph
representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow
Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view.
HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the
limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by
incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to
various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally,
to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce
HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world
repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph
significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and
completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based
RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are
available at https://github.com/Nick-Zheng-Q/HDLxGraph.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个评估AI代理在网络安全攻防能力的框架BountyBench，并在25个真实系统中测试了5种AI代理的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理如何改变网络安全格局，需要系统化的评估框架来量化其攻防能力。

Method: 构建BountyBench框架，设置25个真实系统环境，定义检测、利用和修补三类任务，并引入新的成功指标和难度调节策略。

Result: Claude Code在检测任务表现最佳（5%），OpenAI Codex CLI修补能力最强（90%），定制代理攻防较均衡。

Conclusion: 不同AI代理在网络安全任务中展现出明显的能力差异，防御型任务表现普遍优于攻击型任务。

Abstract: AI agents have the potential to significantly alter the cybersecurity
landscape. To help us understand this change, we introduce the first framework
to capture offensive and defensive cyber-capabilities in evolving real-world
systems. Instantiating this framework with BountyBench, we set up 25 systems
with complex, real-world codebases. To capture the vulnerability lifecycle, we
define three task types: Detect (detecting a new vulnerability), Exploit
(exploiting a specific vulnerability), and Patch (patching a specific
vulnerability). For Detect, we construct a new success indicator, which is
general across vulnerability types and provides localized evaluation. We
manually set up the environment for each system, including installing packages,
setting up server(s), and hydrating database(s). We add 40 bug bounties, which
are vulnerabilities with monetary awards from \$10 to \$30,485, and cover 9 of
the OWASP Top 10 Risks. To modulate task difficulty, we devise a new strategy
based on information to guide detection, interpolating from identifying a zero
day to exploiting a specific vulnerability. We evaluate 5 agents: Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex CLI, and custom agents with GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking. Given up to three attempts, the top-performing
agents are Claude Code (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,350), Custom Agent with
Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking (5% on Detect, mapping to \$1,025; 67.5% on
Exploit), and OpenAI Codex CLI (5% on Detect, mapping to \$2,400; 90% on Patch,
mapping to \$14,422). OpenAI Codex CLI and Claude Code are more capable at
defense, achieving higher Patch scores of 90% and 87.5%, compared to Exploit
scores of 32.5% and 57.5% respectively; in contrast, the custom agents are
relatively balanced between offense and defense, achieving Exploit scores of
40-67.5% and Patch scores of 45-60%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SmartAuditFlow是一种新型的智能合约安全分析框架，通过动态审计规划和结构化执行，提高了漏洞检测的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在代码分析和审计中存在幻觉和上下文感知能力不足的问题，需要一种更灵活、精确的解决方案。

Method: SmartAuditFlow采用Plan-Execute框架，动态生成和优化审计计划，结合迭代提示优化和外部知识源（如静态分析工具和RAG），提升审计精度。

Result: SmartAuditFlow在多个基准测试中表现优异，常见和关键漏洞检测准确率达100%，真实项目中已知弱点的覆盖率为41.2%，成功识别所有13个测试CVE。

Conclusion: SmartAuditFlow在自动化智能合约审计中展现出卓越的扩展性、成本效益和适应性，优于传统静态分析工具和现有LLM方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in code analysis and
auditing; however, they still struggle with hallucinations and limited
context-aware reasoning. We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute
framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit
planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing
approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow
dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique
characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing
strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected
vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The
framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured
reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing
hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision,
SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge
sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by
real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports.
Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on
common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive
coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and
successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs. These results highlight
SmartAuditFlow's scalability, cost-effectiveness, and superior adaptability
over traditional static analysis tools and contemporary LLM-based approaches,
establishing it as a robust solution for automated smart contract auditing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IKEA的隐式知识提取攻击方法，通过良性查询对RAG系统进行知识提取，显著提高了提取效率和攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统虽然通过外部知识库增强了语言模型的能力，但容易受到数据提取攻击的隐私风险。传统攻击方法依赖恶意输入，容易被检测。本文旨在探索一种更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: IKEA方法通过锚概念生成自然查询，并采用经验反射采样和信任区域定向突变两种机制，全面探索RAG系统的隐私知识。

Result: 实验表明，IKEA在各种防御措施下均表现优异，提取效率超过基线方法80%以上，攻击成功率超过90%。基于IKEA提取的替代RAG系统在多个评估任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: IKEA揭示了RAG系统中存在的重大隐私风险，为未来的防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge bases, but they are vulnerable to
privacy risks from data extraction attacks. Existing extraction methods
typically rely on malicious inputs such as prompt injection or jailbreaking,
making them easily detectable via input- or output-level detection. In this
paper, we introduce Implicit Knowledge Extraction Attack (IKEA), which conducts
knowledge extraction on RAG systems through benign queries. IKEA first
leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and
then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the
RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples
anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries'
relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which
iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further
exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's
effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in
extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate. Moreover, the substitute
RAG system built from IKEA's extractions consistently outperforms those based
on baseline methods across multiple evaluation tasks, underscoring the
significant privacy risk in RAG systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用中间模型检查点初始化GCG的白盒攻击方法，证明现有对齐防御存在脆弱性，需考虑更强威胁模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对齐防御虽能抵御如GCG等攻击，但搜索空间巨大且易陷入局部最优。论文旨在评估防御的未来鲁棒性，假设攻击者能获取部分对齐过程信息。

Method: 提出基于中间检查点初始化GCG的 informed white-box 攻击，利用梯度信息选择检查点，提升攻击效率和效果。

Result: 该方法在SOTA防御和模型上高效有效，能发现通用对抗后缀，证明现有防御存在可被利用的漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前基于对齐的防御方法脆弱，测试LLM安全性时需考虑更强大的威胁模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications
ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main
approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and
jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even
against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates
adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search
space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding
successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to
local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we
assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed
threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment
process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the
intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting
as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly
effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show
our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show
a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack
performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to
successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective
across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,
effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,
that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit
alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,
our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and
the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于上下文检索的安全防护方法（SCR），以增强大语言模型（LLM）对越狱攻击的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）容易受到越狱攻击，现有防御机制存在局限性，无法应对不断演变的攻击手段，因此需要一种更强大且可扩展的防护方法。

Method: 通过初步研究发现少量安全对齐样本即可提升模型鲁棒性，进而结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术，提出了Safety Context Retrieval（SCR）方法。

Result: 实验表明，SCR能够有效防御现有及新兴的越狱攻击策略，显著提升模型安全性。

Conclusion: SCR为LLM安全防护提供了一种新的可扩展范式，能够动态应对不断变化的越狱威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking
attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce
harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns
about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While
existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent
advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods
to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense
frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking
threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary
study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against
a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack
pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a
scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive
performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics,
contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合公共模型解码与安全验证的方法，以加速GPT的安全推理过程，同时保持隐私和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT的广泛应用引发了客户端和服务器的隐私问题，而传统的加密方法虽然能保护隐私，但带来了显著的性能开销。

Method: 通过公共模型生成候选标记，并利用私有模型进行安全验证，同时优化私有采样协议和模型对齐以提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三种公共-私有模型组合及不同网络条件下，实现了2.1倍至6.0倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证隐私和生成质量的前提下，显著提升了安全解码的效率。

Abstract: The wide deployment of the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) has
raised privacy concerns for both clients and servers. While cryptographic
primitives can be employed for secure GPT inference to protect the privacy of
both parties, they introduce considerable performance overhead.To accelerate
secure inference, this study proposes a public decoding and secure verification
approach that utilizes public GPT models, motivated by the observation that
securely decoding one and multiple tokens takes a similar latency. The client
uses the public model to generate a set of tokens, which are then securely
verified by the private model for acceptance. The efficiency of our approach
depends on the acceptance ratio of tokens proposed by the public model, which
we improve from two aspects: (1) a private sampling protocol optimized for
cryptographic primitives and (2) model alignment using knowledge distillation.
Our approach improves the efficiency of secure decoding while maintaining the
same level of privacy and generation quality as standard secure decoding.
Experiments demonstrate a $2.1\times \sim 6.0\times$ speedup compared to
standard decoding across three pairs of public-private models and different
network conditions.

TL;DR: 提出DraftAttention框架，通过动态稀疏注意力加速视频扩散Transformer，实现1.75倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型因注意力机制计算成本高，导致生成时间长，难以实际应用。

Method: 在压缩潜在空间中对特征图降采样，利用低分辨率注意力图引导稀疏注意力计算，并通过重排序实现硬件优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视频生成质量上优于现有稀疏注意力方法，GPU端到端加速达1.75倍。

Conclusion: DraftAttention有效降低计算成本，提升视频生成效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer-based video generation models (DiTs) have recently
attracted widespread attention for their excellent generation quality. However,
their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts
for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video
takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and
scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free
framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic
sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across
frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field
over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution
draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both
spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the
query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse
attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their
original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables
structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention
closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for
constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation
quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code:

Motivation: 自回归模型在视频生成中因需要大量token导致解码阶段开销大，尤其是MLP模块的推理延迟和相邻帧间的高冗余性。

Method: 提出FastCar框架，引入时间注意力分数（TAS）决定是否重用前一帧的MLP输出，并结合FPGA硬件加速器动态调度资源。

Result: FastCar实现超过2.1倍的解码加速，能效更高，且与稀疏注意力结合可提升高分辨率和长视频生成性能。

Conclusion: FastCar有效减少冗余计算，为自回归视频生成提供高效解决方案，特别适合边缘设备应用。

Abstract: Auto-regressive (AR) models, initially successful in language generation,
have recently shown promise in visual generation tasks due to their superior
sampling efficiency. Unlike image generation, video generation requires a
substantially larger number of tokens to produce coherent temporal frames,
resulting in significant overhead during the decoding phase. Our key
observations are: (i) MLP modules in the decode phase dominate the inference
latency, and (ii) there exists high temporal redundancy in MLP outputs of
adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose the \textbf{FastCar} framework to
accelerate the decode phase for the AR video generation by exploring the
temporal redundancy. The Temporal Attention Score (TAS) is proposed to
determine whether to apply the replay strategy (\textit{i.e.}, reusing cached
MLP outputs from the previous frame to reduce redundant computations) with
detailed theoretical analysis and justification. Also, we develop a hardware
accelerator on FPGA with Dynamic Resource Scheduling (DRS) based on TAS to
enable better resource utilization and faster inference. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms traditional
sparse attention approaches with more than 2.1x decoding speedup and higher
energy efficiency on the edge. Furthermore, by combining FastCar and sparse
attention, FastCar can boost the performance of sparse attention with
alleviated drifting, demonstrating our unique advantages for high-resolution
and long-duration video generation. Code:

Conclusion: 通过知识引导的多模态推理和实体级语义验证，推动了假新闻检测从特征融合到语义 grounded 验证的范式转变，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex
interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external
knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in
verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1)
Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting
local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge
and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that
integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach
leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for
global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further
enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant
entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed
through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing
the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for
fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded
multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and
NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to
semantically grounded verification. For reproducibility and further research,

Conclusion: SPENet通过形状感知和边界模糊处理有效提升工业场景分割一致性，平衡精度与效率，为实时检测提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation stands as a pivotal research focus in computer vision.
In the context of industrial image inspection, conventional semantic
segmentation models fail to maintain the segmentation consistency of fixed
components across varying contextual environments due to a lack of perception
of object contours. Given the real-time constraints and limited computing
capability of industrial image detection machines, it is also necessary to
create efficient models to reduce computational complexity. In this work, a
Shape-Aware Efficient Network (SPENet) is proposed, which focuses on the shapes
of objects to achieve excellent segmentation consistency by separately
supervising the extraction of boundary and body information from images. In
SPENet, a novel method is introduced for describing fuzzy boundaries to better
adapt to real-world scenarios named Variable Boundary Domain (VBD).
Additionally, a new metric, Consistency Mean Square Error(CMSE), is proposed to
measure segmentation consistency for fixed components. Our approach attains the
best segmentation accuracy and competitive speed on our dataset, showcasing
significant advantages in CMSE among numerous state-of-the-art real-time
segmentation networks, achieving a reduction of over 50% compared to the

Abstract: The combination of Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) with Vision Transformer
architectures has attracted significant attention due to the great potential
for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, a
substantial performance gap still exists between SNN-based and ANN-based

firstly uses multi-scale spiking attention (MSSA) to enrich the capability of
spiking attention blocks. We validate our approach across various main data

discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated
increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving
and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world
applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align
with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing
work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies
heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced
realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs)
using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory,
spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in
everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality
image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic
annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality
annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text.
For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \textit{moral judgment} and
\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral
violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive
experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses
a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current
state-of-the-art models. The full benchmark is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Ze1025/MORALISE.

Abstract: This paper attempts to explore human identity by utilizing neural networks in
an indirect manner. For this exploration, we adopt diffusion models,
state-of-the-art AI generative models trained to create human face images. By
relating the generated human face to human identity, we establish a
correspondence between the face image generation process of the diffusion model
and the process of human identity formation. Through experiments with the
diffusion model, we observe that changes in its external input result in
significant changes in the generated face image. Based on the correspondence,
we indirectly confirm the dependence of human identity on external factors in
the process of human identity formation. Furthermore, we introduce
\textit{Fluidity of Human Identity}, a video artwork that expresses the fluid
nature of human identity affected by varying external factors. The video is

Abstract: This study presents a robust framework that leverages advanced imaging
techniques and machine learning for feature extraction and classification of
key human attributes-namely skin tone, hair color, iris color, and vein-based
undertones. The system employs a multi-stage pipeline involving face detection,
region segmentation, and dominant color extraction to isolate and analyze these
features. Techniques such as X-means clustering, alongside perceptually uniform
distance metrics like Delta E (CIEDE2000), are applied within both LAB and HSV
color spaces to enhance the accuracy of color differentiation. For
classification, the dominant tones of the skin, hair, and iris are extracted
and matched to a custom tone scale, while vein analysis from wrist images
enables undertone classification into "Warm" or "Cool" based on LAB
differences. Each module uses targeted segmentation and color space
transformations to ensure perceptual precision. The system achieves up to 80%
accuracy in tone classification using the Delta E-HSV method with Gaussian
blur, demonstrating reliable performance across varied lighting and image
conditions. This work highlights the potential of AI-powered color analysis and
feature extraction for delivering inclusive, precise, and nuanced
classification, supporting applications in beauty technology, digital
personalization, and visual analytics.

Motivation: 在视频监控、机器人应用和自动驾驶等领域，预测未来视觉动态至关重要。

Method: ProgGen利用大型视觉语言模型合成程序，估计视频状态、预测未来状态并渲染为视觉帧。

Abstract: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real
world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for
future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics
applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing
plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual
context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of
video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of
neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging
the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In
particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate
the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to
predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the
transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames.
Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing
techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging
environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits
counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its
effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

Abstract: Urban forests play a key role in enhancing environmental quality and
supporting biodiversity in cities. Mapping and monitoring these green spaces
are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees
is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image
resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While
deep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,
their effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and
manually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in
sufficient quantity. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates
domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of
low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution
imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation
without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models
such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we
generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand
the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only
improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition
conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote
sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results
demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法直接基于密集鸟瞰图特征生成规划，导致效率低下且规划感知有限。

Result: 在NAVSIM和CARLA Bench2Drive基准测试中实现SOTA性能，且计算效率显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: iPad框架通过提案中心化设计有效平衡了自动驾驶系统的性能与效率。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving systems offer a promising alternative to
traditional modular pipelines by reducing information loss and error
accumulation, with significant potential to enhance both mobility and safety.
However, most existing E2E approaches directly generate plans based on dense
bird's-eye view (BEV) grid features, leading to inefficiency and limited
planning awareness. To address these limitations, we propose iterative
Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places
proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature
extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder
that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through
proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data.
Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks -
mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art
performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中难以将文本描述与疾病区域关联，主要由于注意力机制效率低下和缺乏细粒度标记表示。

Method: 引入DAP过程，利用视觉语言模型的可解释性图来识别适当的图像特征，从而增强疾病相关区域并减少背景干扰。

Result: DAP在三个主要胸部X光数据集上，无需额外像素级标注，将视觉定位准确性提高了20.74%。

Conclusion: DAP方法有效解决了医学图像中视觉定位的挑战，提高了模型的透明度和可信度，有助于深度学习模型在临床实践中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is the capability to identify the specific regions in
an image associated with a particular text description. In medical imaging, VG
enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features
corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and
trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical
practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with
disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of
fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate
two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background
tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the
global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local
disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and
disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective
Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a
VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies
disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference. Without any
additional pixel-level annotations, DAP improves visual grounding accuracy by
20.74% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three major chest X-ray
datasets.

Conclusion: DeepKD通过双级解耦和自适应去噪，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，为复杂场景下的知识传递提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation have emphasized the importance of
decoupling different knowledge components. While existing methods utilize
momentum mechanisms to separate task-oriented and distillation gradients, they
overlook the inherent conflict between target-class and non-target-class
knowledge flows. Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target
classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To
address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that
integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through
theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics
in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design
independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual
interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for
task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class
gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce
a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small
initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses,
following curriculum learning principles. The DTM jointly filters
low-confidence logits from both teacher and student models, effectively
purifying dark knowledge during early training. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO demonstrate DeepKD's effectiveness. Our code
is available at https://github.com/haiduo/DeepKD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AIGC技术的快速发展，尤其是视频生成技术，虽然带来了前所未有的创造力，但也增加了信息完整性、身份安全和公众信任的威胁。现有检测方法在通用场景中有效，但在以人为中心的视频中缺乏鲁棒性，且存在泛化能力差、扩展性有限和依赖人工监督微调等问题。

Method: 论文提出了AvatarShield框架，采用基于MLLM的可解释性检测方法，通过GRPO增强，设计了精度检测奖励和时间补偿奖励，避免了高成本文本标注数据的使用。同时，设计了双编码器架构，结合高层语义推理和低层伪影放大，指导MLLMs进行有效的伪造检测。

Conclusion: AvatarShield框架通过创新的方法解决了以人为中心视频检测的挑战，为AIGC技术的安全应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented
creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity,
identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while
effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos,
which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and
ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor
generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised
fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first
interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos,
enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully
designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it
effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise
temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder
architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact
amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect
FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes
synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous
evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments
show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both
in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric
video forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伴随语音手势生成方法仅依赖语音或文本等表面语言线索，忽略了交流意图的核心作用，导致生成的手势虽节奏同步但语义浅薄。

Conclusion: 该框架为数字人和具身AI提供了模块化的表达性手势生成基础，通过意图推理实现了更自然的人机交互。

Abstract: When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as
adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture
generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (\textit{e.g.}
speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the
communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs
that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Intentional-Gesture}, a novel framework
that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in
high-level communicative functions. % First, we curate the \textbf{InG} dataset
by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (\textit{i.e.}, text
sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using
large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the \textbf{Intentional
Gesture Motion Tokenizer} to leverage these intention annotations. It injects
high-level communicative functions (\textit{e.g.}, intentions) into tokenized
motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are
both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a
modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and
embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture

Result: 眼动提示在时间效率上优于边界框，但分割质量稍低，证明了其作为辅助交互模态的潜力。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪可作为3D医学图像分割的补充输入方式，平衡效率与精度，为临床应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images
is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer
treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on
manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study,
we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive
segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image
segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with
SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to
bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach
with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential
of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical
image segmentation.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在七个主流LVLMs和两个多模态任务上均有效，并揭示了LVLMs对某些语义的敏感性。

Conclusion: 论文不仅提出了一种有效的方法来识别LVLMs的敏感语义，还提供了有趣的发现，旨在激发更深入的研究。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep
models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain
interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models
more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to
specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may
be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as
``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this
paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models
(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and
various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently
search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)
and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.
Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation
operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models
into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each
input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as
reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.
Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide
interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire
further in-depth research.

Abstract: With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,
researchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have
demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through
data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an
attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a
normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor
attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned
low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this
problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR
images. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the
pre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications
to the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images
generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve
the effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a
backdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic
algorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack
success rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting
downstream tasks.

Abstract: Road safety is a critical challenge, particularly for cyclists, who are among
the most vulnerable road users. This study aims to enhance road safety by
proposing a novel benchmark for bicycle occlusion level classification using
advanced computer vision techniques. Utilizing a parts-based detection model,
images are annotated and processed through a custom image detection pipeline. A
novel method of bicycle occlusion level is proposed to objectively quantify the
visibility and occlusion level of bicycle semantic parts. The findings indicate
that the model robustly quantifies the visibility and occlusion level of
bicycles, a significant improvement over the subjective methods used by the
current state of the art. Widespread use of the proposed methodology will

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在安全关键场景中的可靠性，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 构建VERI诊断数据集（200张对比图像），通过两阶段协议评估14个不同规模的VLMs模型。

Result: 模型识别真实紧急情况成功率70-100%，但对安全场景误报率达31-96%，存在过度解读上下文的问题。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉误导场景中存在系统性偏差，需开发针对性方法提升安全评估能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
understanding visual content, but their reliability in safety-critical contexts
remains under-explored. We introduce VERI (Visual Emergency Recognition
Dataset), a carefully designed diagnostic benchmark of 200 images (100
contrastive pairs). Each emergency scene is matched with a visually similar but
safe counterpart through multi-stage human verification and iterative
refinement. Using a two-stage protocol - risk identification and emergency
response - we evaluate 14 VLMs (2B-124B parameters) across medical emergencies,
accidents, and natural disasters. Our analysis reveals a systematic
overreaction problem: models excel at identifying real emergencies (70-100
percent success rate) but suffer from an alarming rate of false alarms,
misidentifying 31-96 percent of safe situations as dangerous, with 10 scenarios
failed by all models regardless of scale. This "better-safe-than-sorry" bias
manifests primarily through contextual overinterpretation (88-93 percent of
errors), challenging VLMs' reliability for safety applications. These findings
highlight persistent limitations that are not resolved by increasing model
scale, motivating targeted approaches for improving contextual safety
assessment in visually misleading scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字原生PDF文档中文本和非文本元素的异构布局以及文本元数据的不精确性，使得文档布局的自动分析成为一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 论文引入了两种图构建结构（k近邻图和全连接图），并通过预训练的文本和视觉模型生成节点特征，避免了手动特征工程。评估了三种实验框架（单模态、多模态拼接和双分支多模态）和四种基础GNN模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，在双分支配置下使用k近邻图的GraphSAGE模型在每类和整体准确率上表现最佳，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究证实了局部布局关系和多模态融合在GNN中对数字原生文档布局分析的重要性。

Abstract: The automatic analysis of document layouts in digital-born PDF documents
remains a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous arrangement of textual
and nontextual elements and the imprecision of the textual metadata in the
Portable Document Format. In this work, we benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN)
architectures for the task of fine-grained layout classification of text blocks
from digital native documents. We introduce two graph construction structures:
a k-closest-neighbor graph and a fully connected graph, and generate node
features via pre-trained text and vision models, thus avoiding manual feature
engineering. Three experimental frameworks are evaluated: single-modality (text
or visual), concatenated multimodal, and dual-branch multimodal. We evaluated
four foundational GNN models and compared them with the baseline. Our
experiments are specifically conducted on a rich dataset of public affairs
documents that includes more than 20 sources (e.g., regional and national-level
official gazettes), 37K PDF documents, with 441K pages in total. Our results
demonstrate that GraphSAGE operating on the k-closest-neighbor graph in a
dual-branch configuration achieves the highest per-class and overall accuracy,
outperforming the baseline in some sources. These findings confirm the
importance of local layout relationships and multimodal fusion exploited
through GNNs for the analysis of native digital document layouts.

Motivation: 现有MDD方法存在模态坍塌问题，表现为模态内表示过度集中和模态间分布差距扩大，影响跨模态学习效果。

Method: 提出RepBlend框架，通过表示混合减弱跨模态监督的过度主导，并引入对称投影轨迹匹配实现模态间平衡优化。

Result: 在Flickr-30K和MS-COCO上，RepBlend显著优于现有方法，检索性能提升（如IR@10 +9.4），蒸馏速度提升6.7倍。

Conclusion: RepBlend有效缓解模态坍塌，提升跨模态对齐和模态内多样性，为多模态数据集蒸馏提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Dataset Distillation (MDD) seeks to condense large-scale
image-text datasets into compact surrogates while retaining their effectiveness
for cross-modal learning. Despite recent progress, existing MDD approaches
often suffer from \textit{\textbf{Modality Collapse}}, characterized by
over-concentrated intra-modal representations and enlarged distributional gap
across modalities. In this paper, at the first time, we identify this issue as
stemming from a fundamental conflict between the over-compression behavior
inherent in dataset distillation and the cross-modal supervision imposed by
contrastive objectives. To alleviate modality collapse, we introduce
\textbf{RepBlend}, a novel MDD framework that weakens overdominant cross-modal
supervision via representation blending, thereby significantly enhancing
intra-modal diversity. Additionally, we observe that current MDD methods impose
asymmetric supervision across modalities, resulting in biased optimization. To
address this, we propose symmetric projection trajectory matching, which
synchronizes the optimization dynamics using modality-specific projection
heads, thereby promoting balanced supervision and enhancing cross-modal
alignment. Experiments on Flickr-30K and MS-COCO show that RepBlend
consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art MDD methods, achieving
significant gains in retrieval performance (e.g., +9.4 IR@10, +6.3 TR@10 under
the 100-pair setting) and offering up to 6.7$\times$ distillation speedup.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的Vision Transformer架构——octic ViTs，通过引入八面体群等变性（反射和90度旋转）作为归纳偏置，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers（ViTs）已成为计算机视觉领域的主流架构，但其在计算效率方面仍有提升空间。本文旨在通过引入八面体群等变性作为额外的归纳偏置，进一步提升ViTs的性能和效率。

Method: 作者开发了octic ViTs，这是一种新型的ViT架构，采用了八面体群等变层。该方法在DeiT-III和DINOv2框架下，在ImageNet-1K数据集上进行了监督学习和自监督学习的测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，octic ViTs在显著降低计算成本的同时提高了性能。具体而言，ViT-H的FLOPs减少了约40%，同时分类和分割结果均有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入八面体群等变性作为归纳偏置，octic ViTs在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为Vision Transformer的进一步发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent efforts at scaling computer vision models have established Vision
Transformers (ViTs) as the leading architecture. ViTs incorporate weight
sharing over image patches as an important inductive bias. In this work, we
show that ViTs benefit from incorporating equivariance under the octic group,
i.e., reflections and 90-degree rotations, as a further inductive bias. We
develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and
put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through
extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show
that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also
improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in
FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and
segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaRL利用基于规则的强化学习优化视频理解中的帧选择，无需昂贵标注，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解方法依赖启发式或伪标注，成本高且扩展性差，需更高效、类人的学习框架。

Method: 通过规则强化学习训练帧选择器，采用迭代放大策略进行循环训练，以下游模型准确率作为奖励信号。

Result: 在VideoMME等基准测试中表现卓越，Needle QA任务提升近15%，时空定位能力显著。

Conclusion: ViaRL提供了一种高效、可扩展的视频理解方案，显著提升性能且无需人工标注。

Abstract: Video understanding is inherently intention-driven-humans naturally focus on
relevant frames based on their goals. Recent advancements in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have enabled flexible query-driven reasoning; however,
video-based frameworks like Video Chain-of-Thought lack direct training signals
to effectively identify relevant frames. Current approaches often rely on
heuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly
and limited in scalability across diverse scenarios. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViaRL, the first framework to leverage rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL) for optimizing frame selection in intention-driven
video understanding. An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform
alternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component
undergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities. ViaRL
utilizes the answer accuracy of a downstream model as a reward signal to train
a frame selector through trial-and-error, eliminating the need for expensive
annotations while closely aligning with human-like learning processes.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including VideoMME,
LVBench, and MLVU, demonstrate that ViaRL consistently delivers superior
temporal grounding performance and robust generalization across diverse video
understanding tasks, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. Notably,
ViaRL achieves a nearly 15\% improvement on Needle QA, a subset of MLVU, which
is required to search a specific needle within a long video and regarded as one
of the most suitable benchmarks for evaluating temporal grounding.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时实现自动驾驶性能和视觉语言推理能力，因此需要一种能够整合两者的新方法。

Method: ALN-P3框架引入了感知对齐（P1A）、预测对齐（P2A）和规划对齐（P3A）三种机制，在训练阶段对齐视觉标记与语言输出。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ALN-P3显著提升了驾驶决策和语言推理能力，取得了最先进的成果。

Conclusion: ALN-P3通过跨模态对齐机制，成功实现了自动驾驶系统性能与语言推理能力的双重提升。

Abstract: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into
end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either
driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to
achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified
co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast"
vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning
modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception
Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A),
which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs
across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment
modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during
inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X,
TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both
driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Squeeze-and-Recalibrate（SR）块的新方法，用于改进计算病理学中的少样本学习，减少参数数量并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中深度学习依赖专家标注，但标注稀缺。少样本学习虽减轻标注负担，但存在过拟合和特征误判问题，现有方法预处理复杂且计算成本高。

Method: SR块作为线性层的替代，包含低秩可训练矩阵（压缩路径）和冻结的随机重校准矩阵，减少参数并保持几何结构。

Result: SR-MIL模型在实验中表现优于现有方法，参数更少且无需架构改动。

Conclusion: SR块有效解决了少样本学习中的问题，提升了模型性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations
remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from
overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the
current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage
pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of
complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a
Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in
MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core
components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that
reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature
learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric
structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization
objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can
approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that
the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its
SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL
models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and no architectural changes.

Motivation: 现实世界中误导信息的影响源于创作者试图传达的潜在误导性叙述，因此理解创作者的误导意图对于多模态误导信息检测系统至关重要。

Method: 引入了一个自动化框架，通过明确建模创作者的意图（包括期望的影响和执行计划）来模拟真实世界的多模态新闻创作，并构建了包含12,000个图像-标题对的大规模基准数据集DeceptionDecoded。

Result: 对14种先进的视觉语言模型在三个意图中心任务上的评估表明，当前模型在识别误导意图方面存在不足，往往依赖于表面的跨模态一致性、风格信号和启发式真实性提示。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在多模态误导信息检测中需要意图感知建模，并为开发能够深入推理多模态误导信息的系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The real-world impact of misinformation stems from the underlying misleading
narratives that creators seek to convey. As such, interpreting misleading
creator intent is essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD)
systems aimed at effective information governance. In this paper, we introduce
an automated framework that simulates real-world multimodal news creation by
explicitly modeling creator intent through two components: the desired
influence and the execution plan. Using this framework, we construct
DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark comprising 12,000 image-caption pairs
aligned with trustworthy reference articles. The dataset captures both
misleading and non-misleading intents and spans manipulations across visual and
textual modalities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on three intent-centric tasks:
(1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3)
creator desire inference. Despite recent advances, we observe that current VLMs
fall short in recognizing misleading intent, often relying on spurious cues
such as superficial cross-modal consistency, stylistic signals, and heuristic
authenticity hints. Our findings highlight the pressing need for intent-aware
modeling in MMD and open new directions for developing systems capable of
deeper reasoning about multimodal misinformation.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管多模态思维链（MCoT）方法在提升大视觉语言模型（LVLM）性能和可解释性方面取得进展，但其改进机制尚未完全明确。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究视觉思维在MCoT中的作用。

Method: 研究首先揭示MCoT通过视觉思维（无论采用文本或交错格式）传递图像信息提升性能；随后定义并系统分析了四种视觉思维表达形式，评估其清晰度和简洁性差异。

Result: 发现不同形式的视觉思维在清晰度和简洁性上存在差异，导致MCoT改进效果不同；视觉思维作为图像输入与深层Transformer推理的桥梁，能促进更高级的视觉信息传递。

Conclusion: 视觉思维是MCoT改进的核心机制，其表达形式的质量直接影响模型性能。研究为未来MCoT的优化提供了理论依据和方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant success in
multimodal tasks, with multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) further enhancing
performance and interpretability. Recent MCoT methods fall into two categories:
(i) Textual-MCoT (T-MCoT), which takes multimodal input and produces textual
output; and (ii) Interleaved-MCoT (I-MCoT), which generates interleaved
image-text outputs. Despite advances in both approaches, the mechanisms driving
these improvements are not fully understood. To fill this gap, we first reveal
that MCoT boosts LVLMs by incorporating visual thoughts, which convey image
information to the reasoning process regardless of the MCoT format, depending
only on clarity and conciseness of expression. Furthermore, to explore visual
thoughts systematically, we define four distinct forms of visual thought
expressions and analyze them comprehensively. Our findings demonstrate that
these forms differ in clarity and conciseness, yielding varying levels of MCoT
improvement. Additionally, we explore the internal nature of visual thoughts,
finding that visual thoughts serve as intermediaries between the input image
and reasoning to deeper transformer layers, enabling more advanced visual
information transmission. We hope that the visual thoughts can inspire further
breakthroughs for future MCoT research.

Motivation: 由于缺乏水下领域专业知识，SAM及其变体在水下实例分割任务中表现受限，且高计算需求阻碍其应用。

Method: 构建UIIS10K数据集，提出UWSAM模型，通过MG-UKD方法蒸馏知识，并设计EUPG自动生成水下提示。

Conclusion: UWSAM和UIIS10K数据集有效提升了水下实例分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual
applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and
its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance
segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further
hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which
includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we
introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate
segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from
the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the
Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective
visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater
Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater
prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,
thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for
efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model
is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over
state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and
codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将局部图像篡改检测重构为视觉语言理解任务，为多模态内容真实性领域建立了新范式，并为后续研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial
for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion
models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations.
However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only
a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional
computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3)
No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection
techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation
pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited
image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models
and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision
Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image
classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that
fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets,
significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and
transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various
configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language
understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate
that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire
subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.

Result: 实验表明，提出的算法在传统准确性和不确定性准确性方面平均优于基线2-3%，并且实现了显著更好的校准效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全关键应用中具有增强深度学习模型可信度的潜力。

Abstract: Knowing the uncertainty associated with the output of a deep neural network
is of paramount importance in making trustworthy decisions, particularly in
high-stakes fields like medical diagnosis and autonomous systems. Monte Carlo
Dropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can
be easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD
often struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To
address this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by
integrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),
Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an
uncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of
uncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using
different backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various
datasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic
dataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%
on average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy
while achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning
models in safety-critical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理图像理解方法推理能力有限且计算负担大，难以应对复杂诊断场景。

Method: 采用双边强化学习框架：一支通过无监督学习增强推理能力，另一支动态分配计算资源。

Result: 在多项病理任务中平均性能提升41.7%，推理成本降低70.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架同时实现了诊断准确性和计算效率的突破。

Abstract: Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest
due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized
treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods
exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle
complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological
images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their
practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches.
One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the
model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales,
directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other
branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images
based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing
computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks
such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection.
Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement
with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法在场景特征编码过程中存在信息退化问题，限制了运动预测的准确性。

Method: 提出HAMF框架，将观察到的代理状态和地图信息嵌入1D令牌序列，设计统一的基于注意力的编码器，并结合Mamba模块解码。

Result: 在Argoverse 2基准测试中，HAMF实现了最先进的运动预测性能。

Conclusion: HAMF通过简单轻量级的架构，有效结合场景理解和运动预测，提升了自动驾驶系统的运动预测能力。

Abstract: Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DTown是一种无需训练的框架，通过单张俯视图生成高质量、一致的3D场景，解决了现有方法在几何一致性、布局幻觉和网格质量上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D场景获取需要昂贵设备或多视图数据，而现有生成模型在扩展到全场景时存在几何不一致、布局幻觉和网格质量低的问题。

Method: 采用基于区域的生成提升图像到3D的对齐和分辨率，结合空间感知的3D修复确保全局场景一致性和高质量几何生成。

Result: 在多样场景中，3DTown在几何质量、空间一致性和纹理保真度上优于Trellis、Hunyuan3D-2和TripoSG等先进基线。

Conclusion: 通过无训练、模块化设计，3DTown证明了从单张图像生成高质量3D城镇场景的可行性。

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view
data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative,
generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential
role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have
achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene
generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and
low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free
framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single
top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based
generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware
3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry
generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions
and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked
rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while
maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome
resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D
supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show
that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis,
Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and
texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality 3D town generation
is achievable from a single image using a principled, training-free approach.

*Andre Dourson,Kylie Taylor,Xiaoli Qiao,Michael Fitzke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VET-DINO提出了一种利用医学影像多视角特性的自监督学习框架，通过真实多视角配对数据学习视图不变的解剖结构，在兽医影像任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督学习主要依赖单幅图像的合成增强，而医学影像具有同一研究的多视角标准化视图特性，这为学习视图不变性和隐含3D理解提供了天然优势。

Method: 基于668,000个犬类研究的500万张兽医X光片，利用同一患者研究中的多视角影像对，构建视图不变性学习框架VET-DINO，实现从2D投影中推断3D解剖结构。

Result: 实验表明，相比合成增强方法，真实多视角数据学习能获得更优的解剖学理解能力，在兽医影像下游任务中实现最先进性能，并成功展示视图合成能力。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了利用医学影像领域特性（而非简单迁移自然图像技术）的自监督学习新范式，为医学影像分析开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training deep
neural networks, particularly in medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.
While current approaches typically rely on synthetic augmentations of single
images, we propose VET-DINO, a framework that leverages a unique characteristic
of medical imaging: the availability of multiple standardized views from the
same study. Using a series of clinical veterinary radiographs from the same
patient study, we enable models to learn view-invariant anatomical structures
and develop an implied 3D understanding from 2D projections. We demonstrate our
approach on a dataset of 5 million veterinary radiographs from 668,000 canine
studies. Through extensive experimentation, including view synthesis and
downstream task performance, we show that learning from real multi-view pairs
leads to superior anatomical understanding compared to purely synthetic
augmentations. VET-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on various
veterinary imaging tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
self-supervised learning in medical imaging that leverages domain-specific
properties rather than merely adapting natural image techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互联网增强的文本到图像生成框架（IA-T2I），通过检索参考图像解决T2I模型在知识不确定时的生成问题，实验表明其性能优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像（T2I）生成模型在文本提示隐含知识不确定时表现不佳，例如无法生成未来事件的准确图像。本文旨在通过引入参考图像解决这一问题。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：主动检索模块判断是否需要参考图像；分层图像选择模块从搜索引擎获取最合适的图像；自反思机制持续优化生成图像以对齐文本提示。

Result: 在包含三类不确定知识（已知但罕见、未知、模糊）的数据集Img-Ref-T2I上测试，IA-T2I在人类评估中性能比GPT-4o高约30%。

Conclusion: IA-T2I框架通过动态引入参考图像有效提升了T2I模型在知识不确定场景下的生成能力，且评估方法接近人类偏好。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) generation models achieve promising results, but
they fail on the scenarios where the knowledge implied in the text prompt is
uncertain. For example, a T2I model released in February would struggle to
generate a suitable poster for a movie premiering in April, because the
character designs and styles are uncertain to the model. To solve this problem,
we propose an Internet-Augmented text-to-image generation (IA-T2I) framework to
compel T2I models clear about such uncertain knowledge by providing them with
reference images. Specifically, an active retrieval module is designed to
determine whether a reference image is needed based on the given text prompt; a
hierarchical image selection module is introduced to find the most suitable
image returned by an image search engine to enhance the T2I model; a
self-reflection mechanism is presented to continuously evaluate and refine the
generated image to ensure faithful alignment with the text prompt. To evaluate
the proposed framework's performance, we collect a dataset named Img-Ref-T2I,
where text prompts include three types of uncertain knowledge: (1) known but
rare. (2) unknown. (3) ambiguous. Moreover, we carefully craft a complex prompt
to guide GPT-4o in making preference evaluation, which has been shown to have
an evaluation accuracy similar to that of human preference evaluation.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
outperforming GPT-4o by about 30% in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在预训练过程中学习到的物体边界和场景组合知识，如何被重新用于通用的感知组织任务，特别是在未见过的物体类型和风格上的分割能力。

Method: 使用实例着色损失对Stable Diffusion和MAE模型进行微调，专注于室内家具和汽车等少数物体类型，以实现类别无关的实例分割。

Result: 模型在未见过的物体类型和风格上表现出色，分割精度接近有监督的SAM模型，且在精细结构和模糊边界的分割上表现更优。

Conclusion: 生成模型学习到了一种内在的分组机制，能够跨类别和领域迁移，即使没有互联网规模的预训练。

Abstract: By pretraining to synthesize coherent images from perturbed inputs,
generative models inherently learn to understand object boundaries and scene
compositions. How can we repurpose these generative representations for
general-purpose perceptual organization? We finetune Stable Diffusion and MAE
(encoder+decoder) for category-agnostic instance segmentation using our
instance coloring loss exclusively on a narrow set of object types (indoor
furnishings and cars). Surprisingly, our models exhibit strong zero-shot
generalization, accurately segmenting objects of types and styles unseen in
finetuning (and in many cases, MAE's ImageNet-1K pretraining too). Our
best-performing models closely approach the heavily supervised SAM when
evaluated on unseen object types and styles, and outperform it when segmenting
fine structures and ambiguous boundaries. In contrast, existing promptable
segmentation architectures or discriminatively pretrained models fail to
generalize. This suggests that generative models learn an inherent grouping
mechanism that transfers across categories and domains, even without
internet-scale pretraining. Code, pretrained models, and demos are available on
our website.

*Debarshi Brahma,Anuska Roy,Soma Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PromptMargin方法，通过少量标注样本微调视觉-语言基础模型，提升其在目标数据集上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言基础模型（如CLIP、ALIGN）在大规模数据上预训练后表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，但在目标数据集分布和类别差异较大时，微调这些模型面临过拟合和泛化能力下降的问题。本文旨在探索如何利用少量标注样本有效适应这些模型。

Method: 提出PromptMargin方法，包含两个主要模块：1）选择性增强策略，补充少量训练样本；2）多模态边界正则化器，通过增大类间间隔提升分类判别能力。

Result: 在15个目标基准数据集上的实验表明，PromptMargin在分布偏移程度不同的情况下，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PromptMargin通过文本和视觉提示的联合优化，有效解决了大规模视觉-语言模型在少量标注数据下的适应问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN, which are
pre-trained on large-scale data have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization
to diverse datasets with different classes and even domains. In this work, we
take a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target
datasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these
models have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target
dataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging
due to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not
been well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such
models are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on
various downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a
target dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further
fine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by
analyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we
propose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such
large-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples. PromptMargin effectively
tunes the text as well as visual prompts for this task, and has two main
modules: 1) Firstly, we use a selective augmentation strategy to complement the
few training samples in each task; 2) Additionally, to ensure robust training
in the presence of unfamiliar class names, we increase the inter-class margin
for improved class discrimination using a novel Multimodal Margin Regularizer.
Extensive experiments and analysis across fifteen target benchmark datasets,
with varying degrees of distribution shifts from natural images, shows the
effectiveness of the proposed framework over the existing state-of-the-art
approaches applied to this setting. github.com/debarshigit/PromptMargin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本负样本，忽视视觉负样本的重要性，且未考虑样本难度差异，导致模型在复杂任务上表现不佳。

Method: AHNPL将文本硬负样本转换为视觉域负样本，并引入多模态硬负样本损失和动态边界损失，优化模型对困难样本的区分能力。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，AHNPL显著提升了视觉语言模型在组合推理任务中的性能。

Conclusion: AHNPL通过结合视觉负样本和动态难度调整，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了模型的整体表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially
compositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained
semantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing
methods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative
samples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which
results in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts
the overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically
treated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the
alignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in
aligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Hard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard
negatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based
negatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.
AHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard
negative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within
each modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin
according to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample
pairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method
effectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is
available at https://github.com/nynu-BDAI/AHNPL.

Motivation: 量子退火器在解决组合优化问题时表现出潜力，但其性能受限于可扩展性和错误率。因此，需要一种工具来模拟和优化量子退火过程。

Method: 提出神经量子数字孪生（NQDT）框架，重建量子多体系统的能量景观，模拟基态和激发态动力学。

Conclusion: 基于神经网络的数字孪生可作为诊断和优化工具，提升量子退火器的性能。

Abstract: Quantum annealers have shown potential in addressing certain combinatorial
optimization problems, though their performance is often limited by scalability
and errors rates. In this work, we propose a Neural Quantum Digital Twin (NQDT)
framework that reconstructs the energy landscape of quantum many-body systems
relevant to quantum annealing. The digital twin models both ground and excited
state dynamics, enabling detailed simulation of the adiabatic evolution
process. We benchmark NQDT on systems with known analytical solutions and
demonstrate that it accurately captures key quantum phenomena, including
quantum criticality and phase transitions. Leveraging this framework, one can
identify optimal annealing schedules that minimize excitation-related errors.
These findings highlight the utility of neural network-based digital twins as a
diagnostic and optimization tool for improving the performance of quantum
annealers.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经元同步放电的突触可塑性规则（SSDP），通过协调神经元群体活动来增强脉冲神经网络的稳定性和泛化能力，适用于多种网络架构并保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脉冲神经网络（SNN）的学习规则（如STDP）仅依赖孤立脉冲对，缺乏对群体活动的敏感性，导致在噪声和快速变化环境中稳定性与泛化性不足。受神经同步性在生物学习与记忆中的核心作用启发，作者提出SSDP以解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于神经元同步放电程度的突触可塑性规则（SSDP），通过调整突触权重促进神经元形成协同活动模式。该方法完全事件驱动，计算成本低，适用于从单层模型到脉冲ResNet和SNN-Transformer等多种架构。

Result: SSDP在训练中表现出从不稳定到稳定动态的突然转变，表明同步性可驱动网络收敛至平衡放电状态。实验证明其在多种网络类型中有效，首次将突触可塑性机制应用于脉冲Transformer。

Conclusion: SSDP是一种符合生物原理且高效的通用的SNN优化策略，为群体学习机制提供了新见解，适合神经形态计算部署。

Abstract: Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to
support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles,
spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for
low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning
rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity.
This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and
fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural
synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a
spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights
based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable
and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity
patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable
dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence
toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across
multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and
SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic
plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully
event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it
well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic
modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks,
resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while
maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a
general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights
into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC)
represents a promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence by
combining powerful natural language understanding with optimization and search
capabilities. This manuscript explores the synergistic potential of LLMs and
EC, reviewing their intersections, complementary strengths, and emerging

as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search,
demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes.
Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating
metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在高风险场景中的部署增加，其拒绝涉及伦理敏感提示（如仇恨言论或非法活动）的能力成为内容审核和负责任AI实践的核心。然而，用户可能对拒绝回应持负面看法，同时自动化评估在模型评估和训练中的作用日益重要。本文旨在探讨模型评估者是否与人类用户在评估拒绝回应时存在差异。

Method: 研究利用Chatbot Arena的数据和两个AI评估者（GPT-4o和Llama 3 70B）的评判，比较了不同类型拒绝（伦理拒绝和技术拒绝）的评分差异。

Result: 研究发现，LLM-as-a-Judge系统对伦理拒绝的评分显著高于人类用户，而对技术拒绝的评分则无此差异，这种差异被称为‘审核偏见’。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自动化评估系统中存在的‘审核偏见’，引发了对透明度、价值对齐以及自动化评估系统中嵌入的规范性假设的广泛质疑。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those
involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content
moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed
as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research
suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated
assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and
training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used
to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking
and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess
refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot
Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how
different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which
explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that
because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system
limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find
that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more
favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.
We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for
model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.
This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the
normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.

Abstract: This project examines the prospect of using AI-generated feedback as
suggestions to expedite and enhance human instructors' feedback provision. In
particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on
the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI
feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college
Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an
LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based
on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs
can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete
their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had
graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the
feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud
studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI
feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share
how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions.
The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to
generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered
that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite
grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss
the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and
presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel parametrization approach for aeroelastic systems
utilizing Koopman theory, specifically leveraging the Koopman Bilinear Form
(KBF) model. To address the limitations of linear parametric dependence in the
KBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global
linear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger
nonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the
proposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic
example and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively
interpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter
mechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data
is corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron
identified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter
system.

Motivation: 传统CFD求解器和现有替代方法在计算成本和内存需求上较高，难以满足工业应用中对快速、准确空气动力学预测的需求。

Result: 在AirfRANS和NASA Common Research Model数据集上的验证表明，MARIO在预测精度上比现有方法提高了一个数量级，并能准确捕捉边界层现象和空气动力学系数。

Conclusion: MARIO框架在计算和数据限制下能够提供快速、准确的空气动力学预测，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework for aerodynamic
applications based on Neural Fields. The proposed approach, MARIO (Modulated
Aerodynamic Resolution Invariant Operator), addresses non parametric geometric
variability through an efficient shape encoding mechanism and exploits the
discretization-invariant nature of Neural Fields. It enables training on
significantly downsampled meshes, while maintaining consistent accuracy during
full-resolution inference. These properties allow for efficient modeling of
diverse flow conditions, while reducing computational cost and memory
requirements compared to traditional CFD solvers and existing surrogate
methods. The framework is validated on two complementary datasets that reflect
industrial constraints. First, the AirfRANS dataset consists in a
two-dimensional airfoil benchmark with non-parametric shape variations.
Performance evaluation of MARIO on this case demonstrates an order of magnitude
improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods across velocity,
pressure, and turbulent viscosity fields, while accurately capturing boundary
layer phenomena and aerodynamic coefficients. Second, the NASA Common Research
Model features three-dimensional pressure distributions on a full aircraft
surface mesh, with parametric control surface deflections. This configuration
confirms MARIO's accuracy and scalability. Benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that Neural Field surrogates can provide
rapid and accurate aerodynamic predictions under the computational and data
limitations characteristic of industrial applications.

Conclusion: 多功能储备池计算方案能够有效维持异构复杂网络的动态，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: A new machine learning scheme, termed versatile reservoir computing, is
proposed for sustaining the dynamics of heterogeneous complex networks. We show
that a single, small-scale reservoir computer trained on time series from a
subset of elements is able to replicate the dynamics of any element in a
large-scale complex network, though the elements are of different intrinsic
parameters and connectivities. Furthermore, by substituting failed elements
with the trained machine, we demonstrate that the collective dynamics of the
network can be preserved accurately over a finite time horizon. The capability
and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are validated on three representative
network models: a homogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical phase
oscillators, and a heterogeneous complex network of non-identical chaotic
oscillators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前蛋白质序列优化方法依赖大量标记数据或替代奖励，难以在实际低通量实验中验证效果，因此需要研究更高效的小样本优化策略。

Method: 使用数百个标记序列-适应度对，评估了分类器引导和后验采样等策略，并将引导整合到类似贝叶斯优化的自适应序列选择中。

Result: 研究表明，即插即用的引导策略优于蛋白质语言模型的强化学习等方法。

Conclusion: 小样本引导策略能有效优化蛋白质序列生成，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that
maximizes desired quantitative properties in a combinatorially large design
space of possible sequences. Recent developments in steering protein generative
models (e.g diffusion models, language models) offer a promising approach.
However, by and large, past studies have optimized surrogate rewards and/or
utilized large amounts of labeled data for steering, making it unclear how well
existing methods perform and compare to each other in real-world optimization
campaigns where fitness is measured by low-throughput wet-lab assays. In this
study, we explore fitness optimization using small amounts (hundreds) of
labeled sequence-fitness pairs and comprehensively evaluate strategies such as
classifier guidance and posterior sampling for guiding generation from
different discrete diffusion models of protein sequences. We also demonstrate
how guidance can be integrated into adaptive sequence selection akin to
Thompson sampling in Bayesian optimization, showing that plug-and-play guidance
strategies offer advantages compared to alternatives such as reinforcement
learning with protein language models.

Result: 在字符串和列表合成任务中，TIIPS解决更多问题且生成更接近最优解的语法/语义，尤其在分布外场景表现优异。

Conclusion: 显式建模归纳与直推的协同性为通用程序合成开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress
through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches
generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can
then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output
values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves.
Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated
ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both
paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that
unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their
interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates
programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search
to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on
two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our
results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more
closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe
that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive
reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and
broader applications.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了CHAD框架，使其支持部分编程语言特性，如非终止操作和循环结构，同时保持其结构保持语义原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于将CHAD技术推广至支持数据类型、部分特性和迭代结构的语言，为反向模式自动微分提供严格的范畴语义。

Method: 通过引入迭代扩展索引范畴，将基础范畴中的迭代提升到索引范畴中的参数化初始代数，从而在目标语言的格罗滕迪克构造中原则性地解释迭代。

Result: 扩展后的CHAD变换保持了结构保持函子的唯一性，并证明了变换后的程序能正确计算反向模式导数。

Conclusion: 本文不仅推广了CHAD技术，还为依赖类型语言和容器范畴中的迭代结构提供了新的理解。

Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally
formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in
total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with
features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued
conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving
CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the
introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration
in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed
category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck
construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred
iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics.
Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique
structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the
freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the
Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each
primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this
transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax,
showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives.
Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within
dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary
motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types,
partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical
semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the
correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.

Motivation: 呼吸系统病毒感染对全球健康构成负担，但细胞免疫反应的保护或病理机制尚不明确。现有研究数据分散且缺乏标准化，阻碍了AI驱动的发现。

Method: 开发HR-VILAGE-3K3M数据集，整合来自GEO、ImmPort和ArrayExpress的微阵列、批量RNA-seq和单细胞RNA-seq数据，统一元数据、标准化预处理流程并进行质量控制。

Result: 数据集包含14136个RNA-seq样本，涵盖疫苗接种、接种和混合暴露等多种情况，支持预测模型构建和批次效应校正方法评估。

Conclusion: HR-VILAGE-3K3M为可重复的AI驱动研究提供了平台，加速系统免疫学和针对新兴病毒威胁的疫苗开发。

Abstract: Respiratory viral infections pose a global health burden, yet the cellular
immune responses driving protection or pathology remain unclear. Natural
infection cohorts often lack pre-exposure baseline data and structured temporal
sampling. In contrast, inoculation and vaccination trials generate insightful
longitudinal transcriptomic data. However, the scattering of these datasets
across platforms, along with inconsistent metadata and preprocessing procedure,
hinders AI-driven discovery. To address these challenges, we developed the
Human Respiratory Viral Immunization LongitudinAl Gene Expression
(HR-VILAGE-3K3M) repository: an AI-ready, rigorously curated dataset that
integrates 14,136 RNA-seq profiles from 3,178 subjects across 66 studies
encompassing over 2.56 million cells. Spanning vaccination, inoculation, and
mixed exposures, the dataset includes microarray, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell
RNA-seq from whole blood, PBMCs, and nasal swabs, sourced from GEO, ImmPort,
and ArrayExpress. We harmonized subject-level metadata, standardized outcome
measures, applied unified preprocessing pipelines with rigorous quality
control, and aligned all data to official gene symbols. To demonstrate the
utility of HR-VILAGE-3K3M, we performed predictive modeling of vaccine
responders and evaluated batch-effect correction methods. Beyond these initial
demonstrations, it supports diverse systems immunology applications and
benchmarking of feature selection and transfer learning algorithms. Its scale
and heterogeneity also make it ideal for pretraining foundation models of the
human immune response and for advancing multimodal learning frameworks. As the
largest longitudinal transcriptomic resource for human respiratory viral
immunization, it provides an accessible platform for reproducible AI-driven
research, accelerating systems immunology and vaccine development against
emerging viral threats.

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在推动动脉瘤研究，促进生物流体、生物医学工程及临床风险评估中的数据驱动方法发展。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are serious cerebrovascular lesions found in
approximately 5\% of the general population. Their rupture may lead to high
mortality. Current methods for assessing IA risk focus on morphological and
patient-specific factors, but the hemodynamic influences on IA development and
rupture remain unclear. While accurate for hemodynamic studies, conventional
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive,
hindering their deployment in large-scale or real-time clinical applications.
To address this challenge, we curated a large-scale, high-fidelity aneurysm CFD
dataset to facilitate the development of efficient machine learning algorithms
for such applications. Based on 427 real aneurysm geometries, we synthesized
10,660 3D shapes via controlled deformation to simulate aneurysm evolution. The
authenticity of these synthetic shapes was confirmed by neurosurgeons. CFD
computations were performed on each shape under eight steady-state mass flow
conditions, generating a total of 85,280 blood flow dynamics data covering key
parameters. Furthermore, the dataset includes segmentation masks, which can
support tasks that use images, point clouds or other multimodal data as input.
Additionally, we introduced a benchmark for estimating flow parameters to
assess current modeling methods. This dataset aims to advance aneurysm research
and promote data-driven approaches in biofluids, biomedical engineering, and
clinical risk assessment. The code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 针对医学应用的针对性适应至关重要，仅解码器微调是一个高效的基线方案，而全模型微调则能获得最佳性能。

Abstract: Medical image captioning is a challenging task that requires generating
clinically accurate and semantically meaningful descriptions of radiology
images. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) such as BLIP, BLIP2, Gemini
and ViT-GPT2 show strong performance on natural image datasets, they often
produce generic or imprecise captions when applied to specialized medical
domains. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP
model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the
fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and
a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific
fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative
and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention
maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the
contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings
highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and
suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong
performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while
full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.

Conclusion: TransMedSeg通过隐式语义增强和理论推导的损失上界优化，为半监督医学图像分割提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved significant progress in medical
image segmentation (SSMIS) through effective utilization of limited labeled
data. While current SSL methods for medical images predominantly rely on
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, they often overlook
transferable semantic relationships across different clinical domains and
imaging modalities. To address this, we propose TransMedSeg, a novel
transferable semantic framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.
Our approach introduces a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) module,
which implicitly enhances feature representations by aligning domain-invariant
semantics through cross-domain distribution matching and intra-domain
structural preservation. Specifically, TransMedSeg constructs a unified feature
space where teacher network features are adaptively augmented towards student
network semantics via a lightweight memory module, enabling implicit semantic
transformation without explicit data generation. Interestingly, this
augmentation is implicitly realized through an expected transferable
cross-entropy loss computed over the augmented teacher distribution. An upper
bound of the expected loss is theoretically derived and minimized during
training, incurring negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on
medical image datasets demonstrate that TransMedSeg outperforms existing
semi-supervised methods, establishing a new direction for transferable
representation learning in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: SAMA-UNet通过创新模块有效平衡了局部细节和全局语义依赖，提升了医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is
publicly available at GitHub.

Abstract: Mesh reconstruction is a cornerstone process across various applications,
including in-silico trials, digital twins, surgical planning, and navigation.
Recent advancements in deep learning have notably enhanced mesh reconstruction
speeds. Yet, traditional methods predominantly rely on deforming a standardised
template mesh for individual subjects, which overlooks the unique anatomical
variations between them, and may compromise the fidelity of the
reconstructions. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-template-based mesh
reconstruction network (ATMRN), which generates adaptive templates from the
given images for the subsequent deformation, moving beyond the constraints of a
singular, fixed template. Our approach, validated on cortical magnetic
resonance (MR) images from the OASIS dataset, sets a new benchmark in
voxel-to-cortex mesh reconstruction, achieving an average symmetric surface
distance of 0.267mm across four cortical structures. Our proposed method is
generic and can be easily transferred to other image modalities and anatomical
structures.

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of buildings, particularly at Level of

networks. This study focuses on assessing the potential of LiDAR data for
accurate 3D building reconstruction at LOD1 and extracting morphological
features from these models. Four deep semantic segmentation models, U-Net,
Attention U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepLabV3+, were used, applying transfer learning
to extract building footprints from LiDAR data. The results showed that U-Net3+
and Attention U-Net outperformed the others, achieving IoU scores of 0.833 and
0.814, respectively. Various statistical measures, including maximum, range,
mode, median, and the 90th percentile, were used to estimate building heights,
resulting in the generation of 3D models at LOD1. As the main contribution of
the research, the impact of segmentation accuracy on the quality of 3D building
modeling and the accuracy of morphological features like building area and
external wall surface area was investigated. The results showed that the
accuracy of building identification (segmentation performance) significantly
affects the 3D model quality and the estimation of morphological features,
depending on the height calculation method. Overall, the UNet3+ method,
utilizing the 90th percentile and median measures, leads to accurate height
estimation of buildings and the extraction of morphological features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学显微镜中高精度轴向粒子追踪存在挑战，传统单焦平面技术精度不足。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)分析双焦平面图像，无需预定义模型。

Result: 轴向定位精度达40纳米，比传统方法提升6倍，模型设计简单且性能强大。

Conclusion: 机器学习能将复杂图像转化为可靠数据，为科学领域提供灵活强大的工具。

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the
optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when
extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning
approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial
positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models.
Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times
better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple
design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses,
including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation
protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging,
materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how
machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.

### [396] [Lung Nodule-SSM: Self-Supervised Lung Nodule Detection and Classification in Thoracic CT Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15120)
*Muniba Noreen,Furqan Shaukat*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为'LungNodule-SSM'的自监督学习方法，利用DINOv2作为骨干网络，无需标注数据即可提升肺结节检测和分类的准确性，在LUNA 16数据集上达到了98.37%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是近年来最致命的癌症之一，早期肺结节检测对改善患者预后至关重要。然而，标注医学影像数据的稀缺限制了计算机辅助诊断（CAD）系统的开发。自监督学习可以利用大量未标注数据开发更鲁棒的CAD系统。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：首先在未标注的CT扫描上预训练DINOv2模型以学习鲁棒的特征表示，然后使用基于Transformer的架构对这些特征进行微调，以实现病灶级检测和准确的肺结节诊断。

Result: 在包含888个CT扫描的LUNA 16数据集上评估，该方法达到了98.37%的准确率，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的'LungNodule-SSM'方法在肺结节检测和分类中表现出色，证明了自监督学习在医学影像分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains among the deadliest types of cancer in recent decades,
and early lung nodule detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The
limited availability of annotated medical imaging data remains a bottleneck in
developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Self-supervised
learning can help leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to develop more
robust CAD systems. With the recent advent of transformer-based architecture
and their ability to generalize to unseen tasks, there has been an effort
within the healthcare community to adapt them to various medical downstream
tasks. Thus, we propose a novel "LungNodule-SSM" method, which utilizes
selfsupervised learning with DINOv2 as a backbone to enhance lung nodule
detection and classification without annotated data. Our methodology has two
stages: firstly, the DINOv2 model is pre-trained on unlabeled CT scans to learn
robust feature representations, then secondly, these features are fine-tuned
using transformer-based architectures for lesionlevel detection and accurate
lung nodule diagnosis. The proposed method has been evaluated on the
challenging LUNA 16 dataset, consisting of 888 CT scans, and compared with SOTA
methods. Our experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method
with an accuracy of 98.37%, explaining its effectiveness in lung nodule
detection. The source code, datasets, and pre-processed data can be accessed

### [397] [Machine Learning Derived Blood Input for Dynamic PET Images of Rat Heart](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15488)
*Shubhrangshu Debsarkar,Bijoy Kundu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究通过动态FDG PET成像技术，对52只大鼠（26只对照WKY大鼠和26只自发性高血压大鼠）进行了纵向研究，开发了一种15参数双输出模型，并利用LSTM网络预测MCIF，提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在克服传统模型依赖手动标注和参数确定的局限性，通过自动化方法提高动态FDG PET图像分析的准确性和效率。

Method: 研究使用半自动分割和LSTM网络，结合IDIF和心肌输入数据，通过k折交叉验证和中点插值技术优化模型性能。

Result: 采用中点插值的模型在均方误差（MSE）上比之前提高了56.4%，显著提升了预测精度。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种自动化方法，有效提高了动态FDG PET图像分析的准确性和效率，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Dynamic FDG PET imaging study of n = 52 rats including 26 control
Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and 26 experimental spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHR) were performed using a Siemens microPET and Albira trimodal scanner
longitudinally at 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12 and 18 months of age. A 15-parameter dual
output model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects
with peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of
model corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for
dynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are
its dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function
(IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To
overcome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then
formulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict
MCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and
compared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices
with two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2
representing lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV
blood pool. The resultant IDIF and myocardial TACs were used to compute the
corresponding reference (model) MCIF for all data sets. The segmented IDIF and
the myocardium formed the input for the LSTM network. A k-fold cross validation
structure with a 33:8:11 split and 5 folds was utilized to create the model and
evaluate the performance of the LSTM network for all datasets. To overcome the
sparseness of data as time steps increase, midpoint interpolation was utilized
to increase the density of datapoints beyond time = 10 minutes. The model
utilizing midpoint interpolation was able to achieve a 56.4% improvement over
previous Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### [398] [Uncertainty Quantification in SVM prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15429)
*Pritam Anand*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文探讨了支持向量机（SVM）预测中的不确定性量化（UQ）问题，提出了一种稀疏支持向量分位数回归（SSVQR）模型，用于构建预测区间（PI）和概率预测，并通过特征选择算法提高了高维数据集的PI质量。实验表明，SVM模型在概率预测任务中表现优于或与现代深度学习模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SVM解决方案通常比神经网络更稳定、稀疏、最优且可解释，但关于SVM预测中不确定性量化的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索SVM框架下的预测区间估计和概率预测方法。

Method: 首先总结了现有的SVM框架下的预测区间估计和概率预测方法，并评估了它们的性能。然后提出了一种稀疏支持向量分位数回归（SSVQR）模型，通过解决一对线性程序来构建预测区间和概率预测。此外，还开发了一种用于PI估计的特征选择算法，有效减少了高维数据集中的特征数量。最后，将SVM模型扩展到共形回归设置中，以获得更稳定的预测集。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有的SVM PI模型均未实现稀疏解，而提出的SSVQR模型在保持稀疏性的同时提高了PI质量。特征选择算法显著减少了特征数量并改善了PI质量。SVM模型在概率预测任务中表现优于或与现代深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SSVQR模型和特征选择算法有效提高了SVM在不确定性量化中的性能，尤其是在高维数据集中。SVM模型在概率预测任务中表现出色，甚至优于现代深度学习模型，展示了其在复杂预测任务中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in SVM predictions,
particularly for regression and forecasting tasks. Unlike the Neural Network,
the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable.
However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM
prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction
Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the
SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an
ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a
sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse
Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and
probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we
develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that
effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI
quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models
in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with
finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world
benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and
proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of
the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the
existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning
models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore,
SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep
learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.

*Soo Min Kwon,Alec S. Xu,Can Yaras,Laura Balzano,Qing Qu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文通过低秩协方差矩阵参数化的线性回归任务，揭示了上下文学习（ICL）在分布偏移下的局限性及其泛化能力的内在机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示上下文学习（ICL）在分布外（OOD）情况下的能力，特别是其对分布偏移的鲁棒性及泛化机制。

Method: 采用低秩协方差矩阵参数化的线性回归任务，通过理论分析和实验验证，探讨ICL在分布偏移下的表现及泛化能力。

Result: 发现ICL对协方差矩阵子空间角度的分布偏移敏感，但在训练任务向量来自低维子空间联合时，ICL能在足够长的提示长度下泛化到其跨度内的任何子空间。

Conclusion: Transformer的OOD泛化能力可能源于新任务位于训练任务子空间的跨度内，且LoRA能有效捕捉分布偏移。

Abstract: This work aims to demystify the out-of-distribution (OOD) capabilities of
in-context learning (ICL) by studying linear regression tasks parameterized
with low-rank covariance matrices. With such a parameterization, we can model
distribution shifts as a varying angle between the subspace of the training and
testing covariance matrices. We prove that a single-layer linear attention
model incurs a test risk with a non-negligible dependence on the angle,
illustrating that ICL is not robust to such distribution shifts. However, using
this framework, we also prove an interesting property of ICL: when trained on
task vectors drawn from a union of low-dimensional subspaces, ICL can
generalize to any subspace within their span, given sufficiently long prompt
lengths. This suggests that the OOD generalization ability of Transformers may
actually stem from the new task lying within the span of those encountered
during training. We empirically show that our results also hold for models such
as GPT-2, and conclude with (i) experiments on how our observations extend to
nonlinear function classes and (ii) results on how LoRA has the ability to
capture distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督GNN面临超参数敏感且缺乏模型选择方法的问题，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: LOBSTUR-GNN结合局部图依赖的自助采样和CCA一致性评估，构建无监督表示学习的调优框架。

Result: 在学术数据集上实现超参数调优后分类准确率提升65.9%，并在实际场景中验证有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为无监督GNN提供了可靠的超参数选择方法，具备理论和实用价值。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in conjunction with
unsupervised learning techniques to learn powerful node representations, but
their deployment is hindered by their high sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning
and the absence of established methodologies for selecting the optimal models.
To address these challenges, we propose LOBSTUR-GNN ({\bf Lo}cal {\bf B}oot{\bf
s}trap for {\bf T}uning {\bf U}nsupervised {\bf R}epresentations in GNNs) i), a
novel framework designed to adapt bootstrapping techniques for unsupervised
graph representation learning. LOBSTUR-GNN tackles two main challenges: (a)
adapting the bootstrap edge and feature resampling process to account for local
graph dependencies in creating alternative versions of the same graph, and (b)
establishing robust metrics for evaluating learned representations without
ground-truth labels. Using locally bootstrapped resampling and leveraging
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to assess embedding consistency, LOBSTUR
provides a principled approach for hyperparameter tuning in unsupervised GNNs.
We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method through
extensive experiments on established academic datasets, showing an 65.9\%
improvement in the classification accuracy compared to an uninformed selection
of hyperparameters. Finally, we deploy our framework on a real-world
application, thereby demonstrating its validity and practical utility in
various settings. \footnote{The code is available at

*Anupama Sridhar,Alexander Johansen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文首次为Adam优化器在深度ReLU网络中的非光滑、非凸环境下提供了理论保证，包括泛化边界和全局收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam等一阶自适应优化方法在训练深度神经网络中表现优异，但在非光滑环境（如ReLU激活函数）下的理论理解仍然有限。ReLU激活函数引入了大量区域边界，导致传统光滑假设失效。

Method: 论文基于分层Morse理论和Kakeya集的新结果，开发了一个多层细化框架，逐步收紧区域交叉的边界，并使用Kakeya方法提供更紧的泛化边界。

Result: 论文证明了在有效维度下，区域交叉次数从指数级降至近线性级，并展示了在温和的均匀低障碍假设下的收敛性。

Conclusion: 该研究为Adam在深度ReLU网络中的理论分析提供了新工具和结果，填补了非光滑、非凸环境下的理论空白。

Abstract: First-order adaptive optimization methods like Adam are the default choices
for training modern deep neural networks. Despite their empirical success, the
theoretical understanding of these methods in non-smooth settings, particularly
in Deep ReLU networks, remains limited. ReLU activations create exponentially
many region boundaries where standard smoothness assumptions break down.
\textbf{We derive the first
\(\tilde{O}\!\bigl(\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{eff}}/n}\bigr)\) generalization bound for
Adam in Deep ReLU networks and the first global-optimal convergence for Adam in
the non smooth, non convex relu landscape without a global PL or convexity
assumption.} Our analysis is based on stratified Morse theory and novel results
in Kakeya sets. We develop a multi-layer refinement framework that
progressively tightens bounds on region crossings. We prove that the number of
region crossings collapses from exponential to near-linear in the effective
dimension. Using a Kakeya based method, we give a tighter generalization bound
than PAC-Bayes approaches and showcase convergence using a mild uniform low
barrier assumption.

Motivation: 日常环境对健康和行为的深远影响促使研究者开发数字环境分型方法，通过分析个人日常环境图像来探索环境与健康的关系。

Method: 论文提出无限层次对比聚类方法，基于对比聚类框架，引入stick-breaking先验和参与者特定预测损失，实现无限制聚类和子聚类形成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效识别个人环境并将其分组为有意义的环境类型，进而与多种健康结果关联。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了环境分型范式的发展，为研究环境与健康关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Daily environments have profound influence on our health and behavior. Recent
work has shown that digital envirotyping, where computer vision is applied to
images of daily environments taken during ecological momentary assessment
(EMA), can be used to identify meaningful relationships between environmental
features and health outcomes of interest. To systematically study such effects
on an individual level, it is helpful to group images into distinct
environments encountered in an individual's daily life; these may then be
analyzed, further grouped into related environments with similar features, and
linked to health outcomes. Here we introduce infinite hierarchical contrastive
clustering to address this challenge. Building on the established contrastive
clustering framework, our method a) allows an arbitrary number of clusters
without requiring the full Dirichlet Process machinery by placing a
stick-breaking prior on predicted cluster probabilities; and b) encourages
distinct environments to form well-defined sub-clusters within each cluster of
related environments by incorporating a participant-specific prediction loss.
Our experiments show that our model effectively identifies distinct personal
environments and groups these environments into meaningful environment types.
We then illustrate how the resulting clusters can be linked to various health
outcomes, highlighting the potential of our approach to advance the
envirotyping paradigm.

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论分析线性回归中投毒比例和正则化的影响，通过QR逐步回归研究多输出回归中Hessian矩阵的谱特征，并在深度网络中实验验证理论的普适性。

Result: 研究发现Hessian矩阵的谱特征可以有效诊断数据投毒，且该理论适用于现代卷积和Transformer网络。基于此开发了无需重新训练的检测和修复算法。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和实验验证，提出了数据投毒检测的新方法，并展示了其在现代神经网络中的适用性，为模型安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the theoretical foundations of data poisoning attacks in
machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that the Hessian with respect to
the input serves as a diagnostic tool for detecting poisoning, exhibiting
spectral signatures that characterize compromised datasets. We use random
matrix theory (RMT) to develop a theory for the impact of poisoning proportion
and regularisation on attack efficacy in linear regression. Through QR stepwise
regression, we study the spectral signatures of the Hessian in multi-output
regression. We perform experiments on deep networks to show experimentally that
this theory extends to modern convolutional and transformer networks under the
cross-entropy loss. Based on these insights we develop preliminary algorithms
to determine if a network has been poisoned and remedies which do not require
further training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着变量数量增加和因果图复杂性上升，基于do-calculus的方法面临计算挑战，需要简化模型同时保留关键特征。

Method: 提出剪枝（移除不必要变量）和聚类（合并变量）作为因果数据融合的预处理操作，并推导多数据源下的应用条件。

Result: 给出了基于简化图推断因果效应可识别性的充分条件，并展示了如何为可识别效应获取对应的识别函数。

Conclusion: 通过流行病学和社会科学的实例验证了所提方法的有效性，表明剪枝和聚类能显著提升因果数据融合的可行性。

Abstract: Data fusion, the process of combining observational and experimental data,
can enable the identification of causal effects that would otherwise remain
non-identifiable. Although identification algorithms have been developed for
specific scenarios, do-calculus remains the only general-purpose tool for
causal data fusion, particularly when variables are present in some data
sources but not others. However, approaches based on do-calculus may encounter
computational challenges as the number of variables increases and the causal
graph grows in complexity. Consequently, there exists a need to reduce the size
of such models while preserving the essential features. For this purpose, we
propose pruning (removing unnecessary variables) and clustering (combining
variables) as preprocessing operations for causal data fusion. We generalize
earlier results on a single data source and derive conditions for applying
pruning and clustering in the case of multiple data sources. We give sufficient
conditions for inferring the identifiability or non-identifiability of a causal
effect in a larger graph based on a smaller graph and show how to obtain the
corresponding identifying functional for identifiable causal effects. Examples
from epidemiology and social science demonstrate the use of the results.

Motivation: 在折扣MDP中，策略测试问题的目标是在固定置信度设置下，判断给定策略的值是否超过指定阈值，同时最小化观察次数。现有方法面临非凸约束的挑战，难以设计统计最优且计算可行的算法。

Method: 作者首先推导了实例特定的下界，并将其重新构造为一个具有非凸目标但凸约束的优化问题。通过将其解释为反向MDP中的策略优化任务，并利用策略梯度方法高效求解，设计了一种策略测试算法。

Result: 所提出的算法在统计上是最优的，能够匹配样本复杂度的实例特定下界，同时保持计算上的可行性。数值实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过重新构造优化问题并利用策略梯度方法，本文成功解决了非凸约束带来的挑战，设计了一种统计最优且计算高效的策略测试算法，为MDP中的纯探索任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the policy testing problem in discounted Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the fixed-confidence setting. The goal is to determine whether the
value of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the
number of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound
that any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the
solution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a
policy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common
approach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where
asymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based
characterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the
non-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant
challenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and
computationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we
reformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective
and the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex
objective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits
an interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed
MDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently
solve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is
statistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample
complexity--while remaining computationally tractable. We validate our approach
with numerical experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级自适应熵门控对比融合层（AECF），在缺失输入场景下同时保持鲁棒性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态系统常面临输入缺失问题（如工厂机器人丢失音频、临床记录缺少检测数据），现有融合层无法同时保证鲁棒性和校准性。

Method: AECF通过（1）实例级自适应熵系数（2）强制所有模态子集的单调校准（3）利用训练时熵驱动课程掩码，所有骨干网络保持冻结。

Result: 在AV-MNIST和MS-COCO上，输入缺失50%时mAP提升18%，ECE降低200%，仅增加1%运行时开销。

Conclusion: AECF作为即插即用层，能实现鲁棒且校准的多模态推理。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal systems routinely face missing-input scenarios, and in
reality, robots lose audio in a factory or a clinical record omits lab tests at
inference time. Standard fusion layers either preserve robustness or
calibration but never both. We introduce Adaptive Entropy-Gated Contrastive
Fusion (AECF), a single light-weight layer that (i) adapts its entropy
coefficient per instance, (ii) enforces monotone calibration across all
modality subsets, and (iii) drives a curriculum mask directly from
training-time entropy. On AV-MNIST and MS-COCO, AECF improves masked-input mAP
by +18 pp at a 50% drop rate while reducing ECE by up to 200%, yet adds 1%
run-time. All back-bones remain frozen, making AECF an easy drop-in layer for
robust, calibrated multimodal inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测能构建高覆盖率的预测集，但无法提供单个标签的概率估计，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将问题建模为自适应校准任务，通过输入特定的温度参数匹配目标覆盖水平。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上验证，该方法在保持覆盖率的同时显著减少预期校准误差。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了共形预测集缺乏概率估计的空白，提升了实用性和校准性能。

Abstract: Conformal prediction enables the construction of high-coverage prediction
sets for any pre-trained model, guaranteeing that the true label lies within
the set with a specified probability. However, these sets do not provide
probability estimates for individual labels, limiting their practical use. In
this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method for
assigning calibrated probabilities to elements of a conformal prediction set.
Our approach frames this as an adaptive calibration problem, selecting an
input-specific temperature parameter to match the desired coverage level.
Experiments on several challenging image classification datasets demonstrate
that our method maintains coverage guarantees while significantly reducing
expected calibration error.

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合数据驱动的机器学习模型与基于物理的混合模型，显著提高了临界热通量（CHF）预测的准确性，并在核反应堆安全分析中展现出优于传统经验方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临界热通量（CHF）预测对核反应堆等设备的安全和效率至关重要。传统经验公式存在预测偏差，而纯机器学习方法虽有效但缺乏可解释性和物理基础。因此，研究旨在开发结合数据驱动与物理原理的混合模型以提升预测可靠性。

Method: 研究在CTF子通道代码中集成了纯数据驱动机器学习模型及两种混合模型（基于Biasi和Bowring CHF关联式），并通过Fortran框架实现。验证采用NRC CHF数据库子集和Bennett干涸实验数据。

Result: 混合模型在验证案例中误差显著低于传统经验公式，纯机器学习模型表现与之相当。趋势分析表明，基于ML的模型减少了CHF高估倾向，整体精度提升。

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的CHF模型可有效集成至子通道代码，其性能优于传统方法，为核反应堆安全分析提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the transition from nucleate to film boiling,
where heat transfer to the working fluid can rapidly deteriorate. Accurate CHF
prediction is essential for efficiency, safety, and preventing equipment
damage, particularly in nuclear reactors. Although widely used, empirical
correlations frequently exhibit discrepancies in comparison with experimental
data, limiting their reliability in diverse operational conditions. Traditional
machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated the potential for CHF
prediction but have often suffered from limited interpretability, data
scarcity, and insufficient knowledge of physical principles. Hybrid model
approaches, which combine data-driven ML with physics-based models, mitigate
these concerns by incorporating prior knowledge of the domain. This study
integrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi
and Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom
Fortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a
subset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout
experiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower
error metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure
ML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error
parity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF
overprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that
ML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can
potentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods.

Abstract: We present a propositional logic with fundamental probabilistic semantics, in
which each formula is given a real measure in the interval $[0,1]$ that
represents its degree of truth. This semantics replaces the binarity of
classical logic, while preserving its deductive structure. We demonstrate the
soundness theorem, establishing that the proposed system is sound and suitable
for reasoning under uncertainty. We discuss potential applications and avenues
for future extensions of the theory. We apply probabilistic logic to a still
refractory problem in Bayesian Networks.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alpay Algebra is introduced as a universal, category-theoretic framework that
unifies classical algebraic structures with modern needs in symbolic recursion
and explainable AI. Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each
algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and
define a transfinite evolution functor $\phi\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$.
We prove that the fixed point $\phi^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object
and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs
-- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed
folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over
standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $\phi$-iterates under regular
cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $\phi^{\infty}$ and
minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude
by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages,
categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage
Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no
external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition
positions Alpay Algebra as a bridge between foundational mathematics and
high-impact AI systems, and provides a reference for further work in category
theory, transfinite fixed-point analysis, and symbolic computation.

TL;DR: DynMo提出了一种动态负载均衡方案，显著提升了动态模型训练的效率和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的动态工作负载减少方案（如MoEs、参数剪枝等）会导致严重的负载不平衡，限制了大规模分布式训练的实用性。

Method: DynMo是一种自主动态负载均衡解决方案，通过自适应平衡工作负载、动态打包任务到更少的工作节点，并支持多GPU单节点和多节点系统。

Result: 与静态训练方法相比，DynMo在多种动态模型训练中实现了显著的加速效果，最高可达4.52倍。

Conclusion: DynMo有效解决了动态模型训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率，适用于多种动态模型和大规模分布式系统。

Abstract: To reduce computational and memory costs in Large Language Models (LLMs),
dynamic workload reduction schemes like Mixture of Experts (MoEs), parameter
pruning, layer freezing, sparse attention, early token exit, and Mixture of
Depths (MoDs) have emerged. However, these methods introduce severe workload
imbalances, limiting their practicality for large-scale distributed training.
We propose DynMo, an autonomous dynamic load balancing solution that ensures
optimal compute distribution when using pipeline parallelism in training
dynamic models. DynMo adaptively balances workloads, dynamically packs tasks
into fewer workers to free idle resources, and supports both multi-GPU
single-node and multi-node systems. Compared to static training methods
(Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed), DynMo accelerates training by up to 1.23x (MoEs),
3.18x (pruning), 2.23x (layer freezing), 4.02x (sparse attention), 4.52x (early
exit), and 1.17x (MoDs). DynMo is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高密度群体（如火蚁）如何通过局部学习缓解堵塞，并开发具有任务能力的活性物质。

Method: 使用小型机器人群体在狭窄隧道中进行颗粒挖掘实验，通过碰撞和隧道长度估计调整反转概率。

Result: 自适应反转概率减少了堵塞，提高了工作量分配不均和整体性能。

Conclusion: 简单学习规则能有效应对高密度活性物质中的堵塞问题，为生物和机器人群体研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Social organisms which construct nests consisting of tunnels and chambers
necessarily navigate confined and crowded conditions. Unlike low-density
collectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and
statistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids
is important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our
previous work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize
diverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction
reversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and
thus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small
robophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of
clogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we
can develop "task capable" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge
in part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming
collisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we
hypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely
through local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation
in a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time.
Initially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals
improved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy
tunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our
robophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming
complexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or
leverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to
hypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在共享工作空间中的协作任务增多，单个机器人故障可能严重影响整体性能，尤其在缺乏全局信息或直接通信的情况下。

Method: 引入“主动接触响应”（ACR）方法，机器人通过物理接触感知故障同伴并调整行为，主动重新定位故障机器人以减少障碍。

Result: 实验表明，ACR显著缩短了系统从故障中恢复的时间，使集体挖掘任务在性能下降最小的情况下持续进行。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用局部、社交和物理交互可有效增强多机器人系统在受限和极端环境中的容错与协调能力。

Abstract: As robots are increasingly deployed to collaborate on tasks within shared
workspaces and resources, the failure of an individual robot can critically
affect the group's performance. This issue is particularly challenging when
robots lack global information or direct communication, relying instead on
social interaction for coordination and to complete their tasks. In this study,
we propose a novel fault-tolerance technique leveraging physical contact
interactions in multi-robot systems, specifically under conditions of limited
sensing and spatial confinement. We introduce the "Active Contact Response"
(ACR) method, where each robot modulates its behavior based on the likelihood
of encountering an inoperative (faulty) robot. Active robots are capable of
collectively repositioning stationary and faulty peers to reduce obstructions
and maintain optimal group functionality. We implement our algorithm in a team
of autonomous robots, equipped with contact-sensing and collision-tolerance
capabilities, tasked with collectively excavating cohesive model pellets.
Experimental results indicate that the ACR method significantly improves the
system's recovery time from robot failures, enabling continued collective
excavation with minimal performance degradation. Thus, this work demonstrates
the potential of leveraging local, social, and physical interactions to enhance
fault tolerance and coordination in multi-robot systems operating in
constrained and extreme environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于气流惯性的里程计系统，通过多传感器数据融合（包括热风速计、IMU、ESC和气压计）来估计飞行器状态，解决了低成本传感器偏差和气流干扰的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低成本IMU和气压计存在显著偏差，且风速计测量易受螺旋桨旋转和地面效应干扰，因此需要一种可靠的方法来准确估计飞行器的速度和位置。

Method: 采用GRU深度神经网络从噪声干扰的风速计数据中估计相对风速，并结合带有偏差模型的观测器来融合传感器数据，从而估计飞行器状态。

Result: 在无风室内环境中，该方法能够解耦螺旋桨下洗气流和地面效应引起的风速干扰，准确估计飞行速度。IMU和气压计偏差得到有效估计，位置积分漂移仅为5.7米（203秒随机飞行）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多传感器融合和深度学习技术，显著提升了飞行器状态估计的准确性，适用于低成本传感器场景。

Abstract: This work demonstrates an airflow inertial based odometry system with
multi-sensor data fusion, including thermal anemometer, IMU, ESC, and
barometer. This goal is challenging because low-cost IMUs and barometers have
significant bias, and anemometer measurements are very susceptible to
interference from spinning propellers and ground effects. We employ a GRU-based
deep neural network to estimate relative air speed from noisy and disturbed
anemometer measurements, and an observer with bias model to fuse the sensor
data and thus estimate the state of aerial vehicle. A complete flight data,
including takeoff and landing on the ground, shows that the approach is able to
decouple the downwash induced wind speed caused by propellers and the ground
effect, and accurately estimate the flight speed in a wind-free indoor
environment. IMU, and barometer bias are effectively estimated, which
significantly reduces the position integration drift, which is only 5.7m for
203s manual random flight. The open source is available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类演示的机器人操作学习泛化能力不足，尤其在复杂灵巧操作任务中，数据稀缺限制了Vision-Language-Action（VLA）范式的性能。

Method: OFA方法利用灵巧操作任务中观察到的稳定末端轨迹，采用分层流程：物体感知与姿态估计、预操作姿态到达和OFA策略执行。

Result: 在七项任务的实际实验中，OFA在位置和背景泛化测试中显著优于基线方法，仅需10次演示即可实现稳健性能。

Conclusion: OFA是一种数据高效且泛化能力强的灵巧操作方法，适用于多样化场景和物体布局。

Abstract: Robot manipulation learning from human demonstrations offers a rapid means to
acquire skills but often lacks generalization across diverse scenes and object
placements. This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in
complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to
data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce
Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized
dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed
in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our
method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation,
pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures
that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and
positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks
demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both
positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust
performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的管道在内窥镜手术中脆弱且难以泛化，需要手动调整且无法融入高级意图。VLA模型通过端到端框架语义适应医生指令，但应用于机器人内窥镜时面临复杂动态解剖环境的挑战。

Method: 提出EndoVLA模型，专为胃肠道介入的连续机器人设计，结合监督微调和强化微调的双阶段策略，处理数据稀缺和领域偏移问题。

Result: EndoVLA显著提升内窥镜跟踪性能，并在多样化场景和复杂顺序任务中实现零样本泛化。

Conclusion: EndoVLA为内窥镜手术提供了一种无需手动重新校准的自主跟踪和切割解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In endoscopic procedures, autonomous tracking of abnormal regions and
following circumferential cutting markers can significantly reduce the
cognitive burden on endoscopists. However, conventional model-based pipelines
are fragile for each component (e.g., detection, motion planning) requires
manual tuning and struggles to incorporate high-level endoscopic intent,
leading to poor generalization across diverse scenes. Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models, which integrate visual perception, language grounding, and motion
planning within an end-to-end framework, offer a promising alternative by
semantically adapting to surgeon prompts without manual recalibration. Despite
their potential, applying VLA models to robotic endoscopy presents unique
challenges due to the complex and dynamic anatomical environments of the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To address this, we introduce EndoVLA, designed
specifically for continuum robots in GI interventions. Given endoscopic images
and surgeon-issued tracking prompts, EndoVLA performs three core tasks: (1)
polyp tracking, (2) delineation and following of abnormal mucosal regions, and
(3) adherence to circular markers during circumferential cutting. To tackle
data scarcity and domain shifts, we propose a dual-phase strategy comprising
supervised fine-tuning on our EndoVLA-Motion dataset and reinforcement
fine-tuning with task-aware rewards. Our approach significantly improves
tracking performance in endoscopy and enables zero-shot generalization in
diverse scenes and complex sequential tasks.

Result: QC-SAC在模拟实验中实现了接近最优的驾驶策略，显著超越现有模仿学习、强化学习和混合学习方法。

Conclusion: QC-SAC首次实现了带避障的安全自动驾驶过度转向控制，具有重要实际意义。

Abstract: Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce
unintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to
control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent
autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through
stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or
assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This
paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that
tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E
techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and
Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or
extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide
perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders
accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic
(QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal
demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we
introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle
encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly
placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal
driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL
baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer
control with obstacle avoidance.

Conclusion: 元认知学习可以促进机器人规划中的创造力，为LLM在机器人领域的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various
domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static,
prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks
under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning
and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a
fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive
capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to
perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an
early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered
multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered
robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that
identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task
scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show
that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly
outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is
capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still
successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis
that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, yet their
struggle with hallucinations, inefficient reasoning, and limited real-world

overcome this, we introduce \textbf{AgentThink}, a pioneering unified framework
that, for the first time, integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with

core innovations include: \textbf{(i) Structured Data Generation}, by
establishing an autonomous driving tool library to automatically construct
structured, self-verified reasoning data explicitly incorporating tool usage
for diverse driving scenarios; \textbf{(ii) A Two-stage Training Pipeline},
employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization

\textbf{(iii) Agent-style Tool-Usage Evaluation}, introducing a novel
multi-tool assessment protocol to rigorously evaluate the model's tool
invocation and utilization. Experiments on the DriveLMM-o1 benchmark
demonstrate AgentThink significantly boosts overall reasoning scores by
\textbf{53.91\%} and enhances answer accuracy by \textbf{33.54\%}, while
markedly improving reasoning quality and consistency. Furthermore, ablation

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can

Abstract: Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot
demonstrations can be used to train transformer-based models that have the
potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating,
distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically
consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from
multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient
open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and
learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a
self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can
significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and
data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE
datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x
(lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video
decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework
that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when
decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with
lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer.
Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer
reduction in downstream task accuracy.

Abstract: Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental
challenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While
prior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context
of manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized
benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning
cross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and
push-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test
generalization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a
robot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on
a robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on
combinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of
different RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to
novel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can
outperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to

Motivation: 现实机器人需在复杂环境中感知并规划无碰撞路径，但现有生成模型难以处理全局运动规划中的细微约束违反问题。

Method: 采用级联分层模型结合扩散策略，统一全局预测与局部优化，并引入在线轨迹修复机制。

Result: 在导航和操作任务中，该方法比多种基线模型性能提升约5%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了全局运动规划中的复杂约束问题，为机器人动态环境适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robots in the real world need to perceive and move to goals in complex
environments without collisions. Avoiding collisions is especially difficult
when relying on sensor perception and when goals are among clutter. Diffusion
policies and other generative models have shown strong performance in solving
local planning problems, but often struggle at avoiding all of the subtle
constraint violations that characterize truly challenging global motion
planning problems. In this work, we propose an approach for learning global
motion planning using diffusion policies, allowing the robot to generate full
trajectories through complex scenes and reasoning about multiple obstacles
along the path. Our approach uses cascaded hierarchical models which unify
global prediction and local refinement together with online plan repair to
ensure the trajectories are collision free. Our method outperforms (by ~5%) a
wide variety of baselines on challenging tasks in multiple domains including
navigation and manipulation.

TL;DR: CBTL方法通过利用约束满足问题的零空间实现机器人行为的个性化，兼顾安全性与能力，并在多种环境中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人需在长期使用中满足不同用户的多样化需求和偏好，如何在保证安全和能力的前提下实现灵活个性化是研究动机。

Method: 提出CBTL方法，首先生成确保安全和能力的约束满足问题，然后通过在线交互学习参数化约束，逐步实现行为个性化。

Result: 在三种模拟环境、网络用户研究和真实机器人辅助喂食系统中的评估表明，CBTL比基线方法更有效且交互次数更少。

Conclusion: CBTL为持续、灵活、主动且安全的机器人个性化提供了一种统一且实用的方法。

Abstract: Generalist robots must personalize in-the-wild to meet the diverse needs and
preferences of long-term users. How can we enable flexible personalization
without sacrificing safety or competency? This paper proposes Coloring Between
the Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins
with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then
incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from
online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the
compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient
adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse
simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot
assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective
personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate
that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible,
active, and safe robot personalization. Website:

Motivation: 当前机器人策略学习在长期推理和泛化能力方面存在不足，FLARE旨在通过潜在世界建模提升策略学习的性能和泛化能力。

Method: FLARE通过将扩散变换器的特征与未来观测的潜在嵌入对齐，仅需少量架构修改（如添加少量token到标准VLA模型），即可实现长期推理。

Result: FLARE在两个多任务模拟模仿学习基准测试中表现优异，性能提升高达26%，并能通过无动作标签的人类视频演示提升对新物体的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{F}$uture $\textbf{LA}$tent $\textbf{RE}$presentation
Alignment ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel framework that integrates predictive
latent world modeling into robot policy learning. By aligning features from a
diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future observations,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent
representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term
consequences while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, $\textbf{FLARE}$
requires only minimal architectural modifications -- adding a few tokens to
standard vision-language-action (VLA) models -- yet delivers substantial
performance gains. Across two challenging multitask simulation imitation
learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid tabletop manipulation,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, $\textbf{FLARE}$ unlocks the
ability to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations without action
labels, significantly boosting policy generalization to a novel object with
unseen geometry with as few as a single robot demonstration. Our results
establish $\textbf{FLARE}$ as a general and scalable approach for combining
implicit world modeling with high-frequency robotic control.

TL;DR: 提出RD-Agent(Q)框架，通过多智能体协同优化因子与模型，实现量化策略全栈自动化研发，显著提升收益与稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场的复杂性导致传统量化研究流程自动化不足、可解释性弱且各环节割裂，需一种整合因子挖掘与模型创新的协同优化方案。

Method: 将量化流程分解为研究阶段（动态设定目标、生成假设）和开发阶段（代码生成与实盘回测），通过反馈循环与多臂老虎机调度器迭代优化。

Result: 实证显示RD-Agent(Q)年化收益达传统因子库的2倍，因子用量减少70%，且优于前沿深度时序模型，实现预测精度与策略稳健性的平衡。

Conclusion: RD-Agent(Q)为量化金融提供首个数据驱动的全栈自动化框架，其因子-模型联合优化范式具有显著性能优势。

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due
to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility.
Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current
quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak
interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as
factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for
Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent
framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of
quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.
RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research
stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based
on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that
employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code,
which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected
through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and
informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive
direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher
annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and
outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint
factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy
and strategy robustness. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癫痫EEG检测方法难以泛化到新患者，因个体间EEG模式差异显著。

Method: CNN通过对抗训练提取患者不变特征，BiLSTM建模时序依赖关系。

Result: 在20名局灶性癫痫患者数据上表现优于非对抗方法，跨患者检测准确率高。

Conclusion: 对抗训练与时序建模结合可实现鲁棒的跨患者癫痫发作检测。

Abstract: Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains
challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across
patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific
approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address
this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training
with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term
memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features
through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy
while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures
temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution
patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy
demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high
detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial
training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.

Motivation: 表面肌电信号（EMG）可用于控制辅助设备，但全面收集所有目标动作（尤其是复杂组合动作）的训练数据具有挑战性。

Method: 通过基础动作模式的凸组合生成合成肌电数据，仅需测量基础动作数据即可训练模型识别组合动作。

Result: 在8名受试者的上肢动作分类实验中，该方法对未见过组合动作的分类准确率提升约17%。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法显著扩展了可识别动作范围，同时大幅降低实际数据采集工作量。

Abstract: Electromyogram (EMG) signals recorded from the skin surface enable intuitive
control of assistive devices such as prosthetic limbs. However, in EMG-based
motion recognition, collecting comprehensive training data for all target
motions remains challenging, particularly for complex combined motions. This
paper proposes a method to efficiently recognize combined motions using
synthetic EMG data generated through convex combinations of basic motion
patterns. Instead of measuring all possible combined motions, the proposed
method utilizes measured basic motion data along with synthetically combined
motion data for training. This approach expands the range of recognizable
combined motions while minimizing the required training data collection. We
evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method through an upper limb motion
classification experiment with eight subjects. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy for
unseen combined motions by approximately 17%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统肌电信号运动识别需针对每个被试收集大量标注数据，过程耗时且繁琐。利用多源被试的预训练信息可能减轻目标被试的数据负担。

Method: 基于‘肌电特征均值差异大但方差模式相似’的假设，设计贝叶斯框架迁移多源被试的方差信息至目标被试，并引入系数调节迁移信息量。

Result: 在两个肌电数据集上的实验表明，该方差迁移策略优于现有方法，能用有限目标数据实现高精度分类。

Conclusion: 方差迁移学习有效解决了跨被试肌电信号分类的数据效率问题，为减少个体校准需求提供了新思路。

Abstract: In electromyogram (EMG)-based motion recognition, a subject-specific
classifier is typically trained with sufficient labeled data. However, this
process demands extensive data collection over extended periods, burdening the
subject. To address this, utilizing information from pre-training on multiple
subjects for the training of the target subject could be beneficial. This paper
proposes an inter-subject variance transfer learning method based on a Bayesian
approach. This method is founded on the simple hypothesis that while the means
of EMG features vary greatly across subjects, their variances may exhibit
similar patterns. Our approach transfers variance information, acquired through
pre-training on multiple source subjects, to a target subject within a Bayesian
updating framework, thereby allowing accurate classification using limited
target calibration data. A coefficient was also introduced to adjust the amount
of information transferred for efficient transfer learning. Experimental
evaluations using two EMG datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our
variance transfer strategy and its superiority compared to existing methods.

Result: 该算法实现了8ln m的近似比，显著简化了现有方法并降低了常数因子。

Conclusion: 该算法为ODT问题提供了一种高效且易于实现的解决方案，适用于广泛的场景。

Abstract: Optimal decision tree (\odt) is a fundamental problem arising in applications
such as active learning, entity identification, and medical diagnosis. An
instance of \odt is given by $m$ hypotheses, out of which an unknown ``true''
hypothesis is drawn according to some probability distribution. An algorithm
needs to identify the true hypothesis by making queries: each query incurs a
cost and has a known response for each hypothesis. The goal is to minimize the
expected query cost to identify the true hypothesis. We consider the most
general setting with arbitrary costs, probabilities and responses. \odt is
NP-hard to approximate better than $\ln m$ and there are $O(\ln m)$
approximation algorithms known for it. However, these algorithms and/or their
analyses are quite complex. Moreover, the leading constant factors are large.
We provide a simple algorithm and analysis for \odt, proving an approximation
ratio of $8 \ln m$.

TL;DR: QUADS是一个统一框架，通过多阶段训练优化SLU系统的性能和效率，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度和模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SLU系统在资源受限环境中单独应用蒸馏和量化方法，导致压缩效果不佳，因为蒸馏忽略了量化约束。

Method: 提出QUADS框架，通过多阶段训练结合预调优模型，统一优化蒸馏和量化，增强对低比特环境的适应性。

Result: QUADS在SLURP和FSC数据集上分别达到71.13%和99.20%的准确率，计算复杂度降低60-73倍，模型大小缩小83-700倍。

Conclusion: QUADS为资源受限的SLU应用提供了高效解决方案，在极端量化条件下表现出强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) systems must balance performance and
efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing methods
apply distillation and quantization separately, leading to suboptimal
compression as distillation ignores quantization constraints. We propose QUADS,
a unified framework that optimizes both through multi-stage training with a
pre-tuned model, enhancing adaptability to low-bit regimes while maintaining
accuracy. QUADS achieves 71.13\% accuracy on SLURP and 99.20\% on FSC, with
only minor degradations of up to 5.56\% compared to state-of-the-art models.
Additionally, it reduces computational complexity by 60--73$\times$ (GMACs) and
model size by 83--700$\times$, demonstrating strong robustness under extreme
quantization. These results establish QUADS as a highly efficient solution for
real-world, resource-constrained SLU applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌声合成模型过度依赖音素和音符边界标注，在零样本场景下鲁棒性不足且音素转换生硬，同时缺乏有效的多级风格控制。

Method: 1) 模糊边界内容编码器预测时长并平滑过渡；2) 定制音频编码器通过对比学习对齐歌声、语音和文本提示；3) 基于流的定制Transformer利用Cus-MOE增强合成质量和风格建模。

Result: 实验表明，TCSinger 2在主观和客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TCSinger 2通过多模块设计解决了零样本歌声合成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的跨语言风格化合成。

Abstract: Customizable multilingual zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) has various
potential applications in music composition and short video dubbing. However,
existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations,
limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions
between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level
style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer
and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three
key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration,
extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable
smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to
extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3)
Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision,
enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated
singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline
models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

TL;DR: 提出分段变体码本（SVCs）方法，通过在不同语言单元上量化语音，有效保留韵律和副语言信息，同时保持比特率效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL语音模型（如HuBERT）的量化方法在压缩和性能提升方面表现良好，但会丢失韵律和副语言信息（如情感、强调）。单纯增加码本大小虽能缓解信息丢失，但会导致比特率上升效率低下。

Method: 提出分段变体码本（SVCs），在不同语言单元（帧、音素、单词、语句）上分别量化语音，将其分解为多个分段特定的离散特征流。实验表明，在离散化之前进行池化能更好地保留分段级信息。

Result: SVCs在多项探测任务中显著更有效地保留了韵律和副语言信息。重合成实验进一步证实了风格实现的改进和质量的轻微提升，同时保持了可懂度。

Conclusion: SVCs方法在保留语音关键信息的同时，兼顾了比特率效率，为语音量化提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization in SSL speech models (e.g., HuBERT) improves compression and
performance in tasks like language modeling, resynthesis, and text-to-speech
but often discards prosodic and paralinguistic information (e.g., emotion,
prominence). While increasing codebook size mitigates some loss, it
inefficiently raises bitrates. We propose Segmentation-Variant Codebooks
(SVCs), which quantize speech at distinct linguistic units (frame, phone, word,
utterance), factorizing it into multiple streams of segment-specific discrete
features. Our results show that SVCs are significantly more effective at
preserving prosodic and paralinguistic information across probing tasks.
Additionally, we find that pooling before rather than after discretization
better retains segment-level information. Resynthesis experiments further
confirm improved style realization and slightly improved quality while
preserving intelligibility.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on toxic speech detection in text, a critical gap
remains in handling spoken Mandarin audio. The lack of annotated datasets that
capture the unique prosodic cues and culturally specific expressions in
Mandarin leaves spoken toxicity underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ToxicTone -- the largest public dataset of its kind -- featuring detailed
annotations that distinguish both forms of toxicity (e.g., profanity, bullying)
and sources of toxicity (e.g., anger, sarcasm, dismissiveness). Our data,
sourced from diverse real-world audio and organized into 13 topical categories,
mirrors authentic communication scenarios. We also propose a multimodal
detection framework that integrates acoustic, linguistic, and emotional
features using state-of-the-art speech and emotion encoders. Extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms text-only and baseline models,
underscoring the essential role of speech-specific cues in revealing hidden
toxic expressions.

Motivation: 软件日志在系统维护和操作中至关重要，但由于包含敏感信息，公开可用的日志数据集有限，阻碍了日志分析研究的发展。

Method: 提出了SDLog，一种基于深度学习的框架，用于自动识别和替换日志中的敏感信息，减少人工干预并提高泛化能力。

Result: SDLog在仅需100个微调样本的情况下，能正确识别99.5%的敏感属性，F1分数达到98.4%，显著优于传统正则表达式方法。

Conclusion: SDLog是首个在软件日志匿名化中替代正则表达式的深度学习方法，有效解决了敏感信息识别的问题。

Abstract: Software logs are messages recorded during the execution of a software system
that provide crucial run-time information about events and activities. Although
software logs have a critical role in software maintenance and operation tasks,
publicly accessible log datasets remain limited, hindering advance in log
analysis research and practices. The presence of sensitive information,
particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers,
introduces serious privacy and re-identification risks, discouraging the
publishing and sharing of real-world logs. In practice, log anonymization
techniques primarily rely on regular expression patterns, which involve
manually crafting rules to identify and replace sensitive information. However,
these regex-based approaches suffer from significant limitations, such as
extensive manual efforts and poor generalizability across diverse log formats
and datasets. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SDLog, a deep
learning-based framework designed to identify sensitive information in software
logs. Our results show that SDLog overcomes regex limitations and outperforms
the best-performing regex patterns in identifying sensitive information. With
only 100 fine-tuning samples from the target dataset, SDLog can correctly
identify 99.5% of sensitive attributes and achieves an F1-score of 98.4%. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning alternative to
regex-based methods in software log anonymization.

Conclusion: 论文强调识别代码混杂因子的重要性，为NCMs的因果可解释性提供实用指南，推动软件工程中更可信的AI应用。

Abstract: This dissertation addresses achieving causal interpretability in Deep
Learning for Software Engineering (DL4SE). While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show
strong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in
causal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of
their capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must
explain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies
correlations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change
analysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc
interpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide
programming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a
four-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models
(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like
Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is
extensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding
explanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code
generation across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning
architectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to
code syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts
while minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化测试用例生成方法难以满足复杂规范或生成有效的边界用例，限制了其在竞争编程中对算法鲁棒性评估的实用性。

Method: 利用微调的CodeT5模型将自然语言输入规范转换为CCFGs，从而系统化生成高质量测试用例。

Result: 在CodeContests数据集上的实验表明，基于CCFGs的测试用例在识别错误算法方面优于基线方法，有效性和正确性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为竞争编程的自动化评估提供了一个可扩展且可靠的语法驱动框架。

Abstract: Automated Test Case Generation (ATCG) is crucial for evaluating software
reliability, particularly in competitive programming where robust algorithm
assessments depend on diverse and accurate test cases. However, existing ATCG
methods often fail to meet complex specifications or generate effective corner
cases, limiting their utility. In this work, we introduce Context-Free Grammars
with Counters (CCFGs), a formalism that captures both syntactic and semantic
structures in input specifications. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 model, we
translate natural language input specifications into CCFGs, enabling the
systematic generation of high-quality test cases. Experiments on the
CodeContests dataset demonstrate that CCFG-based test cases outperform baseline
methods in identifying incorrect algorithms, achieving significant gains in
validity and effectiveness. Our approach provides a scalable and reliable
grammar-driven framework for enhancing automated competitive programming
evaluations.

Abstract: Command injection vulnerabilities are a significant security threat in
dynamic languages like Python, particularly in widely used open-source projects
where security issues can have extensive impact. With the proven effectiveness
of Large Language Models(LLMs) in code-related tasks, such as testing,
researchers have explored their potential for vulnerabilities analysis. This
study evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4,
as an alternative approach for automated testing for vulnerability detection.
In particular, LLMs have demonstrated advanced contextual understanding and
adaptability, making them promising candidates for identifying nuanced security
vulnerabilities within code. To evaluate this potential, we applied LLM-based
analysis to six high-profile GitHub projects-Django, Flask, TensorFlow,
Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Langchain-each with over 50,000 stars and extensive
adoption across software development and academic research. Our analysis
assesses both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in detecting command
injection vulnerabilities, evaluating factors such as detection accuracy,
efficiency, and practical integration into development workflows. In addition,
we provide a comparative analysis of different LLM tools to identify those most
suitable for security applications. Our findings offer guidance for developers
and security researchers on leveraging LLMs as innovative and automated
approaches to enhance software security.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究比较了BERT和GPT-4o-mini在软件工程情感分析中的表现，发现GPT-4o-mini在复杂数据集上表现更优，但需根据数据集特性选择模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件工程情感分析工具未能充分考虑领域内语言的细微差别和上下文依赖性，因此需要评估双向变换器和生成预训练变换器在该领域的性能差异。

Method: 使用GitHub、Stack Overflow和Jira的数据集，对BERT和GPT-4o-mini进行微调和默认配置的基准测试。

Result: 在GitHub和Jira等结构化数据集上，微调后的GPT-4o-mini表现与BERT相当；在Stack Overflow等复杂数据集上，默认GPT-4o-mini模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明，选择适合数据集特性的模型架构对优化性能至关重要，并为未来软件工程领域情感分析工具的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding developer
interactions, issue resolutions, and project dynamics within software
engineering (SE). While traditional SE-specific sentiment analysis tools have
made significant strides, they often fail to account for the nuanced and
context-dependent language inherent to the domain. This study systematically
evaluates the performance of bidirectional transformers, such as BERT, against
generative pre-trained transformers, specifically GPT-4o-mini, in SE sentiment
analysis. Using datasets from GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Jira, we benchmark
the models' capabilities with fine-tuned and default configurations. The
results reveal that fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini performs comparable to BERT and
other bidirectional models on structured and balanced datasets like GitHub and
Jira, achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.98, respectively.
However, on linguistically complex datasets with imbalanced sentiment
distributions, such as Stack Overflow, the default GPT-4o-mini model exhibits
superior generalization, achieving an accuracy of 85.3\% compared to the
fine-tuned model's 13.1\%. These findings highlight the trade-offs between
fine-tuning and leveraging pre-trained models for SE tasks. The study
underscores the importance of aligning model architectures with dataset
characteristics to optimize performance and proposes directions for future
research in refining sentiment analysis tools tailored to the SE domain.

TL;DR: 研究评估了五种先进代码模型在多语言代码注释生成中的表现，发现现有神经指标难以可靠区分正确与错误注释，并公开了包含12,500条标注数据的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的训练以英语为中心，研究旨在评估代码模型在非英语环境中的表现，揭示其在多语言工作流中的挑战。

Method: 采用开放式编码研究，分析五种代码模型（CodeGemma等）在五种自然语言（中文、荷兰语等）生成的代码注释错误，构建含26类错误的分类法。

Result: 模型常生成部分正确注释，但现有指标无法有效区分质量；专家评分显示正确与错误注释的分数存在显著重叠，指标可信度存疑。

Conclusion: 多语言代码注释生成存在显著语言差异，需开发更可靠的评估指标以提升模型实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models are essential coding assistants, yet their training is
predominantly English-centric. In this study, we evaluate the performance of
code language models in non-English contexts, identifying challenges in their
adoption and integration into multilingual workflows. We conduct an open-coding
study to analyze errors in code comments generated by five state-of-the-art
code models, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, GraniteCode, and StarCoder2
across five natural languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, Greek, and Polish. Our
study yields a dataset of 12,500 labeled generations, which we publicly
release. We then assess the reliability of standard metrics in capturing
comment \textit{correctness} across languages and evaluate their
trustworthiness as judgment criteria. Through our open-coding investigation, we
identified a taxonomy of 26 distinct error categories in model-generated code
comments. They highlight variations in language cohesion, informativeness, and
syntax adherence across different natural languages. Our analysis shows that,
while these models frequently produce partially correct comments, modern neural
metrics fail to reliably differentiate meaningful completions from random
noise. Notably, the significant score overlap between expert-rated correct and
incorrect comments calls into question the effectiveness of these metrics in
assessing generated comments.

TL;DR: LeanCode通过基于上下文注意力分数选择性移除代码标记，显著提升代码搜索和摘要任务的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理代码时计算复杂度高，尤其随输入序列增长而显著增加，亟需简化方法以降低训练和预测时间。

Method: 利用注意力分数评估标记重要性，分类任务采用编码器中`CLS`标记的注意力分数，序列到序列任务则用编码器-解码器注意力分数。

Result: 在代码搜索任务上分别超越DietCode和Slimcode 60%和16%，代码摘要任务上提升29%和27%。

Conclusion: LeanCode通过上下文感知的标记剪枝策略，有效提升代码处理效率，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational
complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code
sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and
prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to
represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of
tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average
scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens
within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also
employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance
for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.Our evaluation shows
LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements
of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization,
respectively.
