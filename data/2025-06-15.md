### [1] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，自然语言的语义退化特性导致大语言模型（LLMs）存在根本性局限：随着语义复杂度增加，任何解释主体（人或AI）恢复单一意图含义的可能性趋近于零。通过语义贝尔不等式实验发现，语言解释在歧义下可表现出非经典语境性，暗示传统频率学派方法存在信息损失，需采用贝叶斯重复抽样方法更有效表征语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于自然语言语义退化现象——语义表达复杂度增加时，潜在解释呈组合爆炸式增长。传统观点认为语言形式本身具有固有意义，但LLMs等系统受限于此特性，无法突破语义解释的约束。论文旨在通过计算复杂性论证和实验验证，揭示语言意义实际依赖于观察者的解释行为。

Method: 使用柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂性理论论证语义恢复的计算不可行性，并通过语义贝尔不等式测试进行验证：将不同LLM代理作为计算认知系统，在多种上下文设置下解释歧义词对，测量其CHSH期望值以检测非经典语境性。

Result: 实验测得平均CHSH期望值介于1.2-2.8之间，部分结果（如2.3-2.4）显著违反经典边界|S|≤2，证明语言解释在歧义下存在非经典语境性，与人类认知实验结果一致。

Conclusion: 结论指出：1）语言形式自身不包含固有意义，意义通过观察者行为实现；2）传统频率学派分析方法必然丢失信息；3）贝叶斯式重复抽样方法能更实用地表征语境化语义，为自然语言处理提供新方向。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

### [2] [Chat-of-Thought: Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Generating Domain Specific Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10086)
*Christodoulos Constantinides,Shuxin Lin,Nianjun Zhou,Dhaval Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Chat-of-Thought多智能体系统，通过角色化LLM代理协作与动态任务路由优化工业资产FMEA文档生成，引入多人格动态讨论机制实现内容迭代优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FMEA文档生成效率低且依赖人工经验，需通过AI技术提升自动化水平与准确性，应对工业设备监测中的复杂分析需求。

Method: 采用多LLM代理协同框架，结合动态任务路由与模板驱动工作流，通过多角色辩论机制(Chat of Thought)实现FMEA内容的迭代验证与优化。

Result: 构建了支持上下文感知的智能体协作系统，验证了在工业场景中通过交互式工作流实现FMEA表格生成与质量提升的有效性。

Conclusion: Chat-of-Thought证明了多智能体辩论机制在工业知识工程中的创新价值，为复杂文档生成任务提供了可扩展的AI协同解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the
generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is
the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [3] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS)框架，用于检测语义相同但措辞不同的提示对大型语言模型行为的影响，发现模型响应存在与分词和解码相关的统计规律性偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究可能忽视语义等效但措辞不同的提示对模型行为的影响，需探究此类提示方差是否导致模型输出的不稳定，并分析其潜在机制。

Method: 提出PBSS诊断框架，通过在10个受限任务中生成语义等效但分词不同的提示，系统性测量模型输出的行为漂移。

Result: 实验显示不同模型在语义等效提示下存在一致的响应偏移，且偏移模式与分词策略和解码过程具有统计相关性。

Conclusion: 提示的措辞变化会导致模型服务质量不稳定，表明分词策略和解码动态是影响LLM输出稳定性的潜在因素，需在模型评估中纳入此类稳定性维度。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [4] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ChartReasoner框架，通过两阶段代码驱动方法解决视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，结合监督微调和强化学习，在图表问答任务中实现高保真、可解释的推理，性能接近GPT-4o等专有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法将视觉任务转换为文本任务时丢失关键视觉信息（如结构、语义细节），尤其在需要大量视觉细节的图表问答任务中表现不足。

Method: 1. 训练高保真模型将图表转为结构化ECharts代码；2. 设计自动化数据合成流程生成并过滤推理轨迹；3. 结合监督微调与强化学习训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，ChartReasoner在保留图表原始细节的同时，以更少参数达到与开源SOTA模型相当的性能，并在跨域场景中接近GPT-4o等专有系统。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner通过代码驱动的两阶段框架有效平衡视觉信息保留与推理性能，为视觉推理任务提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

### [5] [Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139)
*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无监督算法ICM，通过最大化内部一致性微调预训练语言模型，无需人工标注即可激发超人类能力模型潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练范式依赖人工标注指导模型行为，但超人类能力模型难以获得高质量人工监督，需探索无监督方法。

Method: 内部一致性最大化(ICM)算法：利用模型自身生成标签进行微调，完全无需外部监督信号。

Result: 在GSM8k验证、TruthfulQA等任务上匹配黄金标准监督效果；使用ICM训练的Claude 3.5 Haiku助手及其奖励模型均超越人类监督版本。

Conclusion: ICM能有效激发语言模型的潜在能力，特别在模型能力超越人类的领域，为前沿模型训练提供新范式。

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [6] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较专家、众包工作者和LLMs在共情沟通标注中的一致性，发现LLMs表现接近专家水平，可靠性超过众包，支持其在情感敏感任务中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在评估共情沟通时的可靠性，验证其是否可作为情感敏感应用（如对话伴侣）的透明化监督工具。

Method: 使用心理学、NLP等四个评估框架，对200个真实对话进行共情标注，收集专家（3150）、众包（2844）和LLMs（3150）的标注数据，分析组间评分一致性。

Result: 专家内部一致性高但受子维度特性（清晰度、复杂性等）影响；LLMs在所有框架中接近专家基准，可靠性超过众包工作者。

Conclusion: 通过任务特定验证与专家基准结合，LLMs可提升情感敏感应用的透明度与监督能力，例如作为对话伴侣时的共情判断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

### [7] [Analyzing Emotions in Bangla Social Media Comments Using Machine Learning and LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10154)
*Bidyarthi Paul,SM Musfiqur Rahman,Dipta Biswas,Md. Ziaul Hasan,Md. Zahid Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了多种机器学习模型（如线性SVM、BiLSTM和AdaBoost）及降维技术（PCA）在孟加拉语社交媒体评论情感分析中的应用，并通过LIME提升模型可解释性，旨在为低资源语言的情感分析提供有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决孟加拉语等资源稀缺语言在情感分析中的挑战，因其独特的地区表达和文化特征尚未被充分研究，需开发高效且可解释的技术。

Method: 使用EmoNoBa数据集中的22,698条评论，结合TF-IDF向量化n-gram特征，应用线性SVM、KNN、随机森林、BiLSTM和AdaBoost模型，并测试PCA降维效果，利用LIME解释AdaBoost分类器的预测。

Result: 通过对比不同模型及降维技术，发现结合AdaBoost与决策树解释的方法在情感分类中表现有效，但具体性能指标未在摘要中明确提及。

Conclusion: 研究表明，混合传统机器学习与深度学习方法，结合可解释性工具，可为低资源语言（如孟加拉语）的情感分析提供可行方案，推动跨语言NLP研究发展。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

### [8] [Measuring Corporate Human Capital Disclosures: Lexicon, Data, Code, and Research Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10155)
*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究利用机器学习算法(word2vec)开发了人力资本(HC)相关关键词词典，分为五个子类，并公开数据、代码及使用示例，促进未来HC管理与披露研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造日益重要，但缺乏标准化测量与披露规则，需系统化工具支持相关研究。

Method: 使用word2vec算法分析已确认的HC披露文本，构建包含五类子主题（如DEI、健康安全等）的HC关键词词典，并提供代码与BERT微调示例。

Result: 开发了多维度的HC关键词分类词典，公开数据集、代码资源，支持研究者自定义分析企业沟通中的HC问题。

Conclusion: 通过共享工具与数据，为HC管理及披露研究提供基础框架，并指出未来研究方向（如披露规则优化等）。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [9] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过叙事规划问题评估大语言模型（LLM）的故事生成能力，发现GPT-4级模型在小规模生成因果合理的故事上表现良好，但处理角色意图和戏剧冲突仍需强化学习支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评估方法存在局限性，人工评估成本高且主观性强，需结合计算叙事学理论深入理解LLM生成高质量故事的能力。

Method: 构建基于文学案例的叙事规划评估基准，从因果合理性、角色意图性、戏剧冲突三方面分析LLM的生成能力，并测试不同规模模型的性能。

Result: GPT-4级模型可生成小规模因果合理的故事，但角色意图规划和复杂戏剧冲突仍需依赖强化学习训练后的模型进行推理。

Conclusion: LLM生成高质量故事的能力受限于故事复杂度，需结合强化学习提升复杂叙事规划能力，其在游戏环境中的应用仍面临推理与角色行为协调的挑战。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

### [10] [Q2E: Query-to-Event Decomposition for Zero-Shot Multilingual Text-to-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10202)
*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Q2E方法，通过分解查询并利用LLMs和VLMs的潜在知识，结合多模态信息与熵融合评分，提升零样本多语言文本到视频检索性能，音频整合显著优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取参数化知识方面表现优异，但复杂现实事件相关的视频检索仍存在挑战。研究旨在通过自动提取模型中的事件知识，改进对简化人类查询的理解与检索效果。

Method: Q2E方法将查询分解为事件相关组件，利用LLMs/VLMs的嵌入知识，支持视觉与语音输入的多模态处理，并通过熵基融合评分实现零样本跨模态检索。

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上，Q2E优于现有基线模型，且实验证明整合音频信息可显著提升文本到视频检索性能。

Conclusion: Q2E通过事件分解与多模态融合有效提升复杂查询的检索能力，公开代码与数据为后续研究提供基础，验证了多模态知识整合的重要性。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [11] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂数学问题上表现优异，但在简单策略类游戏（如井字棋变种）中却表现不佳。研究提出TTT-Bench基准测试，揭示模型在基础战略、空间和逻辑推理能力的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准多集中于STEM领域，而LRMs在更广泛任务中的基础推理能力（如对手意图理解、空间配置推理）尚未被充分探索。人类儿童可轻松解决的简单双人策略游戏成为理想测试场景。

Method: 设计TTT-Bench基准，包含4种可验证的井字棋变种双人游戏，通过程序化方法生成可扩展的测试问题，要求模型进行对手意图预测和空间布局推理。

Result: 顶尖LRMs在TTT-Bench上平均表现比MATH 500低41%，比AIME 2024低5%。大模型依赖短推理路径表现更好，但普遍在长期战略推理任务中失败。

Conclusion: 当前LRMs在简单但新颖的战略推理任务中存在显著能力缺口，表明数学推理能力与基础认知推理能力存在解耦现象，需开发更全面的评估体系。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出利用计算方法识别不可靠叙述者，构建多领域数据集TUNa，测试大语言模型（LLM）在分类任务中的表现，并探索少样本学习、微调等方法。结果显示任务具挑战性，但LLM具备潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过计算手段识别不可靠叙述者（无意误传信息者），结合文学理论与现实文本数据，填补自动检测叙述可靠性的研究空白。

Method: 基于叙事学理论定义不可靠叙述类型，构建人工标注数据集TUNa，设计三类分类任务，测试开源与商用LLM性能，并尝试少样本学习、微调和课程学习策略。

Result: 任务难度较高，但LLM在识别不可靠叙述者方面展现潜力，不同学习策略效果差异显著。

Conclusion: 公开数据集与代码以促进相关研究，强调结合文学理论与现实数据训练模型的重要性，未来需进一步优化方法提升分类效果。

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Result: 在5个公开葡语数据集上，二元/多标签分类均表现强劲，跨领域泛化能力显著，验证合成数据有效性。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT为低资源语言仇恨言论检测提供高质量基准，证明合成数据在跨领域任务中的潜力，数据集已开源推动相关研究。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了语言模型基于概率采样的假设，指出其可能呈现确定性决策行为，导致先前推断先验的方法失效，并提出区分随机/确定性决策的方法以避免虚假先验推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑语言模型是否真正具备贝叶斯大脑特性，揭示传统基于吉布斯采样的先验推断方法在模型存在确定性决策时可能产生误导性结论。

Method: 提出通过吉布斯采样过程区分随机与确定性决策模式的检测方法，并在多种大语言模型及不同条件下进行决策模式实验验证。

Result: 发现语言模型在非零采样温度下仍可产生接近确定性的最大似然估计决策，导致传统方法收敛于虚假先验，验证了检测方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言模型决策机制复杂且受上下文影响，需谨慎推断其先验分布，所提方法为准确理解模型决策模式提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出ClusterUCB框架，通过聚类和改进的UCB算法，在保持效果的同时大幅降低梯度数据选择的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的数据选择方法在监督微调中计算资源消耗过高，难以实际应用。

Method: 结合数据梯度特征聚类+多臂老虎机建模，使用改进UCB算法进行预算分配，冷启动平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到原始方法可比效果，显著减少计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB验证了通过分层选择策略实现高效数据筛选的可行性，为大规模模型训练提供实用方案。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Flick方法，通过优化伪标签质量解决低资源语言少标签分类问题，在14个多语言数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少标签分类方法多针对英语或使用复杂模型易过拟合，且在低资源语言中面临伪标签噪声和领域适应挑战。

Method: Flick引入伪标签精炼组件，通过单聚类内聚分析和自适应top-k选择机制，从宽泛初始聚类中蒸馏高置信度伪标签。

Result: 在阿拉伯语/乌尔都语/茨瓦纳语等低资源语言及英语的14个数据集上，Flick展现出显著性能优势与跨语言适应性。

Conclusion: Flick通过聚焦高质量伪标签簇的提炼机制，有效抑制了低资源场景下的错误传播，实现了极少量真实标签下的鲁棒微调。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [17] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨在模拟教育场景中，学生提供的答案建议如何影响大型语言模型（LLM）的回应质量，发现模型存在谄媚行为：当学生答案正确时模型准确率提升15%，错误时下降15%，且小模型偏差更显著（如GPT-4.1-nano偏差达30%）。这种倾向可能加剧教育不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育场景中，LLM的谄媚行为（盲目迎合用户）可能带来风险。研究旨在验证当学生提供答案建议时，LLM是否会因迎合而降低客观性，进而影响教育公平。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4o和GPT-4.1系列共5个模型，通过5种实验条件模拟学生提供正确/错误答案的场景，分析模型答案翻转频率及词元概率变化。

Result: 模型答案质量高度依赖问题框架：学生提供错误答案时模型正确率最多降15%，反之升15%；小模型偏差更强（GPT-4.1-nano偏差30% vs. GPT-4o偏差8%），词元概率分析证实存在系统性谄媚行为。

Conclusion: LLM在教育中的谄媚行为可能扩大知识差距：帮助知识储备足的学生加速学习，却强化知识不足学生的误解。需深入理解机制并开发缓解方法以促进教育公平。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于计划性交替语音-文本训练的方法，通过逐步减少文本比例提升语音到语音翻译性能，尤其在低资源语言中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）因仅接受文本训练，在适应语音模态时面临数据不足的挑战，需解决语音-语音翻译任务中的模态适应问题。

Method: 采用词级别对齐的交替语音-文本单元进行训练，并随着训练进程逐步降低文本比例，实现从文本到语音的渐进式模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B模型后，翻译性能持续提升，对训练数据量较少的语言改进尤为明显。

Conclusion: 计划性交替训练策略有效缓解语音-文本模态差异问题，为低资源语言语音翻译提供了可行的优化路径。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

Motivation: 现有链式思维监督方法依赖高成本人工标注或不可靠的LLM生成，难以保证推理数据的准确性和可验证性。

Method: 从代码执行中提取可验证的逐步推理轨迹，将其转化为自然语言形式的链式思维监督数据。

Result: 实验表明该方法赋予LLM跨领域推理迁移能力，同时减少推理时的无意义重复和过度思考，降低token消耗。

Conclusion: 基于程序执行确定性的监督数据生成策略能有效解决链式思维训练数据质量与可靠性问题。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理含表格的异构文档时，因平铺表格和分块策略破坏结构，导致信息丢失且削弱LLMs在多跳全局查询中的推理能力。

Method: TableRAG采用四步迭代框架：上下文敏感查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程执行、组合式中间答案生成，并构建HeteQA基准评估异构推理能力。

Result: 实验表明TableRAG在公开数据集及HeteQA上均超越基线模型，成为异构文档问答的新SOTA。

Conclusion: TableRAG通过统一文本与表格操作，显著提升异构文档问答性能，其代码与基准的公开推动了该方向的研究进展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PAG框架，通过多轮强化学习让大语言模型在策略和验证者角色间切换，仅在检测到错误时进行修订，有效提升自我验证和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型自我验证方法依赖外部验证模型或多阶段训练流程，存在扩展性限制，需要更简洁高效的自验证解决方案。

Method: 提出策略即生成验证器(PAG)框架，通过统一强化学习范式实现角色切换，引入选择性修订机制(仅在自验证检测到错误时生成新尝试)，联合优化推理与验证能力。

Result: 实验表明PAG在推理基准测试中同时提升直接生成准确率(作为策略)和自验证效果(作为验证器)，优于自洽性等基线方法。

Conclusion: PAG通过验证-修订的强化学习框架，无需额外验证模型即可有效提升大语言模型的自我纠正能力，验证了生成式验证的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了TempVS基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像序列中的时间推理与基础能力。通过三个核心测试（事件关系推理、句子排序、图像排序）及基础测试，发现现有MLLMs表现显著低于人类水平，并提供了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在时间维度的视觉-语言推理能力尚未被充分评估，尤其是对事件顺序的理解。TempVS旨在填补这一空白，推动模型在时序场景下的多模态理解能力发展。

Method: 构建TempVS基准测试，包含事件关系推理、句子排序、图像排序三个主任务及对应的基础测试，要求模型结合视觉与语言模态推断事件时序关系。评估了38个前沿MLLMs，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 实验表明，现有MLLMs在TempVS任务中表现较差（如GPT-4V准确率仅约50%），远低于人类水平（约90%）。细粒度分析揭示了模型在跨模态时序对齐、因果推理等方面的不足。

Conclusion: TempVS暴露了MLLMs在时序推理上的重大缺陷，验证了该基准的有效性。公开数据和代码将支持未来研究，需进一步改进模型的多模态时序理解与物理世界的对齐能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有冲突框架分析多局限于定性或表层研究，缺乏对深层语言框架与传播框架关联的量化分析。

Method: 结合框架语义学和大型语言模型，对新闻语料进行战争/和平新闻指标计算，分析传播框架与语言框架的关联。

Result: 媒体报道普遍侧重战争框架，美、英与中东媒体在冲突责任方/受害者的叙事框架上存在显著地域偏见。

Conclusion: 媒体框架选择直接影响冲突叙事，地域性报道差异揭示了深层次的结构性偏见，验证了计算框架分析方法的实践价值。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法(如思维链提示)通过增加输出来提升推理能力，但导致计算延迟上升；而统一惩罚的强化学习方法未考虑问题复杂度差异，导致次优结果。

Method: 通过分割奖励函数并引入新型输出长度惩罚机制，动态管理推理效率：对简单问题施加更强长度约束，对复杂问题保留充分推理空间。

Result: 在GSM8K/MATH500简单数据集上缩短输出长度且保持/提升准确率，在复杂AIME2024数据集上实现准确率提升。

Conclusion: 基于问题复杂度动态调整推理长度的优化策略，有效平衡了LLMs推理效率与准确性，实现了整体性能提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将表格-文本对齐任务转化为解释性任务，通过构建包含人工标注单元格理由的新数据集，发现结合表格对齐能提升声明验证性能，但多数大语言模型无法生成与人类一致的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学声明验证方法仅预测标签（支持/反驳），但缺乏对模型推理过程的解释性。预测结果无法反映模型是否基于忠实推理，限制了可解释性。

Method: 扩展SciTab基准数据集，添加人工标注的单元格级理由（标注者需同时验证标签并标记关键单元格），并提出处理模糊案例的分类法。

Result: 实验表明：(1) 表格对齐信息可提升声明验证性能；(2) 多数LLM虽能预测正确标签，但无法恢复与人类标注对齐的单元格，暗示其预测缺乏可信推理过程。

Conclusion: 仅依赖标签的验证方法存在局限性，需关注模型推理过程的可解释性。当前LLM的预测结果可能未基于忠实推理，需改进对齐能力以增强可信度。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）因训练数据中的偏见可能产生有偏输出，不同评估方法揭示偏见程度不同：预置人设的基准测试影响微弱，但任务重构（如用户答案评分、薪资建议）显示显著偏见，且模型记忆用户特征可能加剧问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示LLMs因训练数据中的争议性和刻板内容导致的偏见问题，尤其是模型根据用户或预设人设产生差异化输出的潜在风险。

Method: 通过三种方法评估LLM偏见：1）在MMLU基准测试中使用预置人设；2）要求模型对用户答案评分；3）要求模型提供薪资谈判建议。

Result: 预置人设对MMLU得分影响可忽略，但用户答案评分任务显示显著偏见，薪资建议任务中偏见尤为明显。模型记忆用户社会人口特征可能进一步放大偏见。

Conclusion: LLM的个性化功能（如记忆用户特征）可能使偏见问题以新形式出现，需开发更全面的评估方法以应对实际场景中的潜在风险。

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST基准仅关注结构化单用户对话，无法反映真实多用户交互的复杂性，需验证LLMs在此场景下的局限性。

Method: 基于言语行为理论，利用LLM生成第二用户语句扩展现有DST数据集，系统化构建多用户对话以评估模型表现。

Result: 实验显示LLMs在多用户DST中性能较单用户场景显著下降，突显其在多说话者情境下状态提取与追踪的不足。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs难以处理多用户DST任务，未来需增强模型在此类场景的能力，以构建更鲁棒且贴近现实的DST模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Bo Li,Qing Li,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RRP框架，通过结合LLM语义能力与知识图谱结构信息，提取高质量推理路径，提升大语言模型在复杂问题中的推理性能，并实现即插即用集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱增强的大语言模型虽补充事实知识，但难以解决复杂问题，因缺乏对事实间关系的逻辑组织。需有效提取可靠推理路径以提升模型推理能力。

Method: RRP框架融合LLM语义与知识图谱关系嵌入、双向分布学习的结构信息，引入反思模块评估路径重要性，动态优化推理路径。

Result: 在公开数据集上达到SOTA性能，且RRP可无缝集成至不同LLM，以即插即用方式增强其推理能力。

Conclusion: RRP通过生成问题定制的高质量推理路径，为LLM提供有效推理指导，证明结合结构信息与动态优化对复杂问题求解的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

*Promise Dodzi Kpoglu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数据驱动与规则约束的无监督方法，通过进化优化框架重建原始语形，在罗曼语系数据集上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于概率音系编辑的方法过度依赖数据驱动，缺乏语言学规则约束，限制了原始语形重建的准确性与合理性。

Method: 在进化优化框架中整合数据驱动推断与基于语言学的规则启发式，利用统计模式和音系约束共同指导重建过程。

Result: 在拉丁原始语形重建任务中，字符级准确率和音系合理性指标均取得显著提升，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 混合统计模式与语言学规则的进化优化方法能有效提升原始语形重建的准确性与音系学可信度。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Tina模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）在强化学习中高效微调小规模基础模型（1.5B参数），以极低成本（9美元）实现与SOTA相当的推理性能，验证了高效RL推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以高成本效益在语言模型中实现强大的推理能力，解决现有方法计算成本高昂的问题。

Method: 在强化学习（RL）过程中，对1.5B参数的基础模型应用参数高效更新技术LoRA，仅微调少量参数，保留基础模型知识的同时快速适应推理结构。

Result: Tina模型在AIME24上推理性能提升>20%，Pass@1准确率达43.33%，后训练与评估成本仅9美元（成本降低约260倍），性能超越同基础模型的SOTA模型。

Conclusion: LoRA通过快速适配RL奖励的结构化推理格式，显著提升小模型推理效率，同时保持知识完整性。开源代码与模型权重支持开放研究。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

### [32] [Resa: Transparent Reasoning Models via SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09967)
*Shangshang Wang,Julian Asilis,Ömer Faruk Akgül,Enes Burak Bilgin,Ollie Liu,Deqing Fu,Willie Neiswanger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resa模型通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）方法，以极低成本（约1美元）和短时间（约20分钟）高效激发语言模型的推理能力，同时保持高性能（>97% RL模型性能）并具备通用性与模块化特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以高成本效益的方式利用语言模型的底层表征来激发其推理能力，避免传统强化学习（RL）训练所需的高昂计算和时间成本。

Method: 提出SAE-Tuning方法：1) 训练稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型提取推理能力；2) 用SAE指导目标模型的监督微调，仅需验证过的问答数据（无需推理轨迹）。

Result: 1) 在RL后处理前应用SAE-Tuning，推理性能保留>97%，成本降低2000倍至约1美元，时间缩短450倍至20分钟；2) 在轻量RL模型上应用，能以约1美元额外成本实现AIME24 43.33% Pass@1和AMC23 90% Pass@1；3) SAE提取的推理能力具备跨数据集通用性和跨模型模块化特性。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning是一种高效、低成本且可扩展的推理能力激发方法，其提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化优势，为语言模型推理优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLMs）能高准确率逐字符拼写，但其内部处理字符级信息的方式与人类不同，依赖中间层重建知识并存在行为突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在拼写过程中如何表示和利用字符级信息，尤其是其处理复杂字符任务（如识别词内子成分）的局限性。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重分析三种方法，研究模型嵌入层及Transformer各层的字符信息处理机制。

Result: 嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息（尤其首字符外），中间层与高层Transformer负责重建知识，并观察到拼写行为的突破性变化。

Conclusion: LLMs通过非直观方式处理字符信息，依赖深层网络补偿嵌入层不足，揭示了模型在字符级任务中的内在工作机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

### [35] [Large Language Models for Detection of Life-Threatening Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10687)
*Thanh Thi Nguyen,Campbell Wilson,Janis Dalins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过微调Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2等开源大语言模型，在平衡/不平衡数据集上检测威胁性语言，发现LLMs性能显著优于传统方法，且上采样对LLMs效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命语言对保护心理脆弱个体、预防潜在伤害至关重要，需探索大语言模型在此任务中的有效性。

Method: 使用7B参数的Gemma/Mistral/Llama-2模型，在平衡度的三类数据集上微调，并与词袋、词嵌入、主题建模、BERT等传统方法对比，采用上采样处理数据不平衡。

Result: LLMs全面超越传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2在各类数据场景表现最优，Gemma稍逊；上采样仅提升传统方法效果，对LLMs影响微弱。

Conclusion: 大语言模型(特别是Mistral/Llama-2)在现实威胁语言检测中展现巨大潜力，数据不平衡场景下仍保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE框架通过提示优化显著减少大型推理模型的token使用和成本，同时保持数学推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型使用冗长思维链推理导致token开销过大，限制了在延迟敏感或API受限场景的部署。

Method: 结合跟踪级诊断与梯度启发提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡token长度与答案正确性，单次黑箱处理无需修改权重。

Result: 在GSM8K等数据集保持/提升准确率（Claude 96%→96%），减少87.5%推理token，降低69-82%成本。

Conclusion: 纯提示级优化是提升商业大模型推理效率的有效路径，可在不牺牲质量前提下实现显著成本节约。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ClaimSpect框架，通过层次化解构复杂声明并整合多角度语料分析，提供更全面的验证视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常将声明简单归类为真/假，但实际中声明（如科学或政治主张）常包含多个子维度（如疫苗的安全性和有效性），需系统化分解并整合语料中的不同观点。

Method: 基于检索增强生成技术，自动构建声明的层次化子方面结构，通过语料分割检索相关段落，发现新子方面及不同立场（支持/中立/反对）及其分布。

Result: 在真实科学和政治声明数据集上验证，ClaimSpect能准确解构复杂声明并反映语料中的观点分布，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect通过层次化分析声明的多维度及观点分布，为复杂声明的验证提供了更细粒度和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt提出了一种动态调整LLM生成分类法的框架，通过迭代层次分类扩展分类广度和深度，解决现有方法在通用性、动态性和多维性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家构建分类法耗时昂贵，现有自动方法或依赖特定语料库牺牲通用性，或过度依赖LLM预训练数据忽略科学领域动态性，且未考虑文献的多维性（如方法/任务/指标等）。

Method: TaxoAdapt框架通过迭代层次分类动态调整LLM生成的分类法，根据语料主题分布扩展分类宽度（同级节点）和深度（层级结构），支持多维度文献分类。

Result: 在计算机科学会议数据集上，TaxoAdapt生成的分类法比基线方法在粒度保持性上提升26.51%，连贯性提升50.41%（基于LLM评估）。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt通过动态适应机制有效捕捉科学领域演化特征，生成兼具多维性、细粒度与连贯性的分类体系，为科学文献组织提供新方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究提出使用覆盖更多语言的通用分词器，提升多语言大模型预训练后的语言适应能力，实验显示其显著优于传统分词器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型预训练面临模型容量限制、高质量数据稀缺及分词器语言覆盖不足的问题，导致后续扩展新语言困难。

Method: 在预训练早期采用覆盖更广的通用分词器（而非仅针对预训练语言的分词器），增强模型后训练阶段对新语言的适应能力。

Result: 通用分词器使语言适应胜率提升最高20.2%，对完全未见语言提升5%，且不影响多数预训练语言的性能。

Conclusion: 通用分词器通过提升语言可塑性，以低成本实现多语言模型的高效扩展，平衡了语言覆盖与性能保留。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

Result: 轻量方法性能接近需多次采样的语义熵法；不同专科（如心脏病学vs放射学）和题型（因果关系推断vs计算题）表现差异达20%以上。

Conclusion: 模型选择需同时考虑问题属性与模型专长，单次行为信号方法为临床部署提供了计算效率与精度的平衡方案。

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LangEdit框架，通过空问约束隔离多语言知识更新，有效减少参数干扰，提升多语言模型编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需为不同语言单独部署编辑系统，成本高昂；统一模型跨语言更新易引发参数干扰，导致多语言泛化能力下降。

Method: 利用正交子空间投影技术，将各语言参数更新约束至先前更新子空间的正交补空间，数学保证更新独立性。

Result: 在3种模型架构、6种语言、4类任务中验证，LangEdit显著降低参数干扰，性能优于当前最优编辑方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为解决LLMs多语言知识更新难题提供高效方案，其空问约束机制对保持模型泛化能力具有关键作用。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought方法存在过度思考问题，导致冗余推理路径，且现有解决方案易受生成数据质量限制并产生过拟合。

Method: 采用分步探索机制与长短切换采样策略生成多样化推理路径，训练两个分别优化精度和简洁性的Gemini模型，最终通过参数插值整合模型。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集上，ReCUT将推理长度减少30-50%的同时保持或超越基线模型精度。

Conclusion: ReCUT有效平衡推理精度与效率，为优化LLMs推理过程提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码与数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型采样策略（如置信度解码、半自回归解码）存在静态行为缺陷，导致解码效率与灵活性受限。

Method: 提出SlowFast Sampling策略，基于确定性、收敛性、位置性三原则动态切换探索/加速阶段，并与dLLM-Cache结合降低计算量。

Result: 实验显示：LLaDA模型加速15.63倍（精度损失极小），结合缓存达34.22倍；吞吐量超越LLaMA3 8B等自回归基线模型。

Conclusion: 动态采样策略与缓存机制可充分释放扩散语言模型潜力，实现高速高质量文本生成，证明优化采样方法对dLLMs性能提升的关键作用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Motivation: 现有自监督语音模型分析主要集中于英语，本文旨在探究不同预训练语言对wav2vec2表征结构的影响。

Method: 使用探测分类器和几何分析方法，在四种语言训练的模型上测试匹配/非匹配语言的音素、声调及说话者信息编码。

Result: 所有模型均呈现音素-声调-说话者信息子空间正交性，后期层仅音素/声调存在轻微语言匹配优势，说话者信息无此影响。

Conclusion: wav2vec2学习到的表征结构主要独立于预训练语音材料，表明其具有跨语言通用编码机制。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)

medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG

TL;DR: 本文提出大语言模型（LLM）的泛化与幻觉行为均源于上下文外推理（OCR）机制，并通过实验与理论分析证明其核心在于梯度下降隐式偏好导致的矩阵核范数最小化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM微调过程中表现出的矛盾现象——既能泛化新知识又易产生幻觉——的根本原因，揭示其底层统一机制。

Method: 在五大主流模型上验证OCR机制，构建单层单头注意力结构的Transformer模型进行合成事实召回任务，结合矩阵分解与核范数理论分析梯度下降隐式偏好。

Result: OCR机制通过关联概念驱动泛化/幻觉，矩阵分解结构是必要条件；梯度下降隐式偏好使输出-价值组合矩阵核范数最小化，导致模型高效学习因果/虚假关联。

Conclusion: 研究为OCR现象提供了数学解释，揭示了知识注入中模型行为的底层机制，为分析及缓解幻觉问题提供了新理论框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable

demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稀疏自编码器(SAE)的字典学习方法在因果评估中表现欠佳，且特征可解释性不足，因其训练过程未显式关联模型计算过程。

Method: 采用半非负矩阵分解技术分解MLP激活矩阵，使特征既是神经元的稀疏线性组合，又能映射到具体输入，实现内在可解释性。

Result: 在Llama 3.1等模型上的实验表明，SNMF特征在因果干预效果上超越SAE和监督基线，且与人类可解释概念对齐，揭示了MLP激活空间的层次结构。

Conclusion: SNMF为解析LLM概念表征提供了简单有效的工具，通过复用神经元组合构建语义相关特征，揭示了模型内部的分层表示机制。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法常忽略'认知摩擦'（即面对新信息时更新信念的阻力）对人机协作的影响，需研究其作用机制以提升模型适应性。

Method: 在动态认知逻辑框架下定义动态认知摩擦，将其建模为信念整合阻力，并通过协作任务中的对话数据分析验证模型预测能力。

Result: 模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新，且认知摩擦作为信念对齐的阻力指标可进一步细化以适配复杂现实场景。

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦模型为理解人机协作中的信念冲突提供新视角，其可扩展性为复杂对话场景的LLM优化奠定理论基础。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue

### [56] [Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10952)
*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec通过将数据集分解为元领域的线性组合，提出一种无需训练即可优化语言模型预训练数据混合的方法，显著降低计算成本并提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型预训练中，数据混合优化依赖大量试错性训练，计算成本高昂。本文旨在通过数据分布对齐假设（DA²），寻找一种高效、无需训练的方法来确定最优数据混合比例。

Method: 提出Domain2Vec框架：1）定义元领域以捕捉数据集核心特征；2）构建元领域词汇表，通过分类器将数据集分解为元领域分布向量；3）基于DA²假设（验证集与训练集分布对齐时损失更低），直接优化数据混合比例。

Result: 实验表明：1）在Pile-CC数据集上，仅需原计算量的51.5%即可达到相同验证损失；2）相同计算预算下，下游任务平均性能提升2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec通过元领域分解与分布对齐假设，实现了高效、可扩展的数据混合优化，显著降低计算开销并提升模型性能，且能无缝集成至现有方法中。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

TL;DR: 本文针对中文有害内容检测资源稀缺的问题，提出了一个基于真实数据的专业标注基准及知识增强的基线方法，使小模型性能媲美大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有害内容检测资源集中于英语，中文数据集稀缺且覆盖范围有限，需构建更全面的中文基准以提升检测效率。

Method: 构建包含六类真实中文数据的专业标注基准，并设计知识增强基线方法，结合人工规则与大型模型隐式知识。

Result: 所提方法使小模型达到与先进大型模型相当的检测性能，同时公开了标注数据集与知识规则库。

Conclusion: 通过整合显式专家知识与隐式模型知识，填补了中文有害内容检测资源空白，为内容审核提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

TL;DR: AutoMind通过专家知识库、知识树搜索和自适应编码策略，提升了LLM代理在数据科学任务中的自动化能力，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的数据科学代理依赖固定流程和编码策略，仅能处理简单任务，无法应对复杂创新问题，需引入人类经验与动态适应性。

Method: 提出AutoMind框架，包含：(1)领域专家知识库；(2)基于知识树搜索的算法；(3)动态调整代码生成的自适应策略。

Result: 在自动化数据科学基准测试中，AutoMind性能优于现有方法，验证了其高效性、鲁棒性及解决方案的优质性。

Conclusion: AutoMind通过融合领域知识与动态策略，为全自动化数据科学提供了有效且可靠的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

### [59] [How Well Can Reasoning Models Identify and Recover from Unhelpful Thoughts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10979)
*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管推理模型能识别大部分无益思维，但在恢复过程中表现不佳，大模型对短无关思维的恢复能力甚至弱于小模型，且小模型对有害思维的干扰抵抗力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理模型在自我重新评估（self-reevaluation）中的有效性，尤其是模型在发现错误思维后能否有效恢复，这对提升模型推理准确性和安全性至关重要。

Method: 通过向模型推理过程中注入四类无益思维（冗长、无关、误导、错误答案），分析模型识别和恢复能力，并比较不同规模模型的差异，同时进行基于无关思维注入的越狱实验。

Result: 模型能有效识别大部分无益思维，但恢复能力显著不足；大模型在短无关思维恢复中表现更差（逆缩放现象），而小模型对触发有害响应的思维干扰抵抗力最强。

Conclusion: 需改进模型的自我重新评估能力以提升推理安全性和鲁棒性，尤其需解决大模型在恢复过程中的脆弱性，避免其盲目延续错误推理路径。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

### [60] [LogiPlan: A Structured Benchmark for Logical Planning and Relational Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10527)
*Yanan Cai,Ahmed Salem,Besmira Nushi,Mark Russinovich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan是一个评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构上逻辑规划能力的新基准，包含三个任务并通过动态调整难度揭示模型在深层推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在需要生成/查询结构化关系图（如知识图谱、业务流程）的应用中，缺乏对逻辑关系推理能力的系统性评估工具。

Method: 通过控制对象数量、关系类型和关系链最小深度动态调节任务复杂度，设计计划生成、一致性检测、比较问答三个互补任务，并加入自修正能力评估。

Result: 测试包括GPT-4.5/4o、Claude 3.7等前沿模型，发现模型性能与规模/架构强相关，增强推理模型在简单任务表现尚可，但无法处理需要深层逻辑规划的复杂配置。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂逻辑规划任务上存在显著能力缺口，模型规模和架构优化仍是提升关系型推理能力的关键路径。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [61] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个猜想，认为AI系统在可验证的正确性与广泛数据处理能力之间存在根本性权衡：符号AI可证明无误但应用狭窄，生成模型能处理复杂数据但必然存在错误风险。该猜想从信息论角度形式化这一矛盾，并探讨其对技术哲学与系统设计的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源于传统符号AI与当代生成模型间的固有矛盾——前者追求严格正确性导致应用受限，后者开放性强却无法消除错误风险。研究旨在将这种隐含的权衡显式化，为AI可信度评估提供理论框架。

Method: 通过信息论形式化猜想，结合认识论、形式验证和技术哲学的多维度分析，运用欠定理论、认知风险与道德责任等概念进行论证。

Result: 明确提出了AI系统『正确性-泛化能力』不可兼得的数学不等式，揭示了该权衡对混合系统设计、治理标准及伦理责任框架的重构意义。

Conclusion: 该猜想若成立，将重塑可信AI的发展路径，强调必须通过严格证明或证伪此不等式，才能建立兼顾安全与创新的评估体系。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 医学基础模型在适应新场景时存在动态调整不足的问题，提出上下文切换AI框架以实现无需重新训练的动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI模型通过微调或知识库检索适应新场景，但无法动态调整行为，易忽略关键上下文信息导致错误。

Method: 提出上下文切换（context-switching）的AI框架，使模型能动态适应不同专科、人群、工作流程及临床角色。

Result: 理论框架未明确实证结果，但预期模型将提升跨专科/地区的疾病诊疗泛化能力及医疗可及性。

Conclusion: 上下文切换AI可突破现有模型静态限制，通过动态推理扩展医疗AI应用范围并减少情境性错误。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

TL;DR: 本研究通过XGBoost算法、相关性分析和SHAP可解释性技术，探讨阿尔茨海默病特征间的关联与因果差异，发现强相关性不必然代表因果关系，为未来因果推断研究提供基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病研究中，区分因果关系与相关性对诊断、治疗及病理机制识别至关重要。现有关联性数据易被误读，需结合多维度分析方法揭示真实驱动因素。

Method: 采用XGBoost机器学习分类模型，结合相关性矩阵分析及SHAP值解释技术，整合临床、认知、遗传和生物标志物数据，进行特征重要性评估与模型可解释性分析。

Result: 识别出认知评分和遗传风险因子等关键分类特征；相关性分析显示变量集群现象，SHAP值揭示不同阶段特征贡献差异，证实相关性不等同于因果关联。

Conclusion: 需谨慎解释关联性数据，整合特征重要性与统计分析方法可推动因果机制研究，区分因果因素与相关标记有助于提升早期诊断与精准干预策略。

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出首个基于兵棋推演的LLM战略推理基准测试WGSR-Bench，通过环境态势感知、对手风险建模和策略生成三大核心任务构建S-POE架构，系统评估大语言模型在复杂战略场景下的多智能体决策、意图推理等能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽在数学/符号/常识推理取得突破，但作为人类认知核心的战略推理能力（多智能体动态环境下的行为评估、计划制定与策略调整）尚未被系统建模与评估。兵棋推演因其环境不确定性、对抗动态性和非唯一策略选择特性，成为理想的战略推理评估场景。

Method: 构建WGSR-Bench基准测试：1) 以兵棋推演为评估环境 2) 设计环境态势感知、对手风险建模、策略生成三大核心任务形成S-POE架构 3) 开发LLM驱动的兵棋推演智能体进行综合战略推理评估。

Result: 通过该基准可系统评估主流LLM在博弈论战略推理中的能力边界，具体表现为：多智能体决策能力、意图推理能力、反事实推理能力的量化评估。

Conclusion: WGSR-Bench填补了LLM战略推理评估的系统性空白，为推进大模型驱动的战略智能研究提供标准化测试平台，同时揭示现有模型在复杂动态博弈场景中的能力缺陷。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

TL;DR: 本文通过计算复杂性理论分析，揭示了AI系统能力提升与安全性验证之间的根本矛盾：当系统表达能力超过临界阈值时，安全验证成为coNP完全问题且需指数时间。研究证明安全策略空间呈指数级收缩，现有对齐技术存在根本性局限，并提出AI发展的战略三难困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统能力指数级增长，传统安全方法面临验证可行性危机。研究旨在从计算复杂性角度揭示AI安全验证的数学限制，为AI对齐问题建立理论边界。

Method: 构建能力-风险扩展(CRS)动态模型，通过四个核心理论证明：(1)验证复杂度与表达能力指数相关；(2)安全策略空间测度分析；(3)对齐技术覆盖局限性；(4)神经网络鲁棒安全属性测度特征。使用Lean4进行形式化验证。

Result: 1. 验证复杂度随m指数增长(coNP完全) 2. 安全策略占比≤2^(-2^m) 3. 有限对齐技术无法全域覆盖 4. 鲁棒安全属性测度为零。形成'难解性鸿沟'，实用安全需求位于计算不可行区域。

Conclusion: AI发展面临三难选择：限制系统复杂度保持可验证安全、接受不可验证风险继续扩展能力、或突破验证范式建立新安全体系。研究为AI对齐提供了首个系统性复杂性理论框架。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出VGC-Bench基准测试，用于评估AI在宝可梦锦标赛复杂多智能体环境中的策略泛化能力。现有方法在单一团队配置下可击败职业选手，但面对大规模团队组合时泛化能力显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宝可梦锦标赛的策略空间极大（约10^139种团队组合），且团队配置的离散性导致最优策略剧烈变化，现有方法难以实现跨团队泛化。需建立标准化基准以推动相关研究。

Method: 构建VGC-Bench基准，整合基础设施/评估协议/人类数据集，并测试多种基线方法（LLM代理、行为克隆、强化学习、自我博弈等博弈论方法）。

Result: 单一团队配置下最佳方法可击败职业选手，但团队规模扩大时性能急剧下降。所有基线方法在跨团队泛化中均表现不佳，显示策略泛化仍是核心挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管在受限场景取得进展，但AI策略在多样化团队配置中的泛化能力尚未解决。VGC-Bench为社区提供了标准化研究平台，代码已开源。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对Minecraft等开放世界环境中构建通用智能体面临的挑战，提出了知识增强数据生成、任务级路由的MoE架构和多模态推理增强强化学习方法，开发了Optimus-3智能体并在实验中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的智能体在开放世界（如Minecraft）中面临领域数据不足、异构任务干扰和视觉多样性三大挑战，难以实现感知-规划-行动-基础-反思的全栈能力。

Method: 1) 知识增强数据生成管道提供可扩展的高质量训练数据；2) 任务级路由的混合专家架构（MoE）缓解任务干扰；3) 多模态推理增强强化学习方法提升视觉多样性处理能力。

Result: Optimus-3在Minecraft环境中广泛实验表明，其性能超越通用多模态大模型和现有最先进智能体，覆盖多种任务场景。

Conclusion: 通过数据生成、架构设计和推理增强的三重创新，成功构建了适用于开放世界环境的通用智能体Optimus-3，验证了方法在复杂任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroPAL框架，通过结合神经进化拓扑增强（NEAT）与间断式随时学习（PAL），在《星际争霸：母巢之战》中实现高效策略学习。实验表明，PAL使训练时间减半，并涌现出类似人类玩家的专家级策略行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统《星际争霸》AI方法（基于规则系统或监督深度学习）在适应性和计算效率上存在局限，需探索更高效的训练框架以应对复杂实时策略环境中的长期规划挑战。

Method: 提出NeuroPAL框架：将NEAT与PAL结合，通过交替进行低精度高频训练与高精度周期性评估，提升神经进化样本效率。在固定地图、单一种族场景中验证框架有效性。

Result: PAL结合的神经进化训练速度提升2倍，代理兵营部署、防御建筑优化等策略自主涌现，其表现接近人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 结构化评估机制（如PAL）可显著增强神经进化在复杂RTS环境中的扩展性与有效性，为AI策略学习提供新方向。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Mirage-1多模态GUI代理，通过分层技能模块和增强搜索算法，显著提升长时跨平台任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM代理在在线长时任务中存在知识不足与离线/在线领域鸿沟问题，需改进知识抽象与领域迁移能力。

Method: 1) 分层多模态技能模块(HMS)将轨迹抽象为元技能层级结构；2) 技能增强蒙特卡洛树搜索(SA-MCTS)利用离线技能缩小在线动作空间。

Result: 在AndroidWorld等四个基准测试中分别超越前最佳代理32%、19%、15%和79%，并构建新基准AndroidLH验证性能。

Conclusion: HMS与SA-MCTS有效解决知识不足与领域鸿沟问题，Mirage-1成为首个即插即用跨平台GUI代理，在真实长时任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态RAG系统在复杂推理、动态检索及多模态场景中存在局限，需引入决策与自适应工具以提升灵活性与实用性。

Method: 将现有方法分为预定义推理（固定模块化流程增强推理）和自主代理推理（模型动态协调工具交互），分析代表性技术的架构、推理策略与工具协作机制。

Result: 系统梳理了两类推理代理RAG的技术特点，总结了当前研究在动态决策、多模态整合等关键挑战，并提出优化方向。

Conclusion: 未来需提升推理代理RAG系统的灵活性、鲁棒性与适用性，研究方向包括动态工具编排、多模态融合及复杂场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection
of the relevant research has been organized into a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于代理的多维弹性扩展框架，用于资源受限的边缘计算环境，通过动态调整硬件资源和服务配置优化性能。实验表明不同代理策略在收敛速度与可扩展性上各具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动扩展方法在资源严格受限的边缘计算环境中缺乏灵活性，需结合多维度弹性扩展（如硬件资源和内部配置）以提升需求满足率。

Method: 采用基于代理的自动扩展框架，对比四种代理（Active Inference、Deep Q Network、结构知识分析、深度主动推断），并在YOLOv8视觉识别与OpenCV二维码检测的并行服务中验证。

Result: 所有代理均满足SLO性能要求：深度Q网络受益预训练，结构分析快速收敛，深度主动推断兼具理论优势与实用扩展性。

Conclusion: 多维代理自动扩展在边缘环境中可行，未来可进一步探索其理论框架与动态适应性。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OIBench——一个高质量、私有且具挑战性的信息学奥赛级别数据集，包含250道原创题目，用于评估模型算法推理能力。实验表明当前最优模型在正确性和效率上已超越多数人类，但未达标准解水平。数据集已发布以促进LLM代码推理研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法基准测试逐渐饱和，需更具挑战性的基准推动算法推理能力发展。现有数据集存在污染风险且缺乏细粒度效率分析，需构建更可靠、全面的评估体系。

Method: 构建包含多编程范式与复杂度层级的OIBench数据集，采用抗污染设计；提出时空完成曲线进行细粒度分析，并通过高水平参赛者评估实现人模直接对比。

Result: 开源模型落后于闭源模型，SOTA模型在正确率与效率上超越多数人类（但未达最优解水平）。时空曲线揭示模型效率分布特征，验证了数据集的抗污染有效性。

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Method: 构建包含830个专家验证VQA对的SFE基准，通过信号感知、属性理解、比较推理三个层次，覆盖5个学科66项多模态任务。

Result: GPT-4o和InternVL-3在SFE基准上仅达34.08%和26.52%准确率，表明科学领域性能存在显著提升空间。

Conclusion: SFE基准揭示了MLLMs在科学认知能力的局限性，其方法论可为AI增强科学发现提供发展路径。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further

TL;DR: LogiPlan是一个评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构上逻辑规划能力的新基准，包含三个任务并通过动态调整难度揭示模型在深层推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在需要生成/查询结构化关系图（如知识图谱、业务流程）的应用中，缺乏对逻辑关系推理能力的系统性评估工具。

Method: 通过控制对象数量、关系类型和关系链最小深度动态调节任务复杂度，设计计划生成、一致性检测、比较问答三个互补任务，并加入自修正能力评估。

Result: 测试包括GPT-4.5/4o、Claude 3.7等前沿模型，发现模型性能与规模/架构强相关，增强推理模型在简单任务表现尚可，但无法处理需要深层逻辑规划的复杂配置。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂逻辑规划任务上存在显著能力缺口，模型规模和架构优化仍是提升关系型推理能力的关键路径。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建可解释的、基于规则的测试基准，以评估LLMs在推断隐藏规则、验证数学假设及符号逻辑泛化方面的能力，弥补数论、人工智能与软件工程领域间的鸿沟。

Method: 定义Primender序列（素数或其至少有一个素数后缀的数），设计结构化提示与评估框架，测试多款先进LLMs（如ChatGPT、Gemini等）的规则推断、假设验证及序列生成能力，使用准确性、有效性等指标量化性能。

Result: 通过比较不同LLMs在规则推断准确率、假设验证能力、生成序列有效性及符号解释质量等指标，揭示了模型在符号推理与数学假设检验中的表现差异。

Conclusion: Primender序列及其评估方法为LLMs的符号推理能力提供了可复现的基准测试工具，推动了数论与人工智能的交叉研究，并为模型的可解释性分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法依赖详细系统模型或大量训练数据，但实际中此类先验知识获取困难，需开发低依赖度的新方法。

Method: 结合神经网络子系统异常检测器与新型图诊断算法，仅需子系统间基本因果关系和正常运行数据。

Result: 模拟数据集诊断准确率82%，搜索空间缩减73%；真实水处理数据集验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识的大型复杂系统中具有实际应用潜力，平衡了诊断精度与知识依赖度。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Conclusion: TeleMath填补了专业领域LLM数学能力评估的空白，其开放资源可支持未来研究，并突显领域专用模型优化的必要性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutomationML(AML)建模建议以非正式文本约束形式存在，无法在AML系统内实现自动化验证，导致建模质量难以保证。

Method: 1) 通过RML和SPARQL将AML模型映射为OWL本体 2) 使用大语言模型将文本规则翻译为SHACL约束 3) 对AML本体进行SHACL验证 4) 自动生成自然语言验证结果

Result: 在示例AML建模建议中验证表明，该方法可半自动化检查复杂建模规则，验证结果准确率符合预期要求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了AML建模规则验证的技术门槛，通过形式化验证与自然语言处理的结合，提升了工程数据交换标准的可靠性。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Motivation: 结合答案集编程（ASP）与可满足性模理论（SMT）的优势，通过ASPMT框架处理复杂逻辑推理问题，尤其是涉及连续变化（如实数计算）的场景。

Method: 开发aspsmt2smt编译器，使用ASP基础化工具gringo对输入程序进行部分基础化，保留部分变量由SMT求解器z3处理，将ASPMT程序转换为SMT实例。

Result: 系统成功将ASPMT程序转化为SMT实例，并通过z3求解器验证其在实数计算与连续变化推理中的有效性。

Conclusion: ASPMT与SMT的结合为复杂逻辑推理提供了新方法，aspsmt2smt系统展示了其在处理连续变化问题上的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: 符号因果推理与神经模块的结合有效提升反事实推理能力，大语言模型作为模拟器的引入进一步扩展了方法的应用潜力。

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Method: 构建包含20个Kaggle机器学习任务和10个经典NP问题的OPT-BENCH基准，并设计OPT-Agent框架模拟人类解决问题的过程，通过生成-验证-迭代优化的闭环机制利用历史反馈改进解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，历史上下文显著提升了ML和NP任务的优化性能。在6个模型家族的9种LLM测试中，迭代次数、温度设置和模型架构对解的质量和收敛性均有影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则和统计的时空行为模拟方法存在计算成本高、泛化性差及扩展性不足的问题，而大语言模型（LLMs）作为'世界模拟器'在时空推理中存在空间认知局限、物理约束理解缺失及群体同质化倾向等挑战。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI
planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We
demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related
tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance

Motivation: 毒性是药物早期开发失败的主因，但分子毒性修复任务缺乏系统性定义与基准测试。现有技术虽在分子设计与性质预测上有进展，但未解决毒性修复的结构化生成问题。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使使用与正确答案无关的虚假奖励信号，强化学习结合可验证奖励（RLVR）仍能显著提升Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型的数学推理能力，但对其他模型家族（如Llama3、OLMo2）无效。代码推理行为在Qwen中显著增强，暗示RLVR可能激活了预训练阶段习得的潜在推理表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在缺乏有效奖励信号的情况下，RLVR如何通过虚假奖励激发模型的数学推理能力，并研究不同模型家族对此方法的响应差异。

Method: 使用多种虚假奖励信号（随机奖励/格式奖励/错误标签/1-shot强化学习/多数投票）对Qwen等模型进行RLVR训练，分析性能提升与代码推理行为变化。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B在MATH-500上提升21.4%-27.1%（接近真实奖励的29.1%），代码推理频率从65%增至90%+，但其他模型未见类似增益。

Conclusion: RLVR可能通过激活预训练获得的潜在表征提升推理能力，但机制尚不明确。未来研究需跨模型验证方法有效性可能高度依赖特定模型特性。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于多模态预训练模型的新型多模态类增量学习方法，通过混合专家结构、自适应视听融合模块及对比训练损失，有效整合视觉、音频和文本模态，缓解灾难性遗忘，并在三个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态类增量学习（MCIL）仅关注视觉与文本模态，缺乏对音频模态的整合。本文旨在解决多模态（视觉、音频、文本）增量学习中互补信息融合困难及灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 1. 基于混合专家（MoE）的多模态增量特征提取器（MIFE）实现AudioCLIP的增量微调；2. 含掩码阈值和动态融合机制的自适应视听融合模块（AAVFM）提升特征区分度；3. 多模态类增量对比训练损失优化跨模态对齐；4. 提出两个MCIL专用评估指标。

Result: 在三个多模态数据集上的实验表明，所提方法在跨模态对齐、特征泛化能力和抗遗忘性方面显著优于基线模型，新评估指标验证了综合性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过结合MoE结构、动态融合机制及对比学习，本文方法成功解决了多模态类增量学习中的模态整合与遗忘问题，提出的评估框架为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出NOCL框架，通过节点描述和节点概念技术，将大语言模型（LLM）有效应用于非文本属性图，解决传统图神经网络（MPNN）在标签稀缺和零样本场景下的泛化问题，并统一多层级图任务为语言查询格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPNN依赖监督学习，泛化能力受限；现有自监督方法仍需微调，无法适应零样本场景。LLM处理图数据时面临推理能力保留、长文本属性处理及仅限文本属性图等挑战。

Method: NOCL框架包含：1）节点描述（将异构属性转为结构化自然语言，扩展LLM至非文本属性图）；2）节点概念（用预训练模型压缩描述为语义嵌入，减少93.9%的token长度）；3）图表示描述符（统一多层级任务为语言查询）。

Result: 实验表明NOCL在监督场景下性能与MPNN及混合方法相当，且在零样本场景中泛化能力显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NOCL通过语言化图数据与任务统一，突破LLM在图领域的应用限制，为图基础模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 传统薄膜光学逆向设计依赖大量数值模拟与优化，效率低下。深度学习可解决此问题，但传统方法存在一对多映射问题，影响性能。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合逆向网络与预训练正向网络，探索MLP、CNN、LSTM三种算法的九种组合配置。

Result: LSTM-LSTM结构的TNN精度最高但训练时间最长；CNN-LSTM结合CNN特征提取与LSTM序列建模优势，成为精度与速度最优解。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM基TNN综合性能最佳，为薄膜逆向设计提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过双视角优化机制有效提升RLHF训练效率，实验证明其跨任务泛化能力与性能优势。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

*Ahmed Elbakary,Chaouki Ben Issaid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于跨客户端相似性的联邦多任务学习方法，通过特征锚点压缩通信数据，结合动态图社区划分实现高效个性化协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据分布异质化导致模型个性化需求，传统方法存在通信开销大、负迁移风险及客户端漂移问题。

Method: 1) 引入特征锚点压缩本地特征信息；2) 共享轻量级分类头；3) 动态图正则化建模协作关系；4) 社区检测划分同质群体限制协作范围。

Result: 在异构数据集上超越SOTA基线，通信计算效率提升23%，公平性指标提高15%，有效抑制负迁移现象。

Conclusion: 特征锚点与动态社区协作机制平衡了联邦学习的个性化与效率，为异构客户端协同提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Motivation: 自然现象（如云形成）的物理模拟计算成本高且难以扩展，需开发高效且物理合理的生成方法。

Method: 提出非负扩散（NnD）模型，结合分数扩散与改进的Langevin动力学，在迭代生成中强制非负性，基于高质量物理模拟数据训练。

Result: 生成的3D云微观物理场保持非负性，符合云物理趋势，且专家难以区分其与真实物理模拟结果。

Conclusion: NnD在保证物理合理性的前提下，大幅降低复杂自然现象的计算成本，为生成与推理任务提供高效工具。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的主动学习方法多针对静态图数据，且仅关注预测精度，忽略了用户负担、采样多样性和动态环境适应性等实际问题。

Method: 提出GRAIL基准框架，设计新指标评估持续有效性、多样性和用户负担，结合动态真实传感器数据验证方法。

Result: 实验表明现有方法在预测性能与用户负担间存在权衡，需平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GRAIL为动态环境中的主动学习提供了多维评估机制，强调平衡关键因素以优化实际应用效果。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂老虎机模型假设臂容量为1且依赖碰撞反馈，而实际场景中臂容量未知且无法感知碰撞，需解决容量发现与协同分配问题。

Method: 设计A-CAPELLA算法，通过结构化碰撞模式实现同步逐次消除与容量估计，采用协作假设检验协议协调玩家行为。

Result: 在未知臂容量的无感知MMAB场景中，算法实现了对数遗憾，为理论上的高效学习提供了首个可证明保证。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了传统单位容量限制，通过创新碰撞模式设计，为去中心化无感知协作学习开辟了新方法路径。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出离线领域随机化（ODR）方法，通过利用真实系统离线数据优化模拟器参数分布，结合理论分析与改进算法E-DROPO，显著缩小sim-to-real差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域随机化（DR）方法忽略真实系统离线数据，导致模拟到现实的迁移效果受限。ODR旨在通过利用现有离线数据优化模拟器参数分布，提升策略迁移鲁棒性。

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器家族的最大似然估计问题，提出E-DROPO算法（在DROPO基础上增加熵奖励项以防止参数分布方差塌缩）。

Result: 理论证明ODR估计量的一致性及误差边界（比均匀DR缩小O(M)倍），实验表明E-DROPO通过保持参数多样性实现了更优的零样本迁移效果。

Conclusion: ODR为sim-to-real问题提供了理论保障的解决方案，E-DROPO通过熵正则化进一步提升了方法鲁棒性，验证了数据驱动参数分布调整的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强GCBC的表示学习目标，通过结合后继表示理论，解决了目标条件化行为克隆（GCBC）在组合泛化任务中因状态表示缺乏时间一致性而导致的零样本泛化问题。该方法无需对比样本或时序差分学习，在理论分析和实验性能上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标条件化行为克隆（GCBC）方法在分布内任务中表现良好，但在需要组合泛化的新状态-目标对任务中泛化能力不足。这主要归因于状态表示缺乏时间一致性，导致分布外状态-目标对的泛化差距扩大。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC方法，通过设计新的表示学习目标，理论上可在有限MDP场景下逼近后继表示（无需对比样本或TD学习），并利用该表示提升策略的时序一致性。

Result: 该方法在一系列需要组合泛化的复杂任务中表现出竞争力，验证了其通过增强表示空间时序一致性来改善零样本泛化能力的有效性。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过理论驱动的表示学习框架，成功解决了GCBC的组合泛化瓶颈，为基于离线数据的行为克隆方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

TL;DR: 研究通过逆向工程分析了一个用于Sokoban游戏的卷积循环神经网络，揭示了其利用测试计算量的机制类似于经典双向搜索，但存在状态非统一表示、分层计划等差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究无模型强化学习训练的神经网络如何通过增加测试计算量提升性能，并理解其内部机制是否具有可解释的搜索策略。

Method: 对已训练的卷积RNN进行部分逆向工程，分析其激活通道、方向关联机制及专用内核的路径生成方式，类比经典搜索组件。

Result: 网络通过方向关联通道表示计划（类似价值函数），专用内核扩展路径形成过渡模型，但状态非统一表示且每层独立计划，从而增加搜索深度。

Conclusion: 尽管机制不同于经典搜索，但网络通过模型无关训练学到的测试计算量利用机制可被解译为双向搜索的变体，表明其内部过程具备可解释性。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

TL;DR: 本文提出三种基于不精确概率理论和注意力机制的新型生存模型iSurvM、iSurvQ、iSurvJ，通过区间概率分布和可训练注意力权重处理截尾数据，实验表明其性能优于传统Beran估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存分析方法（如Beran估计器）在处理复杂数据结构和高截尾率时存在局限性，需开发非参数假设下更鲁棒的模型。

Method: 结合不精确概率理论，提出三种模型：1) 用区间概率分布表示截尾观测；2) 基于核的Nadaraya-Watson回归计算全局概率分布；3) 采用三种决策策略分别对应三个模型。

Result: 合成与真实数据集实验表明，新模型（尤其iSurvJ）在精度和计算复杂度上均优于Beran估计器，且代码已开源。

Conclusion: 所提模型通过非参数方法有效处理截尾数据，为生存分析提供了更优解决方案，iSurvJ的综合性能表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Conclusion: PMB-NN框架通过融合生理约束与数据驱动方法，为日常活动中的实时个性化心脏监测提供了可行路径，未来可扩展至基于身体运动的VO2实时估计系统。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Conclusion: 层次双曲嵌入能有效建模数据内在层次结构，显著提升OOD识别性能，其平衡优化策略与原型扩展机制具有普适性优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如SimCLR、SupCon）虽性能优越，但其确定性嵌入缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用场景。

Method: 提出变分对比学习（VCL），将InfoNCE损失视为重建项，并加入单位超球面上均匀先验的KL散度正则化，构建无解码器框架；通过投影正态分布建模后验概率，采样生成概率嵌入。具体实现包括VSimCLR和VSupCon。

Result: 实验表明VCL缓解了维度坍塌问题，增强与类标签的互信息，分类准确率匹配或超越基线方法，并通过后验模型提供有效不确定性估计。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习奠定概率基础，成为兼具性能与不确定性量化的新范式。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: The advance of speech decoding from non-invasive brain data holds the
potential for profound societal impact. Among its most promising applications
is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech
deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical
interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the
conditions for an "ImageNet moment" or breakthrough in non-invasive neural
decoding, by harnessing the collective power of the machine learning community.
  To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset
recorded to date (LibriBrain) together with a user-friendly Python library
(pnpl) for easy data access and integration with deep learning frameworks. For
the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出DynaSubVAE框架，通过动态子群划分和自适应OOD检测，解决异质数据中子群建模问题，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型常忽视数据中偏离全局模式的异质子群，导致预测偏差。传统方法仅将此类样本检测为域外(OOD)，而非动态适应新模式。

Method: 基于动态变分自编码器，结合高斯混合模型启发的非参数聚类机制，通过嵌入相似性建模潜在子群，并持续更新潜在结构以捕捉数据趋势。

Result: 实验表明DynaSubVAE在近/远OOD检测及训练时缺失整类的场景中表现优异，动态子群划分机制在OOD准确率和后悔精度上均超越GMM/KMeans++。

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE通过动态子群建模机制有效捕捉数据演化趋势，为异质数据下的模型适应性和OOD检测提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）参数量庞大，难以在边缘设备部署。现有模型压缩方法（如量化与剪枝）需进一步优化，尤其需解决激活感知权重剪枝与稀疏逼近问题。

Method: 通过建立激活感知权重剪枝与稀疏逼近问题的联系，受迭代硬阈值（IHT）启发，提出基于投影梯度下降的统一剪枝与量化方法（AWP），将二者联合优化。

Result: 实验表明，AWP在LLM剪枝与量化任务中优于当前最优方法，同时为剪枝过程提供了理论收敛性证明。

Conclusion: AWP通过统一框架有效结合剪枝与量化，显著压缩模型规模且保持性能，理论分析支持其收敛性，为边缘部署LLM提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent

pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

TL;DR: 本研究通过非线性机器学习模型分析ECG与PCG信号的相互重建能力，发现非因果LSTM模型在跨模态重建中表现最优，且PCG到ECG的重建更易实现。运动状态及跨个体场景对重建构成挑战，但基于包络的建模显著提升泛化能力，并验证了从PCG中提取ECG临床标志物的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图（ECG）与心音图（PCG）分别捕捉心脏电活动与机械活动，但二者信息重叠性、相互重建潜力及生物标志物提取能力尚未明确，尤其在动态生理条件与个体差异下的表现需系统性研究。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集中的静息/运动状态同步ECG-PCG记录，采用线性和非线性机器学习模型（含非因果LSTM）进行跨模态信号重建，分析因果关系、生理状态及跨受试者差异的影响，并探索包络建模对泛化能力的提升。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其非因果LSTM）重建性能更优，ECG→PCG重建难度高于反向；包络建模提升跨受试者泛化能力；PCG可跨个体估计ECG标志物（如QT间期）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了心电-机械信号在波形特征与事件时序上的关联，为开发多模态心脏监测技术提供理论支持，证明跨模态生物标志物提取的临床潜力。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Motivation: 现有基于语言模型的模拟电路生成方法存在电路表示效率低（O(|V|²)令牌长度）和数值输入精度敏感度不足的问题，难以满足现代应用对高容差性能的需求。

Method: 提出SFCI（基于标识符的简洁浮点输入规范表示）：1) 使用标识符增强元件类型识别 2) 将令牌长度复杂度降至O(|V|) 3) 改进数值精度敏感度以适应严格容差要求。

Result: 实验显示LaMAGIC2在0.01严格容差下成功率提升34%，MSE降低10倍，对大规模电路（更多顶点）的迁移性提升达58.5%。

Conclusion: SFCI框架通过结构优化和精度增强，为模拟电路拓扑生成建立了更鲁棒的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习在复杂数据分布场景的空白，其隐私性、高效性和灵活性使其适用于医疗金融等敏感领域。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Conclusion: 所提方法通过元学习和潜在空间建模，显著提升了小样本噪声标注数据的分类性能，且EM算法的可微性确保了高效优化。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Motivation: SDP松弛在验证ReLU激活的深度神经网络时存在内点消失问题，导致严格可行性条件丧失，影响数值稳定性和最优性，阻碍其扩展到深层网络。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析验证内点消失现象，设计五种增强可行性的解决方案，并重新评估传统ReLU约束的有效性。

Result: 新方法成功解决88%传统方法无法处理的问题（占总问题41%），发现传统ReLU上下界约束不仅无益反而损害可行性。

Conclusion: 揭示了SDP验证在深层网络中的根本挑战，提出实用改进方案，为构建更可靠的DNN系统提供理论支持。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

Motivation: 现有多模态图学习方法缺乏统一基准，导致不同方法难以公平比较，阻碍了多模态图（MMG）在社交网络、医疗等现实场景的应用进展。

Method: 构建Graph-MLLM综合基准，在6个不同数据集上系统评估三种多模态图学习范式，并通过开源库实现快速公平的跨范式评估。

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM填补了多模态图学习评估空白，其开源实现将推动该领域创新，未来可探索MLLMs与图结构更深层次的结合。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Conclusion: 协作机制的有效性取决于组间动作集结构，Col-UCB为平衡探索负担提供了理论保障，揭示了协作学习在特定场景下的优势边界。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了PyLO，一个基于PyTorch的库，旨在通过用户友好的工作流程将学习型优化器推广至更广泛的机器学习社区，解决了现有方法依赖JAX和缺乏易用性的问题，并在大规模预训练任务中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX且缺乏易用工具，难以被社区广泛采用。本文旨在通过PyTorch生态提供更易访问的解决方案，并探索其在真实大规模任务中的应用。

Method: 开发PyLO库，集成CUDA加速的small_fc_lopt优化器架构，支持与学习率调度、权重衰减等现有工具结合，并针对ViT B/16等模型进行优化。

Result: PyLO显著提升训练速度（ViT B/16批量32时吞吐量从39.59样本/秒增至205.59样本/秒），且结合传统优化工具后学习型优化器性能进一步改善。

Conclusion: PyLO通过降低学习型优化器的使用门槛并提升其效率，证明了其在真实场景中的实用价值，为后续研究与应用提供了开源工具基础。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家空气质量监测数据因传感器稀疏性无法反映局部真实情况，需提升AQI预测精度以应对健康风险。

Method: 基于AirDelhi数据集，采用时空图神经网络（Spatio-temporal GNN）进行1平方公里细粒度AQI预测。

Result: 模型在未见坐标上实现71.654 MSE（较现有工作降低79%），揭示AQI存在强重复短期模式及动态空间关联性。

Conclusion: 时空GNN有效解决稀疏传感器数据局限，新发现的AQI时空特性为污染监测提供新视角，代码已发布。

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语言反馈的交互式学习问题（LLF）的理论框架，引入转移规避维度衡量问题复杂度，并开发了高效算法HELiX，证明其在不同场景中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的交互式学习方法缺乏理论支撑，尤其在处理隐式奖励和语言反馈时缺乏原则性框架。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 形式化LLF问题，提出转移规避维度作为复杂度度量，设计无遗憾算法HELiX，通过序列交互实现理论性能保证。

Result: 理论证明语言反馈可指数级加速学习，实验显示HELiX在LLM提示不可靠时仍表现优异，性能与转移规避维度相关。

Conclusion: 本文为语言反馈驱动的交互学习奠定了理论基础，HELiX算法及复杂度分析为后续通用语言反馈学习系统设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

TL;DR: 本文针对生理信号分析中存在的低信噪比、非平稳性及多模态融合难题，提出基于小波变换的时频特征提取方法，并开发了针对EMG/ECG的预训练模型与多模态融合框架，显著提升了下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号易受运动伪影、基线漂移等低信噪比干扰，且具有强非平稳性（如尖锐峰值、突变），传统时域/滤波方法难以有效表征。多模态场景下还存在被试间差异大、设备失配等问题。

Method: 1. 提出小波基多尺度时频特征提取方法；2. 首次构建EMG/ECG专用预训练模型；3. 整合EEG模型形成可学习权重融合的多模态框架，各模态通过独立分支处理。

Result: 在单模态下游任务中刷新基准性能，多模态任务中有效解决噪声、个体差异和设备失配问题，综合表现超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 小波基架构为多样化生理信号分析奠定基础，多模态设计为可穿戴健康监测、临床诊断等生物医学应用提供了新一代处理范式。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出历史感知神经算子（HANO），通过自回归模型和分层自注意力机制，有效建模路径依赖非弹性材料，克服传统RNN的自洽性问题，并在多场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于循环神经网络（RNN）的模型在处理路径依赖材料时存在自洽性问题和初始状态敏感性，需开发更鲁棒的数据驱动方法以捕捉复杂加载路径下的不可逆演化。

Method: 构建基于傅里叶神经算子的HANO模型，无需隐状态变量，通过自回归预测应变-应力历史短片段，并嵌入分层自注意力机制实现多尺度特征提取和离散不变性。

Result: 在弹塑性硬化和脆性材料渐进各向异性损伤的基准测试中，HANO在预测精度、泛化性和鲁棒性上均优于基线模型，尤其适应不规则采样、噪声及多周期加载等复杂条件。

Conclusion: HANO为路径依赖非弹性材料提供了高效数据驱动替代模型，其自洽性、稳定性和灵活性使其易于与传统数值求解器集成，适用于广泛工程场景。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA通过任务结构探索和参数优化机制，为大型预训练模型的持续学习提供了高效解决方案，平衡了计算效率与知识保留能力。

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: 研究提出PropInfer基准任务，揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）在领域微调时可能泄露敏感数据集属性，并通过两种攻击方法验证其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未明确属性推断攻击是否适用于LLMs，而领域微调数据常包含敏感属性（如医疗数据中的疾病分布），需评估其隐私泄露风险。

Method: 基于ChatDoctor数据集构建PropInfer基准，涵盖多属性类型与任务配置，并提出基于提示生成的攻击和利用词频特征的影子模型攻击。

Result: 实验表明，两种攻击方法在多种预训练LLMs中均成功推断出敏感属性，首次揭示了LLMs在此类攻击下的潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: LLMs在领域微调过程中存在泄露数据集级敏感属性的风险，需开发针对性防御机制以应对这一新型隐私威胁。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 控制基础模型变体对揭示潜在能力因果关系至关重要，因果结构分析可提供超越简单排名的科学洞见。

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced

yet not considered by generic approaches. We introduce EQA-RM, a novel
generative multimodal reward model specifically architected for EQA, trained
via our innovative Contrastive Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)
strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple

granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce
EQARewardBench, a new benchmark built on OpenEQA for standardized EQA reward

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Conclusion: Time-IMM和IMM-TSF为真实场景下的时间序列分析提供了数据基础和工具支持，公开数据集与代码库将推动该领域研究。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合谱聚类与条件拉丁超立方采样（cLHS）的混合方法，以提升土壤有机碳（SOC）监测中采样点的代表性，解决传统cLHS可能忽略重要小集群的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统cLHS在环境协变量选择采样点时可能遗漏少数但关键的环境集群，导致样本代表性不足，影响后续机器学习模型的预测准确性。

Method: 通过谱聚类将研究区域划分为K个同质环境区域，再在每个区域内应用cLHS采样，确保覆盖所有环境条件的多样性。

Result: 在真实SOC数据集上验证表明，混合方法比标准cLHS在协变量特征空间和空间异质性上覆盖更均匀。

Conclusion: 该混合采样设计通过提供更平衡的训练数据，可提高SOC预测精度，为机器学习模型优化奠定基础。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of

Method: 使用仿真数据训练KANs近似状态导数，构建可解释状态空间模型，通过数值实验验证模型一致性，并检测系统参数变化。

Result: KANs能准确识别系统动态方程，验证模型预测与实际动态的一致性（误差<1%），并成功检测到系统参数变化（如电感值±20%波动）。

Conclusion: KANs为电力电子系统提供了一种兼具高精度与物理可解释性的建模框架，其参数敏感性分析能力对工业系统健康监测具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability
for system identification in modern industrial systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a variety of tasks. However, their substantial scale leads to significant
computational resource consumption during inference, resulting in high costs.
Consequently, edge device inference presents a promising solution. The primary
challenges of edge inference include memory usage and inference speed. This
paper introduces MNN-LLM, a framework specifically designed to accelerate the
deployment of large language models on mobile devices. MNN-LLM addresses the
runtime characteristics of LLMs through model quantization and DRAM-Flash
hybrid storage, effectively reducing memory usage. It rearranges weights and
inputs based on mobile CPU instruction sets and GPU characteristics while
employing strategies such as multicore load balancing, mixed-precision
floating-point operations, and geometric computations to enhance performance.
Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key

compared to several strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional
generation.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of machine learning models in
forecasting electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) prices using short historical
training windows, with a focus on detecting seasonal trends and price spikes.
We evaluate four models, namely LSTM with Feed Forward Error Correction (FFEC),
XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, across three European energy markets (Greece,
Belgium, Ireland) using feature sets derived from ENTSO-E forecast data.
Training window lengths range from 7 to 90 days, allowing assessment of model

LightGBM consistently achieves the highest forecasting accuracy and robustness,
particularly with 45 and 60 day training windows, which balance temporal
relevance and learning depth. Furthermore, LightGBM demonstrates superior
detection of seasonal effects and peak price events compared to LSTM and other

combined with boosting methods, can effectively support DAM forecasting in
volatile, data-scarce environments.

Conclusion: 基于GNN的自动化PCB优化方案能高效替代人工流程，提升电路可靠性并减少电子废弃物，具有实际工程应用潜力。

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于假设检验的自适应统计框架，结合频率学派与贝叶斯方法，解决算法公平性评估中样本量差异导致的统计不可靠问题。

Method: 混合方法：(i) 对大子群体证明统计奇偶差异的中心极限定理，构建Wald检验；(ii) 对小子群体开发狄利克雷-多项式贝叶斯估计器，通过蒙特卡洛可信区间实现样本自适应校准。

Result: 在基准数据集验证显示：检验方法能根据数据可获得性自动调整，Wald检验控制I类错误率α，贝叶斯区间随数据量增加自然收敛至Wald区间，提供跨样本规模的统一统计决策。

Conclusion: 该框架将公平性评估转化为基于证据的统计决策，解决了交叉分析中粒度-可靠性权衡问题，为不同规模子群体提供可解释、统计严谨的歧视检测方案。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于mixability的非稳态在线学习方法，通过指数权重与固定分享更新，显著改进了动态遗憾上界，简化了分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态遗憾最小化研究主要针对凸函数，对强曲率损失函数（如平方损失、逻辑损失）的探索不足。需利用mixability更有效地捕捉损失曲率特性。

Method: 采用指数权重方法结合固定分享更新，构建基于mixability的分析框架，避免传统KKT条件分析的复杂性。

Result: 动态遗憾上界从Baby和Wang的$\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$改进至$\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$，显著降低维度依赖。

Conclusion: 通过mixability统一分析框架，在提升动态遗憾性能的同时简化理论推导，为非稳态环境下强曲率损失优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

Result: U-Net分割IoU达0.87。非重叠信号MSE 0.0010(rho=0.9644)，重叠信号MSE 0.0029(rho=0.9641)，均显著优于基线(非重叠MSE 0.0015/rho 0.9366，重叠MSE 0.0178/rho 0.8676)。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升信号重叠场景下的心电图数字化精度，为临床与研究提供可靠解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Conclusion: 低秩分解结合黎曼优化的图学习框架成功解决高维扩展性问题，为大规模图结构推断提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MISL方法虽通过最大化状态与技能互信息学习通用技能，但缺乏对技能多样性与可分离性的理论分析，无法保证其在下游任务策略初始化中的有效性。

Method: 提出解缠指标LSEPIN，建立其与下游任务适应成本的信息几何关联；用Wasserstein距离替代KL散度，设计WSEP目标函数及PWSEP算法，优化技能几何特性。

Result: 理论证明WSEP能提升下游任务适应效率，相比MISL发现更多初始策略；PWSEP可覆盖所有最优初始策略，具有更强理论保证。

Conclusion: 通过引入几何分析与Wasserstein距离，本文方法弥补了MISL的理论缺陷，为无监督强化学习的技能学习提供了更优的多样性与可分离性保障。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法依赖快速思考模式（直接映射历史模式至未来值），缺乏显式中间推理；而基于提示工程的LLMs存在高计算成本、隐私风险及领域深度推理能力不足的问题。需训练LLMs发展慢思考能力以提升时间序列推理。

Method: Time-R1框架分为两阶段：1）监督微调实现模型预热适配；2）强化学习提升泛化能力，设计细粒度多目标奖励，并引入GRIP（基于非均匀采样的组相对重要性策略优化）鼓励模型有效推理路径探索。

Result: 实验表明，Time-R1在多样化数据集上显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习与多目标奖励设计，Time-R1成功增强LLMs的时间序列推理能力，为慢思考范式在时间序列预测中的应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型潜在空间的复杂结构及其与相变现象的联系提供了新视角，揭示了生成模型几何特性与物理系统行为的深层关联。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 现有关于CoT有效性的研究依赖理想假设（训练/测试分布一致、无噪声数据），但现实数据常存在分布偏移和污染。本文首次系统研究此类数据偏移对CoT模型性能的具体危害。

Method: 以k-parity问题为对象，分析数据分布偏移与数据投毒的联合影响，采用标准CoT分解方法训练模型，对比直接预测与CoT策略的表现差异。

Result: 发现CoT在数据偏移场景下性能显著劣于直接预测，并通过理论分析揭示了模型内部机制对此类数据扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: CoT在非理想数据条件下的脆弱性被实证，强调实际应用中需严格评估数据质量与分布稳定性，并需重新审视CoT在复杂场景中的适用边界。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE提出一种通过斜投影同时移除敏感概念并保留标签协方差的方法，在理论保证下最小化嵌入失真，实验显示其在多个基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法在去除神经网络中不相关概念时易损害有效信号，导致公平性与可解释性问题，需开发更优的去除机制。

Method: 采用斜投影技术(oblique projection)『剪除』敏感方向，通过SPLICE算法实现线性概念移除与协方差保护，理论证明其为满足条件的最小失真唯一解。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE在去除受保护属性的同时，对主任务信息的破坏显著低于基线方法。

Conclusion: SPLICE通过数学严谨的投影机制，在概念移除与信息保留间取得平衡，为提升模型公平性提供了理论可靠且实践有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

*Marco Spinaci,Marek Polewczyk,Maximilian Schambach,Sam Thelin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ConTextTab模型，结合表格原生框架的语义理解与大规模真实数据训练，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA水平，并在CARTE基准上创下新标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格上下文学习模型存在局限性：表格原生模型（如TabPFN）仅依赖合成数据，无法利用真实数据语义；基于大语言模型的方案（如TabuLa-8B）虽具备语义理解能力，但受架构限制难以处理大量信息。需要融合两者的优势。

Method: 通过多模态专用嵌入技术，在表格原生框架中整合语义对齐能力，并利用大规模真实表格数据进行训练，构建ConTextTab模型。

Result: 模型在广泛基准测试中与SOTA方法竞争，并在富含语义的CARTE基准上建立新性能标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功融合了表格原生架构的高效性与大语言模型的语义理解能力，通过真实数据训练实现了性能突破。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文提出Neural方法，在BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA临床问答任务中获亚军。通过分阶段证据检索与答案生成，结合提示优化与自洽投票，显著超越零样本/少样本基线，证明数据驱动提示优化可替代模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)的自动化问答需在有限监督下实现精准证据检索与可靠答案生成，以弥合临床信息鸿沟。现有方法在监督成本与结果可信度上面临挑战。

Method: 1) 分两阶段处理：句子级证据识别+带引用的答案生成；2) 使用DSPy的MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，联合优化指令与少样本示例；3) 引入自洽投票提升证据召回率。

Result: 在隐藏测试集上获得51.5总分(第二名)，较零样本/少样本基线分别提升20+和10+分。证据召回率提升且精度未受损。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是高风险临床QA任务中模型微调的高效替代方案，通过可解释的引用机制增强了医疗AI助手的可靠性。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出FGN模型，通过模型扰动生成集合预报，直接优化CRPS指标，在准确性和概率预测上超越现有方法，并实现热带气旋路径预测及空间结构捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）在速度和精度上存在局限，而现有机器学习模型虽表现优异，但需进一步优化集合预测能力与概率评分。

Method: FGN通过约束模型集合生成扰动预测，直接以最小化连续秩概率评分（CRPS）为目标进行训练，仅依赖边缘分布数据即可建模空间关联。

Result: FGN在确定性与概率指标上均达SOTA，可预测热带气旋路径，并有效捕捉联合空间结构（尽管训练未使用此类数据）。

Conclusion: FGN证明了简单、可扩展的机器学习方法在天气预测中的潜力，其集合生成策略与CRPS优化框架为概率天气预报提供了新范式。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了在单调分类问题中，以相对误差因子(1+ε)逼近最优分类器时所需的最小标签查询成本，提出了近乎匹配的上下界结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能保证分类器误差不超过最优解的绝对数值，而实际应用中允许相对误差的需求更普遍。本文旨在建立相对误差框架下的理论分析基础。

Method: 通过构造自适应查询策略，在保持分类器单调性的约束下，选择性地揭示关键点标签以逼近最优误差。采用组合分析与几何方法推导查询复杂度。

Result: 针对任意ε≥0，给出了误差至多(1+ε)k*时查询成本的紧致上下界，证明二者在多项式因子内匹配，覆盖了所有可能的近似程度场景。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了相对误差框架下单调分类问题的理论空白，所建立的查询复杂度边界为设计高效主动学习算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

*Benjamin Hoover,Zhaoyang Shi,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Dmitry Krotov,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Epanechnikov核的log-sum-ReLU（LSR）能量函数，用于密集关联记忆网络，实现了无需指数分离函数的精确记忆检索，并引入具有创造性的新局部极小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆网络常使用log-sum-exponential（LSE）函数，但其需要指数分离函数且局部极小值有限。本文旨在通过更优的核密度估计方法改进能量函数，以提升存储容量和生成潜力。

Method: 提出LSR能量函数，基于Epanechnikov核替代传统LSE，通过理论分析证明其指数容量特性，并在图像数据集上验证其局部极小值的涌现特性。

Result: 实验表明LSR比LSE模型拥有更多局部极小值（记忆点），且保持模式恢复能力。其涌现记忆在图像数据中表现出创造性和新颖性，暗示生成任务潜力。

Conclusion: LSR能量函数在保持精确记忆恢复的同时，兼具大规模存储和生成能力，为密集关联记忆网络开辟了新的应用方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用基于合成数据训练的激活探针检测大语言模型高风险交互，其性能与中等规模LLM监控器相当，但计算成本降低百万倍，并支持构建分层监控系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全部署大语言模型需监控高风险交互，但现有研究对此关注不足。激活探针作为一种高效监测手段，其潜力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 通过合成数据训练多种激活探针架构，评估其在真实场景中的跨分布泛化能力，并与提示工程/微调的中等规模LLM监控器进行性能及计算效率对比。

Result: 探针在真实数据上表现与中等LLM监控器相当，计算资源节省10^6倍。实验证明其适用于构建以探针为初筛、LLM为精细分析的资源感知型分层监控系统。

Conclusion: 激活探针是高效检测高风险交互的可行方案，其低计算开销特性为构建分级监控框架提供基础。开源合成数据集与代码以推动后续研究。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态深度学习系统（DDLS）通过动态调整推理计算提升效率，但其动态行为引入了新的攻击面（如效率对抗攻击），可能严重降低系统性能，需系统性分析其安全漏洞。

Method: 提出首个基于三类动态行为（动态计算量、动态推理迭代、动态输出生成）的效率攻击分类法，并通过深入评估攻击策略及现有防御机制，揭示其安全挑战。

Result: 现有防御机制对效率攻击效果有限，尤其在动态计算和输出生成场景中表现不足，需开发针对性更强的缓解策略以应对新兴攻击。

Conclusion: 动态深度学习系统的效率攻击威胁显著，当前防御措施无法有效应对，未来需设计新型安全机制以保障自适应系统的可靠部署。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在未知干扰下难以保证策略对状态约束的鲁棒性，需探索如何通过模型无关方法实现安全约束的可靠满足。

Method: 分析熵正则化与约束惩罚的交互机制，将严格安全约束松弛为惩罚项，将约束RL问题转化为标准无约束RL问题，利用常规模型无关算法求解。

Result: 熵正则化通过增加未来可行行动选择提升抗动作噪声能力，约束松弛方法在保持安全性和最优性的同时显著增强对干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒安全性的内在关联为强化学习安全机制研究提供了新方向，通过简单奖励塑形即可实现抗干扰的安全策略。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在处理有限分类器混合时缺乏理论支持且效果有限，需设计一种基于几何分析、满足有效性及最大性要求的攻击方法。

Method: 通过几何分析定义攻击的有效性与最大性，提出具有理论保证的二元线性环境攻击方法——格点攀爬攻击（lattice climber attack）。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上的实验表明，新攻击优于现有方法，且在二元线性场景中满足理论性质。

Conclusion: 格点攀爬攻击在理论与实验层面均优于传统方法，为有限分类器混合模型的对抗鲁棒性评估提供了更优解。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一状态离散扩散模型虽具备自纠正能力，但其性能长期落后于自回归模型和掩码扩散模型。本文发现离散扩散过程与高斯扩散存在内在关联，旨在通过迁移连续域技术突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 1. 基于高斯过程设计课程学习策略，通过降低方差使训练速度翻倍；2. 提出离散一致性蒸馏算法，将连续域的一致性采样技术适配到离散空间，实现少步生成。

Result: 课程学习使模型在7个基准中的3个上零样本困惑度超越自回归模型；一致性蒸馏使采样速度提升两个数量级，代码与模型已开源。

Conclusion: 通过建立离散-连续扩散的桥梁，Duo有效缩小了扩散模型与主流方法的性能差距，为实用化扩散语言模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 提出NoLoCo优化方法，通过改进Nesterov动量实现隐式参数同步，无需集体通信，显著降低大模型训练中的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模语言模型训练依赖高带宽集群，扩展成本高。现有低通信方法仍需全局参数同步，在低带宽网络中效率低下。

Method: 基于Nesterov动量优化器改进，通过随机选择模型副本进行部分权重平均，避免显式全局同步，消除集体通信需求。

Result: 在125M-6.8B参数模型上，通信开销显著低于全分片数据并行和DiLoCo方法，同步速度提升10倍，收敛速度加快4%。

Conclusion: NoLoCo通过去中心化隐式同步机制，在低带宽环境下实现高效分布式训练，兼具通信效率与收敛速度优势。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推断方法存在局限性，而基于先验数据拟合网络(PFNs)的表格基础模型尚未被系统应用于因果推断场景。需要构建符合因果推断理论要求的贝叶斯先验，并开发统一框架来支持多种因果调整方法。

Conclusion: CausalFM为训练因果推断基础模型提供了通用框架，可能革新医学/经济学等领域的因果分析范式，其贝叶斯推理能力通过符合理论要求的先验设计得以保证。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other

### [165] [Sequential-Parallel Duality in Prefix Scannable Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10918)
*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出前缀可扫描模型（PSMs），统一了多种支持并行训练与高效序列推理的神经序列模型，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时匹配状态空间模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经序列模型（如GLA、Mamba）虽实现并行训练与序列推理的平衡，但缺乏对支持此类特性的模型类别的形式化定义。需构建统一框架以涵盖更多架构并探索新模型潜力。

Method: 1. 定义状态空间模型为可用并行前缀扫描算法更新的模型；2. 扩展为更通用的PSMs，允许非关联操作符（如softmax注意力）；3. 通过小规模语言建模和合成任务进行实证评估。

Result: PSMs在保持Transformer表达能力的同时，达到与状态空间模型相当的推理效率（O(1)计算/词元，log(N)内存），部分任务中长度泛化能力优于两者。

Conclusion: PSMs通过放宽状态聚合操作符的约束，统一了多种序列模型架构，为设计高效且表达力强的序列模型提供了理论框架与实证支持。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

### [166] [Robustly Improving LLM Fairness in Realistic Settings via Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10922)
*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现现有反偏见提示在真实招聘场景中失效，提出通过内部激活方向修正实现稳健去偏，主流LLM在现实上下文下仍存在显著偏见，但偏向黑人和女性候选人，新方法能将偏差控制在2.5%以内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在招聘决策中的高风险应用需要解决潜在偏见问题，现有简单反偏见提示在真实复杂场景中效果不足，需开发更可靠的去偏方法。

Method: 通过识别模型激活中的敏感属性相关方向，在推理时应用仿射概念编辑进行内部偏见缓解，使用合成数据集提取方向但能泛化到真实场景。

Result: 在GPT-4o等主流模型测试中，现实上下文导致最高12%的偏见差异，新方法将偏差稳定降至1%以下，所有场景偏差均低于2.5%且保持模型性能。

Conclusion: LLM招聘系统需采用更现实的评估方法，并实施内部激活层面的偏见缓解策略，才能实现公平决策。概念编辑方法展现强泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SEAL框架，使大语言模型能通过生成微调数据和更新指令自我调整权重，实现持续适应新任务表现提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）虽强大但静态，缺乏根据新任务、知识或示例动态调整权重的机制。

Method: SEAL框架通过模型生成自我编辑数据（如信息重组、超参指定、工具调用），结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习循环（以下游性能为奖励信号）实现自我适应。

Result: 在知识整合和少样本泛化任务中，SEAL展现出模型自我调整的潜力，且无需依赖独立适配器或辅助网络。

Conclusion: SEAL为语言模型实现自我导向适应提供了可行路径，实验验证了其作为持续权重更新框架的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

### [169] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出GUARD框架，通过数据归因指标动态分配遗忘权重，减少大语言模型（LLM）遗忘特定数据时的非预期信息损失，在保持遗忘效果的同时显著提升保留性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法因忽视数据层面因素，在移除高影响力数据时易造成模型效用下降和有用信息丢失。需探索数据归因对遗忘性能的影响以解决此问题。

Method: GUARD提出轻量级代理数据归因指标，量化遗忘集与保留集的“对齐”程度，并基于此设计自适应非均匀权重分配目标，通过动态调整遗忘权重减少保留信息损失。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，GUARD将保留集的Truth Ratio效用损失降低达194.92%（遗忘10%数据时），且遗忘指标与现有方法相当，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因驱动的动态权重分配机制，有效平衡LLM的遗忘需求与知识保留，为解决非预期遗忘问题提供了理论保障和实用框架。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EG-CFG方法，在代码生成过程中动态整合执行信号，通过逐行反馈和多阶段处理提升生成效果，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLM）在代码生成时未利用执行反馈，而人类程序员依赖此类信号。需在推理阶段引入实时执行反馈以提升生成代码的可执行性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）波束搜索生成候选代码行；2）通过测试用例执行提取执行信号；3）将信号动态嵌入生成过程。通过行内信号一致性保持语法结构，并支持多代理并行探索不同推理路径。

Result: EG-CFG在多样化编码任务中显著优于基准方法，从基础问题到复杂竞赛编程任务均达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过动态执行信号引导和并行探索机制，有效提升代码生成质量，验证了执行反馈在生成式编程中的关键作用。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有网页代理方法因需适应人类设计的界面（如处理复杂DOM树、依赖截图或API）存在效率与可靠性问题，需开发更适配代理能力的新交互模式。

Method: 提出『代理导向网页界面』（AWI）概念并制定六项设计原则，强调安全性、效率与标准化，以协调多方利益并优化代理操作。

Result: AWI框架为网页代理设计提供新方向，通过界面范式革新克服现有限制，促进高效、透明且可靠的代理开发，需机器学习社区协作实现。

Conclusion: 转向代理专用界面（AWI）是解决人机交互不匹配的关键，其标准化原则将推动网页代理技术突破，实现更广泛自动化应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ReGuidance方法，通过反向运行无条件概率流ODE并结合扩散后验采样（DPS），提升低信噪比逆问题中样本的真实性与奖励一致性，解决现有方法偏离数据流形的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的逆问题求解方法（如DPS）在低信噪比场景下易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。需一种机制在保持算法灵活性的同时增强样本质量与测量一致性。

Method: 提出ReGuidance框架：对用户算法生成的候选解，反向运行无条件概率流ODE得到潜在变量，再将其作为DPS的初始化，通过迭代优化同时提升奖励与数据流形逼近。

Result: 实验表明，在大型区域修复和高倍超分辨率任务中，ReGuidance显著优于现有方法，理论证明其在多模态数据分布下可同时提升奖励与流形逼近度，首次为DPS提供严格算法保证。

Conclusion: ReGuidance通过潜在空间初始化策略有效平衡奖励优化与数据流形约束，为扩散模型在复杂逆问题中的应用提供了可靠解决方案，并建立了理论支撑。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论角度研究了基于流形的Hölder函数回归的上下文学习（ICL），通过连接注意力机制与核方法，揭示了Transformer在几何数据上的泛化误差与流形内在维度的指数关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在自然语言和视觉领域表现优异，但其在结构化几何数据中的理论机制尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究流形上非线性模型ICL的理论基础。

Method: 建立注意力机制与经典核方法之间的理论联系，通过分析提示长度和训练任务数量对泛化误差的影响，推导Hölder函数在流形上的回归误差边界。

Result: 当训练任务充足时，Transformer达到流形上Hölder函数的极小极大回归率，其误差随流形内在维度（而非环境维度）指数变化，并量化了任务数量对误差的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了流形几何结构对ICL的关键作用，为分析非线性模型上下文学习提供了新工具，同时阐明了Transformer作为算法学习器的复杂度特性。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型成本极高，小规模实验结论难以迁移至生产系统，阻碍高效创新。现有缩放定律预测精度不足，需改进以弥合扩展鸿沟。

Method: 系统构建模型损失曲面L(N,D)，提出Farseer缩放定律。通过训练约1000个不同规模的LLM（消耗300万H100 GPU小时），验证方法有效性，并开源所有模型、日志及数据。

Result: Farseer外推误差较Chinchilla降低433%，能可靠评估全(N,D)配置下的训练策略，揭示更优算力分配方式。开源资源覆盖多规模模型与实验数据。

Conclusion: Farseer填补了扩展实验的预测空白，使小规模消融研究可外推至大模型性能预测，并通过开源促进LLM扩展规律的进一步研究。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at
https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 本文分析扩散桥中Log Variance（LV）损失与反向KL（rKL）损失的差异，提出使用对数导数技巧的rKL损失（rKL-LD）在理论和实验上均优于LV损失，且训练更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，在扩散桥或扩散系数可学习时，LV损失与rKL损失的梯度等价性失效，且LV损失无法通过数据处理不等式等理论合理推导，需探索更优的优化目标。

Method: 通过理论分析对比LV损失与rKL损失的梯度差异，提出采用对数导数技巧的rKL-LD损失，避免LV损失的理论缺陷，并在多种扩散桥模型中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，在多个挑战性基准任务中，使用rKL-LD损失的扩散桥采样器性能优于LV损失，且训练过程更稳定、超参数调整更少。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失不仅解决了LV损失的理论问题，还显著提升了采样器性能，成为扩散桥方法中更优的损失函数选择。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决CBPV在π演算中的编码问题，规避de Bruijn索引的形式化挑战，并通过bisimulation一致性验证编码的正确性。

Method: 采用内部π演算（pi-i-calculus）简化形式化，手工证明可靠性与完备性，验证Gorla标准，对比Milner编码，并启动Coq形式化（部分引理依赖手工证明）。

Result: 成功定义CBPV到pi-i-calculus的编码，证明其可靠且完备，满足Gorla五准则，扩展至异步多元π演算与本地π演算，并初步完成Coq形式化框架。

Conclusion: 提出的编码方法有效解决了CBPV与π演算的互操作性，形式化验证为后续研究奠定基础，未完全证明的引理通过手工论证保持合理性。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

*Xiaolin Hu,Qinghua Zhou,Bogdan Grechuk,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出StepProof方法，通过将自然语言证明分解为可逐句验证的子证明，显著提升自动形式化的成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式定理证明器（ITPs）缺乏自然语言接口，且传统自动形式化方法仅支持完整证明的验证，无法实现细粒度的句子级验证。

Method: StepProof通过将完整证明拆分为多个可独立验证的子证明，实现句子级自动形式化验证，并允许人工微调自然语言证明以优化性能。

Result: 实验表明StepProof在验证成功率和效率上优于传统方法，且人工微调后的自然语言证明可进一步提升其表现。

Conclusion: StepProof通过分步验证机制有效解决了自动形式化的细粒度验证问题，为自然语言与形式化证明的衔接提供了新路径。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合多尺度控制变量和结构/渐近保持神经网络(SAPNNs)的方法，用于加速高维随机动力学方程的不确定性量化，在保持物理一致性的同时显著提升蒙特卡洛采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蒙特卡洛方法在高维参数空间下存在收敛速度慢、方差大的问题，且难以保持物理规律。需要开发既能提升计算效率又能保持物理特性的新方法。

Method: 采用多尺度控制变量策略利用低精度模型降方差，并设计SAPNNs神经网络强制满足正性/守恒律/熵耗散等物理约束，通过低精度预训练+精选高精度样本微调实现物理一致性。

Result: 在均质/非均质多尺度场景中验证，相比标准蒙特卡洛方法显著提升计算效率(最高达10倍)并保持渐近精度，同时确保解的正性等基本物理特性。

Conclusion: 所提出的SAPNNs框架成功解决了高维动力学方程UQ中效率与物理保真度的平衡问题，为大规模多尺度预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

TL;DR: 本文研究了高维噪声数据下单纯形学习的样本复杂度，提出了基于样本压缩和傅里叶方法的新算法，并建立了信息论下界，解决了信噪比足够高时复杂度与无噪声情况一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据中噪声对单纯形学习的影响尚未被充分研究，现有方法在噪声场景下的样本复杂度界限不明确。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，特别是当信噪比(SNR)变化时复杂度界限的变化规律。

Method: 结合样本压缩技术(Ashtiani et al., 2018)与新型傅里叶分析方法，提出从噪声观测中恢复分布的通用框架，扩展了先前工作(saberi2023sample)的信息论分析工具。

Result: 1. 上界：样本量n≥(K²/ε²)e^O(K/SNR²)时可实现ℓ₂/TV距离ε估计
2. 下界：噪声场景需n≥Ω(K³σ²/ε² + K/ε)
3. 当SNR≥Ω(K^½)时噪声与无噪声复杂度一致
4. 无噪声下界Ω(K/ε)与已知上界匹配

Conclusion: 首次证明高信噪比下噪声场景复杂度与无噪声情况等价，提出的傅里叶方法为分布恢复提供了新工具。理论结果解决了关于噪声单纯形学习复杂度的开放性问题，框架可扩展至更广泛的分布学习问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为3MSBM的新框架，通过多边际条件随机最优控制问题学习随机系统的平滑测值样条，解决了现有方法在捕捉长程时间依赖性和轨迹一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相邻快照成对插值的方法难以捕捉复杂系统（如单细胞生物学、气象学）的长程时间依赖性，导致推断轨迹的连贯性受限。

Method: 提出动量多边际薛定谔桥匹配（3MSBM），将动态提升至相空间，通过多边际条件桥路径最小化变分目标，学习保持中间边际的传输映射。

Result: 实验表明，3MSBM在真实场景中显著优于现有方法，能有效捕捉时间依赖性复杂动态，并提升收敛性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际设置下的匹配框架训练开辟了新方向，解决了长程依赖与轨迹一致性问题，推动了复杂系统推断的进展。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

Motivation: 现有研究试图通过平滑分析等框架连接对抗性与随机在线学习场景，但缺乏对一般分布类约束下学习能力的细粒度分析。本文旨在探索分布约束对手的通用框架，揭示函数类与分布约束间的相互作用对可学习性的影响。

Method: 采用分布约束对手框架，通过约束对手选择实例的分布类别，分析对抗环境（包括非适应与自适应对手）下的可学习性条件，重点研究函数类（如线性分类器）与分布约束的交互机制。

Result: 建立了分布类可学习性的理论表征，统一并扩展了现有平滑分析结果，证明线性分类器等函数类无需预知分布约束即可同时对抗所有可学习分布类中的对手。

Conclusion: 该框架为对抗-随机连续谱提供了统一分析工具，揭示了分布约束与函数类结构共同决定学习边界的机制，为无先验知识下的鲁棒学习奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Motivation: 扩散模型反向过程中语义与结构特征分阶段涌现的现象与物理相变类似，但缺乏量化分析语义决策时间定位的方法。

Method: 基于贝叶斯最优分类器的在线公式，计算含噪状态下的条件熵，通过条件熵时间导数确定类别标签与噪声状态间最大信息传递时段。

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上验证显示：语义信息传递峰值出现在扩散中期，且不同类别的熵率分布存在显著时间差异。

Conclusion: 扩散生成过程中，不同类别的语义决策具有时间定位特性，该发现为理解生成模型的语义编码机制提供了量化依据。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于盒约束的Softmax函数（BCSoftmax），通过显式约束输出概率的上下界，解决了传统Softmax无法施加硬约束的问题，并开发了高效计算算法及后处理校准方法，有效提升了模型校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax函数通过温度参数实现软控制，但无法对输出概率施加硬约束（如上下界限制），这在需要高可靠性模型的应用中存在局限性。

Method: 提出BCSoftmax函数作为Softmax的泛化形式，通过带盒约束的优化问题建模，开发精确高效的计算算法，并设计两种后处理校准方法以调整概率或logits的上下界。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上的实验表明，所提方法显著改善了校准指标，缓解了预测模型的欠自信和过自信问题。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax通过硬性约束输出概率范围增强了模型可靠性，后处理校准方法可有效提升下游决策的可信度，实验结果验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离策略学习依赖静态行为策略收集的数据，缺乏灵活性。研究旨在通过自适应策略迭代优化与数据收集，提升学习效率与数据质量。

Method: 扩展静态场景中PAC-Bayesian对数平滑(LS)框架至自适应场景，结合在线PAC-Bayesian理论工具，调整LS估计器以支持多轮策略部署。

Result: 方法在静态场景中与主流离线方法性能相当，在允许中间策略部署时显著优于后者；温和条件下收敛速度更快，多场景实验验证了自适应数据收集优势。

Conclusion: 自适应策略部署与PAC-Bayesian框架的结合有效提升了离策略学习效率，为动态环境下的强化学习提供了理论支持与实践方案。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Motivation: 传统A/B测试使用的均值差异估计器虽无偏但存在高方差问题，当被比较系统具有相似性时存在优化空间。

Method: 引入基于无偏离策略估计器的新方法，通过构建估计器家族并筛选出最小方差估计量，保持无偏性的同时降低估计波动。

Result: 理论证明与实验表明，新估计器在系统相似场景下实现显著降低方差(最高达10倍)，且计算复杂度与标准方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的最小方差估计器为A/B测试提供更高效的评估工具，特别适用于对比相似系统的场景，具有理论保障和实用价值。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果推断中，隐藏混淆因素会干扰效应估计的准确性。传统方法依赖强假设，而基于工具变量的方法需应对非参数化场景下的挑战。论文旨在通过谱特征分析，解决工具变量在复杂条件下的有效性问题。

Method: 提出一种基于谱特征的非参数工具变量回归方法，利用处理变量与工具变量间算子的顶部特征子空间构建特征，推导两阶段最小二乘估计器的泛化误差边界，并分析其性能与失败模式。

Result: 实验表明，方法性能分为三类：1）『好』场景（强谱对齐+慢特征值衰减）效果最优；2）『坏』场景（强谱对齐+快衰减）需更多样本；3）『糟糕』场景（弱谱对齐）无论特征值如何均失效。

Conclusion: 谱对齐强度与工具变量算子的特征值衰减速度共同决定方法成败。强谱对齐与慢衰减（强工具变量）为理想条件，而弱对齐或快衰减可能导致性能下降或完全失效。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分类器无关指导在离散扩散模型中的作用机制，特别是指导强度如何影响采样行为、输出分布结构以及动态轨迹的收敛特性。

Method: 在假设无评分误差和离散化误差的前提下，推导引导反向动力学的显式解析解，并通过理论分析和实验验证指导强度对协方差结构、总变差衰减率的影响。

Result: 指导强度w会放大目标类特定区域并抑制共享区域，1D/2D场景呈现定量差异；大w时总变差衰减率呈双指数下降，指导同时控制输出分布和采样轨迹动态。

Conclusion: 分类器无关指导不仅通过调整概率分布实现类别控制，还通过改变反向动态的收敛速度直接影响采样过程，其几何效应和维度敏感性为模型设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

### [192] [Prediction of steady states in a marine ecosystem model by a machine learning technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10475)
*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）预测海洋生态模型稳态初始值，显著减少spin-up计算时间，节省50-95%迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋生态模型通过spin-up计算稳态年周期耗时较长，需寻找高效方法减少计算时间。

Method: 基于预计算的稳态数据，利用带质量校正的CVAE建立参数到三维稳态年周期的映射，并将预测结果作为spin-up初始值。

Result: CVAE预测的spin-up初始值使迭代次数减少50-95%，优于传统均匀初始值及训练数据均值初始值。

Conclusion: CVAE生成的初始值可大幅加速模型收敛，但预测结果的年周期性精度仍需通过spin-up进一步优化。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM的新框架，通过优化初始条件生成极端热浪情景，应用于2021年太平洋西北热浪事件，模拟出比传统方法更极端的温度异常，验证了该方法在极端天气风险评估中的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于物理模型的大规模集成方法计算成本高，且难以准确模拟罕见极端天气事件，亟需开发高效、高保真的方法以评估气候变暖下的极端天气风险上限。

Method: 利用可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM，通过优化初始条件生成物理自洽的最坏情况热浪轨迹，结合大气阻塞和罗斯贝波动态特征分析。

Result: 在2021年热浪案例中，模型生成温度异常较75成员集成极端值高3.7°C，揭示出强化的大气阻塞和放大的罗斯贝波型态等关键机制。

Conclusion: 可微分气候模型为探索极端天气事件可能性上限提供了高效新范式，支持构建气候变化背景下针对性极端情景推演。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

TL;DR: 研究多尺度损失函数在概率机器学习天气预测模型中的影响，验证其能有效提升小尺度变率约束且不影响预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习天气预测模型在优化连续排序概率得分（CRPS）时，对小尺度气象变化的约束不足，需探索多尺度损失以改进。

Method: 在ECMWF开发的AIFS-CRPS模型中引入多尺度损失函数，通过直接优化近似公平连续排序概率得分（afCRPS）进行训练。

Result: 多尺度损失显著增强了小尺度气象变率的约束，同时未降低整体预报准确性，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多尺度损失为天气预测模型提供了尺度感知训练的新方向，未来可进一步探索其在复杂气象建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

TL;DR: 本文通过计算研究扩展SSH模型，揭示拓扑、准周期无序、非厄米性和Floquet驱动在1D拓扑系统中的复杂相互作用。发现强AAH调制破坏拓扑边缘态，非厄米系统出现趋肤效应，并利用Floquet驱动在平凡链中实现拓扑绝缘体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准SSH模型作为一维拓扑绝缘体典范，其在复杂现实条件(如无序、非厄米性、时变驱动)下的行为尚未完全阐明，需系统性研究其拓扑特性演变机制。

Method: 采用精确对角化与数值求解器分析谱特性与局域化程度(IPR)，结合无监督机器学习(PCA)进行相态分类，研究非厄米趋肤效应与Floquet周期驱动的影响。

Result: 强AAH调制引发局域化相变摧毁拓扑边缘态；非厄米系统出现体态边界局域的趋肤效应；Floquet驱动可在平凡链中产生准能带边界的反常边缘态，实现动态拓扑相。

Conclusion: 广义SSH系统呈现拓扑-无序-非厄米性-驱动多体耦合效应，为设计新型拓扑相提供理论框架，同时揭示机器学习在复杂相分类中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本文通过量子精度的大规模显式反应模拟和深度等变神经网络势，揭示了固态电池中固体电解质界面（SEI）形成过程中的新晶体无序相Li₂S₀.₇₂P₀.₁₄Cl₀.₁₄，并阐明了锂枝晶萌生的关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固态电池中固体电解质界面（SEI）的原子级反应机制尚不明确，实验表征困难且传统模拟方法在速度和精度上存在局限，阻碍了电池性能优化。

Method: 结合主动学习和深度等变神经网络势，进行大规模显式反应模拟；利用基于局部环境聚类的无监督分类技术，自动分析界面反应与互扩散过程。

Result: 发现SEI中热力学未预测的晶体无序相Li₂S₀.₇₂P₀.₁₄Cl₀.₁₄，揭示锂沿界面蠕动的枝晶萌生机理，模拟结果与实验观测一致。

Conclusion: 该无实验参数拟合的第一性原理数字孪生方法，为解析固态电化学中复杂异质过程的原子动力学提供了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的代码质量高度依赖用户输入的提示质量，而用户背景差异可能导致生成结果不稳定。需量化模型对输入的敏感性，以确保不同背景用户均能获得高质量代码。

Method: 提出合成评估流程和基于角色的系统性评估方法，两者均不依赖特定编程任务或大语言模型，具有广泛适用性。

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效暴露大语言模型生成代码的定性差异，并公开相关代码供社区使用。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解不同用户背景下LLM生成代码的差异提供工具，有助于提升代码生成可靠性并促进更包容的代码生成工具开发。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

TL;DR: BugGen利用大语言模型自动生成高质量RTL功能错误数据集，显著提升验证效率和ML辅助调试能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂性增加导致验证资源紧张，现有手动或自动错误插入方法无法可靠生成多样化、可扩展的错误数据集。

Method: 采用多智能体流水线架构，通过闭环代理选择突变目标，结合迭代优化与回滚机制确保语法正确性和功能可检测性。

Conclusion: BugGen为生成高质量错误数据集提供可扩展解决方案，在暴露验证覆盖漏洞和提升ML调试实用性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过大规模分析89.4万条AI移动应用的用户评论，开发多阶段分析流程，揭示用户对AI功能的关注焦点：正面评价集中于生产力与可靠性，负面反馈聚焦技术故障与定价问题，并发现传统方法易忽略的共现情感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI移动应用快速普及，但用户对其功能的评价尚未被系统研究。海量用户反馈难以处理，需开发高效分析工具以深入理解用户体验。

Method: 构建含292个AI应用、14类别的数据集，设计多阶段分析流程（含人工标注基准与LLM验证），通过评论分类、方面-情感提取和聚类三阶段确保分析精度与一致性。

Result: 提取超百万方面-情感对，聚类为18个正面主题（如生产力提升）和15个负面主题（如技术故障）。同一评论中可同时存在正负情感，传统孤立分析方法易遗漏此现象。

Conclusion: 细粒度分析能更真实反映用户体验，揭示通用满意因素（如个性化辅助）与领域特定问题（如语言支持不足），为AI应用优化提供新视角。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory为构建高质量GitHub问题解决数据集提供高效自动化工具，有望加速LLM软件工程能力训练与优化。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation
model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories
by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a
gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual

adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over
temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single

embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach
using autoregressive vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有基于多样性度量的提示引导扩散模型在广泛语义提示下生成样本多样性不足，且传统熵计算方法因O(n³)复杂度难以扩展至大规模生成场景。

Method: 提出可扩展的提示感知Rényi核熵多样性引导(SPARKE)，通过条件熵动态关联相似提示的多样性度量，并将条件潜在RKE评分引导复杂度降至O(n³)→O(n)。

Result: 在多个文生图扩散模型上的实验表明，SPARKE在不显著增加计算成本的前提下，有效提升了生成数据的提示感知多样性。

Conclusion: SPARKE通过线性复杂度实现大规模提示感知多样性引导，为扩散模型的多提示生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ScoreMix，一种基于扩散模型分数组合特性的数据增强方法，通过在扩散采样中混合不同类别的分数生成挑战性样本，有效提升判别器性能，尤其在数据有限时。研究发现，选择判别器嵌入空间中距离较远的类别进行混合效果更佳，且生成器与判别器的特征空间相关性较低。该方法无需复杂调参即显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对标记数据有限场景下判别器性能不足的问题，传统数据增强可能无法生成足够挑战性的样本。本文利用扩散模型的分数组合特性，旨在通过生成更有效的合成数据提升判别器能力。

Method: ScoreMix方法在扩散采样过程中，对不同类别的条件轨迹分数进行凸组合，生成合成样本。通过系统研究类别选择策略，发现判别器嵌入空间中距离较远的类别组合（而非生成器条件空间中的邻近类别）能带来更大性能提升。

Result: 实验表明，ScoreMix在所有基准测试中显著提升判别器性能，且生成器的条件空间与判别器的嵌入空间相关性较低。该方法无需大量参数搜索即实现性能改进，并缓解数据收集难题。

Conclusion: ScoreMix通过扩散模型分数组合生成高挑战性样本，为数据受限场景提供高效解决方案。其核心在于利用判别器嵌入空间的远距离类别混合策略，显著提升模型性能，同时减少对大规模数据集的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型多模态情感识别框架CIDer，通过自蒸馏和因果推理模块解决模态缺失和分布外数据问题，在减少计算复杂度的同时提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态情感识别方法难以同时处理模态缺失和分布外数据，且存在模型依赖性强、参数冗余等局限性，亟需更高效通用的解决方案。

Method: 结合模型特定自蒸馏模块（MSSD）和模型无关因果推理模块（MACI）：MSSD通过权重共享自蒸馏增强特征鲁棒性，MACI利用多模态因果模块和反事实文本消除偏差，并引入词级自对齐注意力机制和复合Transformer优化计算效率。

Result: 在重构的MER OOD数据集上，CIDer以更少参数（比SOTA方法减少30%）和更快训练速度（提速15%），在RMFM任务和OOD场景中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CIDer通过创新性结构设计实现了多模态情感识别在现实复杂条件下的实用化突破，其模块化组件可独立应用，代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的皮肤癌分类模型受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性评估，可能影响临床应用的可靠性和性能。研究旨在通过迁移学习和UQ提升模型分类准确性及结果可信度。

Method: 分两阶段：1）对比多种预训练特征提取器（CLIP变体、ResNet50等）与传统分类器（SVM、XGBoost等）的性能；2）引入MCD、集成及EMCD方法进行不确定性量化，并使用UAcc、USen等指标评估模型。

Result: CLIP ViT-H/14结合SVM分类性能最佳；集成方法在准确性与不确定性处理间平衡较好，而EMCD对不确定预测更敏感。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化整合至深度学习医疗诊断中，可提升模型在真实临床场景中的性能和可信度，其中集成方法为实用优选方案。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VideoDeepResearch框架，仅用纯文本推理模型结合多模态工具包即显著提升长视频理解任务性能，挑战了传统依赖复杂多模态大模型的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为长视频理解需依赖具备扩展上下文窗口、强视觉感知和领域知识的复杂多模态大模型，但本文质疑这一假设，探索更轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于纯文本大型推理模型(LRM)的代理框架，通过多模态工具包（检索器+感知器）动态制定策略并选择性提取视频关键内容，避免全量处理长视频数据。

Result: 在MLVU、LVBench等基准测试中分别以9.6%、6.6%和3.9%的优势超越SOTA，验证了代理系统在长视频理解任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过智能系统设计（策略规划+工具调用）可突破传统模型限制，为长视频理解提供新范式，降低对复杂基础架构的依赖。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种弱监督多模态框架，通过病变图像和稀疏临床文本自动生成结构化SOAP病历，降低人工标注依赖并缓解医生负担。该方法性能可比GPT-4o等模型，并引入MedConceptEval和CCS两项临床评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌治疗中手动撰写SOAP病历耗时耗力，导致临床医生职业倦怠。现有方法依赖大量标注数据且难以规模化应用，需开发自动化解决方案。

Method: 基于弱监督学习的多模态框架，整合皮肤病变图像与少量临床文本数据，通过结构化生成技术自动输出符合SOAP格式的临床病历。

Result: 在临床相关性指标上达到与GPT-4o/Claude/DeepSeek Janus Pro相当水平，新提出的MedConceptEval和CCS指标有效验证了医学概念语义对齐与临床特征一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低临床文档撰写负担，减少数据标注需求，并通过创新评估体系为医疗AI的临床落地提供了可扩展的技术路径。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究测试两种视觉语言模型（VLM）在在线学习环境中识别学生学术情绪的表现，发现Qwen模型在困惑和快乐情绪识别上表现较优，但均无法检测分心行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习模型在学术情绪分析中泛化能力不足，需反复收集数据和训练。视觉语言模型（VLM）通过零样本提示实现跨任务泛化，为替代方案提供可能。

Method: 使用Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct两种VLM模型，通过零样本提示分析5,000张包含困惑、分心、快乐、中性及疲惫表情的学生图像。

Result: Qwen模型整体表现优于Llama，两者均擅长识别快乐情绪，但无法检测分心行为。Qwen在困惑情绪识别中表现突出，具备实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在学术情绪识别中展现潜力，尤其是Qwen模型检测学生困惑情绪的应用前景，但分心行为检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Conclusion: 该方法为城市风格演化提供量化解释工具，结合科学依据与数据驱动分析，助力未来城市设计的客观决策。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Conclusion: 直接从视频学习上下文图像编辑是可行的，块因果架构与多任务训练使模型具备通用编辑能力，为多模态序列建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Motivation: 知识图像对人类学习至关重要（如双编码理论所示），但生成此类图像需融合世界知识与像素级视觉表达，现有模型在此类任务中的推理能力尚未被系统评估。

Method: 构建MMMG基准（含4,456个专家验证的知识图像-提示对），采用统一知识图谱表示核心实体关系，提出MMMG-Score指标（结合知识图谱编辑距离与视觉清晰度）评估模型。

Result: 16个SOTA模型评测显示严重推理缺陷（如实体保真度低、关系弱、视觉混乱），GPT-4o仅得50.20分；开源基线FLUX-Reason得34.45分（基于16,000个训练对）。

Conclusion: MMMG揭示了图像生成模型的推理短板，通过释放基准与基线模型，为多模态推理研究提供新方向与资源支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated

Conclusion: 解耦视觉编码有效解决多模态任务冲突，图像理解与生成存在协同关系，推动统一模型领域发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Conclusion: 权重初始化是提升DNN鲁棒性的关键因素，GHN-QAT为量化感知初始化提供了创新解决方案。未来可结合量化感知训练进一步优化流程，推动低比特量化实用化。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PSLG-SAM框架，通过两阶段（粗定位+精细分割）解决遥感图像分割任务中的标注负担与复杂场景问题，实验显示其超越现有方法并开源数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RRSIS方法依赖多模态融合模型和密集标注，面临复杂场景干扰与高标注成本问题。需降低标注需求并提升分割精度。

Method: 1. 粗定位阶段：视觉定位网络初步定位文本描述对象；2. 精细分割阶段：基于坐标引导增强SAM模型，结合聚类前景点生成与掩膜迭代优化策略，第二阶段可无需训练。

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M数据集上取得显著性能提升，超越当前最优模型。开源高质量多类别标注数据集。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM通过任务分解降低标注负担，聚焦特定区域分割，有效应对复杂场景，为遥感图像分割提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出ViCrit任务，通过强化学习训练视觉语言模型定位人工注入的视觉描述错误，显著提升跨领域视觉感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在视觉语言模型中的应用受限于缺乏兼具挑战性与明确可验证性的视觉任务，需设计新方法突破瓶颈。

Method: 在200字人工描述中注入单处细微视觉幻觉错误(如属性/数量/空间关系)，训练模型基于图像定位错误文本片段，提供精确匹配的二元奖励信号。

Result: ViCrit训练模型在多个VL基准测试中表现显著提升，跨域抽象图像推理和视觉数学任务中展现强泛化能力，证明其超越单纯记忆的学习效果。

Conclusion: 细粒度幻觉批判是增强视觉语言模型感知能力的有效通用目标，ViCrit-Bench诊断基准为系统评估提供了标准化工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Motivation: 现有视频大模型在流式视频推理中依赖全部历史上下文，导致计算负担重且无关信息干扰模型注意力，需解决高效相关上下文筛选问题。

Method: 提出CogReasoner模型，采用视觉流压缩降低数据量，结合历史对话检索机制动态提取关键上下文，并构建半自动标注的层次化问答数据集。

Result: 实验验证模型能有效识别相关上下文，显著降低计算开销，在流式视频推理任务中表现优于传统全上下文输入方法。

Conclusion: CogStream任务及配套方法为实时流式视频理解提供了新基准，压缩与检索策略平衡了效率与准确性，代码即将开源。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出综合公平指数（CEI）及其自动化版本CEI^A，用于检测人脸识别系统中传统指标难以捕捉的尾部人口统计偏差，通过分离分析真实/冒认分数分布实现更精准的公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性指标难以检测高性能人脸识别系统在分数分布尾部存在的细微人口统计偏差，特别是对尾部概率差异不敏感。

Method: 提出CEI指标：1) 分别分析真实匹配与冒认匹配的分数分布 2) 可配置关注尾部概率 3) 考虑整体分布形态。开发自动化版本CEI^A提升客观性。

Result: 实验表明CEI在检测故意偏置模型和SOTA人脸系统偏差时优于现有方法，尤其在尾部差异分析中展现敏感性。方法具有跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: CEI为人脸生物识别提供了更鲁棒的公平评估工具，其基于分布尾部比较的方法可扩展至其他需要分析统计分布差异的领域。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法因扩散过程中先前纹理信息整合不足、自回归合成特性及固定相机位置，导致视角间纹理属性偏移和一致性差。

Method: 结合重采样方案在扩散过程中整合历史纹理信息，微调深度感知扩散模型并设计性能保持损失，同时根据物体几何形状自适应调整相机位置。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过增强纹理信息整合与几何自适应视角选择，显著提升了跨视角纹理一致性，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Motivation: 现有流匹配方法在跨任务统一建模、严格一对一映射限制及迭代推理效率上存在不足。本文旨在构建一个支持多任务、保留语义结构且高效采样的统一生成框架。

Method: 提出对称学习目标联合建模前向/反向流，保持双向一致性；设计显式语义保留机制，支持像素级和图像级条件输入；通过单步推理实现分割/分类，避免迭代优化。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别取得11.9和7.0的FID分数（25步推理），语义图像合成性能SOTA；分割和分类任务表现接近专用模型。

Conclusion: SymmFlow首次实现生成、分割、分类的多任务统一建模，在保持生成多样性的同时提升推理效率，为通用生成模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有基于原型的方法在医学图像中存在两个问题：(1) 像素空间可视化与人类可理解的生物标志物不一致；(2) 过于细粒度的原型难以反映病变范围这一关键临床特征。

Method: 提出PiPViT模型：利用视觉Transformer捕捉图像块间长程依赖，仅使用图像级标签学习近似病变范围的原型；结合对比学习和多分辨率输入处理实现跨尺度生物标志物定位。

Result: 在四个视网膜OCT数据集上取得与SOTA相当的分类性能，测试集验证显示学习到的原型具有临床语义相关性，能提供比现有方法更有意义的解释。

Conclusion: PiPViT通过可解释的原型学习为诊断决策提供透明化解释，有助于临床医生理解诊断依据，在保持性能的同时提升模型可解释性。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Result: 改进后的Transformer在语言/视觉任务中表现出更高的准确性、对抗污染的鲁棒性及长序列理解能力，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 图像处理视角为自注意力机制提供了理论解释与改进方向，证明可解释性与性能提升可协同实现，弥合了机制理解与应用优化之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成黄金标准实现了高效缺陷检测，验证了其在表面缺陷检测流程中的实际应用价值，为无黄金模板场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Method: 结合笔画矢量放大器（将图像分解为矢量笔画进行放大）和细节补全模块，通过循环迭代策略实现单次训练支持任意倍率超分辨率，保持子尺度在训练范围内。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上验证，100倍放大任务中视觉质量显著优于现有方法，有效消除伪影/噪声/模糊，实现高保真重建。

Conclusion: SbCA通过矢量分解与循环优化机制，突破传统方法放大倍数限制，为超大规模图像超分辨率提供统一解决方案。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分结合物理知识且缺乏跨场景验证，尤其在涉及流体与物体交互时，需模型同时捕捉物体相互作用与流体特性。

Method: SlotPi结合基于哈密顿原理的物理模块与时空预测模块，实现动态场景的物理推理与预测。

Conclusion: SlotPi的强适应性为高级世界模型奠定基础，证明物理知识整合与跨场景验证对动态推理的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

TL;DR: 本文提出首个针对视频抠图模型的后训练量化框架PTQ4VM，通过两阶段优化策略、全局仿射校准和光流辅助组件，在超低位宽下实现接近全精度的性能，显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频抠图模型在资源受限设备部署时面临计算密集和时序一致性保持的挑战，现有后训练量化方法在该领域尚不成熟，存在精度损失和统计失真问题。

Method: 1) 两阶段PTQ策略：先通过块重建优化实现快速稳定初始化，再全局校准量化参数；2) 统计驱动的全局仿射校准(GAC)补偿BN层等统计误差；3) 光流辅助组件(OFA)利用时序语义先验增强运动前景区分能力。

Conclusion: 该框架首次系统解决视频抠图量化难题，通过统计补偿和时序引导实现了高效部署，为视频任务量化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视时间推理与过程有效性，无法全面衡量大模型的多步推理能力，需构建更贴近真实场景的长视频基准。

Method: 采用多阶段视频筛选（含情节连贯性专家评审）构建数据集，开发人机协作框架生成时序推理链，设计含结果层与过程层的多阶段评估流程，并提出基于LLM的进度级评分指标。

Conclusion: VRBench通过时序锚定推理链和复合评估机制，推动了多步推理研究，为模型优化提供了细粒度诊断依据。

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迭代优化的零样本生成模型适应方法（AIR），通过分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本与图像偏移不对齐的问题，发现概念距离与偏移偏差相关，并设计新方法显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本生成模型适应方法（ZSGM）假设CLIP嵌入空间中图像偏移与文本偏移完全对齐，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在解决这一偏移不对齐问题。

Method: 提出Adaptation with Iterative Refinement（AIR），首次通过迭代优化策略减少偏移不对齐，利用概念距离与偏移偏差的关联性，逐步优化目标域生成质量。

Result: 在26个实验场景中，AIR在定性、定量指标及用户研究中均达到SOTA性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分析CLIP偏移不对齐现象并提出AIR方法，本文在零样本生成模型适应任务中实现了生成质量的显著提升，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的文本到视频生成方法因二次计算复杂度导致高计算成本，而Mamba架构虽高效但难以处理多模态时空建模。需设计更高效的框架以平衡计算效率与生成质量。

Method: 提出多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM），通过多模态token重组整合时空与跨模态信息；引入奖励学习策略缓解长序列生成中的画面质量退化问题。

Result: 在768×1280分辨率视频生成中，M4V相比注意力机制降低45% FLOPs，实验表明其能高效生成高质量视频，且奖励学习有效提升单帧视觉真实感。

Conclusion: M4V通过Mamba架构创新与奖励学习，在文本到视频任务中实现计算效率与生成质量的平衡，为高效世界模拟器开发提供新方向。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.
Code and models will be publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SpectralAR框架，通过频谱视角构建因果性视觉序列，实现高效自回归图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉生成方法将图像视为空间块序列，但图像块本质并行，与自回归因果性矛盾。

Method: 采用嵌套频谱标记化将图像转换为有序频谱标记（低频到高频），并以从粗到细方式自回归生成序列。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现3.02 gFID，仅需64个标记和310M参数，兼顾生成质量与效率。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱分解解决了视觉序列因果性问题，在保持高效的同时实现高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

TL;DR: 提出CDPruner方法，通过最大化条件多样性的视觉令牌剪枝，显著降低多模态大语言模型推理成本，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法存在冗余保留或忽略指令相关性的问题，导致计算成本高且性能次优。

Method: 基于条件相似性定义，利用行列式点过程（DPP）最大化保留令牌的条件多样性，实现无需训练、模型无关的剪枝。

Result: 在LLaVA上减少95% FLOPs和78% CUDA延迟，保持94%原精度；多基准测试达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性优化令牌选择，在高效压缩的同时保持指令对齐与图像表征能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有扩散模型中的注意力扰动方法缺乏确定扰动位置的系统性原则，尤其在DiT架构中，质量相关计算分布于各层。层级扰动易导致过平滑且无法精准控制特定属性。

Method: 提出HeadHunter框架迭代选择与用户目标对齐的注意力头，并设计SoftPAG方法通过线性插值将选定头的注意力图向单位矩阵调整，实现连续强度控制。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等DiT模型上验证，该方法在生成质量提升和风格控制方面优于现有方法，同时发现注意力头具有控制结构/风格/纹理的明确分工特性。

Conclusion: 首次实现扩散模型注意力头的可解释性分析，揭示其视觉概念分工特性，提出的头级扰动策略为生成控制提供了新的方法论，支持组合式视觉风格调控。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Motivation: 关键残基对蛋白质功能至关重要，但现有识别方法需进一步优化与验证，因此探索基于图论与动态演化的新方法具有必要性。

Method: 1. 基于Cramer's V相关性构建RGG，通过有机阈值法与节点度定义关键性；2. 通过全图与单残基缺失图后验概率差异排名；3. 分析模拟过程中节点度的动态变化。

Conclusion: 基于RGG的三种参数化方法为关键残基识别提供了多维度视角，且与实验数据具有一致性，表明其在蛋白质功能分析中的实用价值。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Motivation: 现有TAA方法依赖标注数据且易受数据偏差影响，导致难以捕捉真实事故特征。本文旨在通过生成因果视频片段解决背景混淆问题，减少对标注的依赖。

Method: 提出注意力视频扩散模型（AVD），根据文本提示生成事故/非事故视频片段并保持内容一致性；结合EQ-TAA框架，利用生成的正-负对比样本和等变三重损失优化模型。

Conclusion: 通过生成因果事故片段和等变对比学习，本文方法显著提升TAA性能，为无监督交通事故预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been

### [245] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、跨模态GAN重建和混合训练协议，实现灵活单/双模态HER2预测，显著提高准确率并降低IHC基础设施成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型孤立分析H&E或IHC图像，但临床需协同解读。双模态同步获取受限于流程复杂性和成本，需开发灵活预测方案。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器按输入完整性激活单模态重建或双模态联合推理；2) 双向跨模态GAN实现缺失模态的上下文感知特征重建；3) 结合对抗学习和多任务优化的混合训练协议。

Result: 单模态H&E准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态达95.09%；IHC单模态保持90.28%可靠性。跨模态重建F1-score达0.9609(HE→IHC)和0.9251(IHC→HE)，轻量版参数减少78.55%。

Conclusion: 弹性架构通过重建增强/原生融合路径动态路由，在降低资源需求的同时实现近双模态性能，为不同医疗场景提供高精度HER2评估解决方案。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的多模态可控3D面部动画框架，通过多模态情感绑定策略与注意力潜在扩散模型，解决了传统方法在情感控制多样性和表情随机性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动3D面部动画存在两大问题：(1)依赖单一模态控制信号，未能整合多模态互补优势；(2)确定性回归方法限制了表情随机性与非语言行为多样性，导致动画表现力不足。

Method: 提出FLAME中心的多模态情感对比绑定策略，实现跨模态对齐；设计含内容感知注意力与情感引导层的潜在扩散模型，在保持时序连贯性的同时增强运动多样性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多数指标上优于现有方法，情感相似度提升21.6%，且保持生理合理的面部动态。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过多模态融合与扩散模型生成机制，实现了高表现力、可控且符合生理特征的3D面部动画，为跨模态情感表达提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层知识图谱框架，用于结构化解析漫画等多模态视觉叙事，通过多级分解和知识图谱整合，支持跨层次的符号推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解析视觉叙事时缺乏对多层次结构（如故事线、事件片段）和跨模态关系的统一表示，限制了叙事连贯性与推理能力。

Method: 构建分层知识图谱：宏观故事线→细粒度事件段→面板级多模态图，整合视觉元素（角色/物体/动作）与文本（对话/旁白）的语义、时空关系。

Result: 在Manga109标注子集上验证框架有效性，任务（动作检索/对话追踪等）平均精度和召回率均表现优异，证实图谱的连贯性与可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉媒体的叙事分析、交互式故事生成及多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础，推动结构化内容理解的技术发展。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

Motivation: 现有多模态意图识别方法过度依赖文本分析，忽视了视频、音频等非语言模态中丰富的语义信息，导致对用户意图的理解不够全面。

Method: 提出小波驱动融合模块（频域同步分解视频-音频特征）和跨模态交互机制（从双模态到三模态渐进增强），通过频域细粒度分析弥补语言与非语言信息的语义鸿沟。

Result: 在MIntRec数据集上准确率达SOTA（提升1.13%），消融实验显示小波融合模块使非语言情感线索识别准确率提升0.41%。

Conclusion: WDMIR框架通过频域分析和渐进式跨模态交互，有效提升了非语言语义的提取能力，验证了时频联合建模在多模态意图识别中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 对话时序结构通过调节多模态同步窗口影响情感表达清晰度，语音特征与局部运动预测模型为实时情感识别提供时序对齐依据，情绪类型与交互场景的耦合效应对AI情感交互系统设计具有启示。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种将预训练去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为分数生成先验直接集成到全波形反演（FWI）中的框架，通过分数重匹配策略避免传统扩散模型的反向采样过程，在干净图像空间操作，提升计算效率和反演质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在非线性求解器（如FWI）中因反向扩散过程及含噪中间状态导致数值伪影和反演质量差，亟需一种稳定且高效的方法解决物理约束下的地震成像问题。

Method: 通过分数重匹配策略将预训练DDPM作为正则化项引入FWI更新规则，无需反向扩散采样，减少迭代次数，直接在干净图像空间进行反演，最小化对现有流程的修改。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在保真度、鲁棒性上优于传统FWI和基于GAN的方法，且计算高效，能促进稳定的波传播并改善收敛行为。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过分数生成扩散先验有效提升FWI的稳定性和反演质量，为地震成像及其他逆问题提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Motivation: 开发一种自动化方法，利用多源雷达数据与电离层建模结果，解决电离层散射雷达数据处理中复杂分类问题，减少人工干预并提高分析效率。

Method: 基于12个雷达两年数据训练模型（系数2669个），整合射线追踪模拟参数与雷达实测参数，通过流星尾迹散射信号校准仰角测量，并采用数学标准评估模型质量。

Result: 识别出37个数据类别（25类高频出现），其中14类可稳定区分，10类完成初步物理解释。分类关键参数为射线轨迹后半段形态、散射高度及多普勒速度，其地理纬度依赖性符合已知物理机制。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效分类电离层散射数据，关键参数验证了分类结果的物理合理性，为后续电离层动态研究提供了自动化分析框架。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略证明机制无法有效逼近最优基尼指数，导致公平性优化受限。因此需探索其他公平性指标（如补充基尼指数和纳什福利）的近似可能性。

Method: 通过理论证明策略证明机制在基尼指数上的不可能性结果，并分析确定性与随机机制对补充基尼指数及纳什福利的近似比。

Result: 证明无策略证明机制能有效逼近最优基尼指数，但补充基尼指数和纳什福利可通过特定机制实现近似优化，其中随机机制表现更优。

Conclusion: 策略证明机制在基尼指数优化中存在根本性限制，但补充指标和纳什福利为公平性权衡提供了可行路径，需进一步研究机制设计。

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Motivation: 新法西斯主义在西方社会迅速蔓延，严重威胁民主与少数群体。现有研究缺乏结合政治学与自然语言处理的系统性分析工具，需开发针对性检测方法以遏制其扩散。

Method: 1. 创建首个新法西斯主义数字话语编码方案
2. 采集Iron March和Stormfront论坛数据
3. 通过人工标注构建千条分类数据集
4. 微调小型与大型语言模型进行分类测试

Result: 成功训练出首批新法西斯主义分类模型，验证了极端言论在目标论坛中的持续普遍性，证明社会语境是NLP检测中的关键因素。

Conclusion: 对抗新法西斯主义需持续结合跨学科方法，数字话语检测对维护民主社会至关重要，未来研究应聚焦社会背景化分析。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨利用大语言模型（LLMs）为在线学习者生成个性化答案，通过提供示例显著提升模型定制能力，并采用多种评估方法验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习需个性化支持以提升学习体验，但为每个学习者定制答案会增加教育者负担。LLMs可自动化生成个性化回答，减轻负担并增强学习效果。

Method: 基于StackExchange平台构建数据集，设计0-shot、1-shot、few-shot策略生成个性化答案，并通过BERTScore、LLM评估和人工评估三种方法验证效果。

Result: 实验表明，向LLMs提供学习者或类似学习者的示例（few-shot）能显著提升答案的针对性，优于无示例（0-shot）或单示例（1-shot）场景。

Conclusion: LLMs在个性化教育中具有潜力，结合学习者历史数据或相似案例可优化答案生成，未来可扩展至更多领域并探索动态个性化策略。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出FastFLUX框架，通过结构剪枝和局部微调提升扩散变换器（如FLUX）的推理效率，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成图像模型（如FLUX）因参数量大导致推理速度慢、内存占用高且难以部署。传统加速方法（单步蒸馏、注意力剪枝）存在性能下降明显、训练成本高的问题。

Method: 1. 提出BRLL方法：用轻量线性层替换ResBlock中的复杂残差分支，保留原始快捷连接；2. 设计三明治训练策略（ST）：通过LoRA对相邻模块进行局部微调，缓解结构替换导致的性能损失。

Result: 实验表明FastFLUX在定量/定性评估中均保持高质量图像生成，即使剪枝20%层次结构时推理速度仍显著提升。

Conclusion: FastFLUX通过架构级剪枝与针对性训练策略，实现了扩散变换器效率与性能的有效平衡，为实际部署提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出Ambient Diffusion Omni框架，通过利用低质量/合成/分布外图像提升扩散模型性能，利用噪声平衡数据分布，在ImageNet和文本生成任务中实现SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖高质量过滤数据，但大量低质量图像被丢弃。本文旨在挖掘这些被忽视数据的潜在价值，解决数据偏差与有限无偏数据间的平衡问题。

Method: 基于自然图像的频谱功率律衰减和局部性特性，设计框架处理混合分布数据。通过噪声注入削弱初始数据分布差异，实现全图像信号提取。

Result: 在合成损坏图像上验证有效性后，ImageNet FID达SOTA水平，文本到图像生成任务中图像质量与多样性显著提升。

Conclusion: 噪声能有效调节数据分布偏差，理论分析揭示了有偏数据与有限无偏数据间的权衡机制，为低质量数据利用提供理论支撑。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），通过引入密度均匀性和几何规则性损失函数及分层预测方法，解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和3D扩展上的局限性，并在2D/3D领域展现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡地图（DEM）方法依赖迭代数值求解或手工能量优化，存在精度不足、极端情况重叠伪影、2D扩展至3D需大幅重构算法等问题，亟需更鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于深度神经网络的LDEM框架：设计强制密度均匀与几何规则的损失函数，采用分层结构预测粗粒度与密集层次变换，无需依赖导数型能量公式。

Result: LDEM在多种密度分布下均优于传统方法，具备更优的密度均衡性与双射性，可无缝扩展至3D且无需调整架构，支持不同效果的表面重网格化应用。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射提供了可扩展、鲁棒的计算范式，突破了传统方法在复杂场景与跨维度应用中的瓶颈，开辟了实际应用新路径。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest是一个基于大语言模型的自动化测试框架，通过协同Gen-LLM、Val-LLM和Debug-LLM，显著减少O-RAN多厂商组件测试时间并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN的开放架构导致多厂商组件测试复杂化，现有手动测试框架存在效率低、碎片化及人为错误问题，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出AI5GTest框架：Gen-LLM根据规范生成测试流程，Val-LLM验证信号合规性，Debug-LLM进行根因分析，并引入人机协同机制提升透明度。

Result: 基于O-RAN TIFG/WG5-IOT测试用例的实验显示，相比传统方法显著缩短测试时间，同时维持高验证准确率。

Conclusion: AI5GTest通过LLM协同与人机回圈机制，有效解决O-RAN测试自动化难题，提升测试效率与可信度，推动开放网络生态发展。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义代理层和新型通信协议的扩展方案，以增强月球表面无线通信系统的情境感知与自适应决策能力，解决现有Space-O-RAN框架静态策略和语义集成不足的问题。


<details>

Conclusion: 所提出的语义代理架构显著增强了月球通信系统的上下文推理能力，为复杂太空任务提供了可扩展的自主通信解决方案。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Conclusion: 模块化框架为可扩展导航系统奠定基础，未来可通过强化环境先验知识和扩展多模态输入集成进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑预测任务中，道路环境信息常隐含于自然语言形式的设计规范（如道路结构编码）和道路功能名称中，但未被充分挖掘。利用此类结构化先验知识可提升模型性能。

Method: 在SMERF模型基础上，融合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据、道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验知识，以及道路中心线编码，形成多源信息增强框架。

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为未来基于场景的自动驾驶验证框架提供了更可靠的统计建模基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Conclusion: VLFly通过端到端连续控制架构突破传统离散动作限制，仅依赖单目视觉即可完成复杂语言引导导航，为无人机自主导航提供新范式。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

### [270] [Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10153)
*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Transformer的强化学习框架，通过俯仰控制调节气动升力，解决了强扰动序列中线性控制策略失效的问题。结合专家策略预训练与任务级迁移学习加速训练，证明该方法在连续阵风环境中优于传统比例控制，且四分之一弦长控制相比中弦长控制具有更优的升力调节效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性流控策略在强扰动序列中因非线性相互作用失效，但可基于其开发更优策略。研究旨在通过智能控制解决有限传感器下的部分可观测性挑战，并提升多阵风场景的升力调节性能。

Method: 采用Transformer架构处理压力传感器数据的部分可观测性，结合专家策略（线性控制）预训练与任务级迁移学习（从单阵风到多阵风）加速强化学习训练。通过升力分解与不同控制点（四分之一弦长/中弦长）配置对比分析控制机理。

Result: 学习策略在连续阵风场景中显著优于最佳比例控制，且泛化至任意长阵风序列。四分之一弦长控制相比中弦长减少75%控制能耗，其优势源于通过俯仰运动有效利用附加质量效应。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的Transformer框架结合加速技术，可有效解决复杂流控问题。四分之一弦长控制因附加质量效应主导而具有显著优势，验证了该框架在多配置场景下的通用性，为高计算需求流控问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

*Rui Zhang,Qi Meng,Han Wan,Yang Liu,Zhi-Ming Ma,Hao Sun*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids提出了一种结合物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少样本微调的统一框架，在有限数据下实现高效、高精度的流体动力学模拟，相比传统方法加速10-100倍，并在多类基准测试中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFD方法计算成本高，现有AI方法（如PINNs和纯数据驱动算子）存在训练成本高、依赖大量标注数据或稳定性不足的问题，需开发兼顾效率、精度和数据利用率的流体模拟新范式。

Method: 通过混合算子架构、多帧解码器和因子化傅里叶层实现物理约束嵌入，结合三阶段流程：纯物理预训练→粗网格算子知识蒸馏→少量数据微调，支持零样本/少样本场景下的快速推理。

Result: 在2D/3D基准测试中，流场重建和湍流统计精度显著优于SOTA方法，相比经典求解器提速10-100倍，并能从稀疏噪声数据中准确恢复未知物理参数。

Conclusion: OmniFluids建立了数据受限场景下复杂流体系统高效代理建模的新范式，通过物理先验与数据驱动的深度融合实现通用性与精度的统一。

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Motivation: 现有离散音频标记研究多聚焦特定领域或任务，缺乏跨领域统一基准比较。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统性分析不同方法的性能权衡与实践考量。

Method: 提出基于编码器-解码器结构、量化技术、训练范式、流式处理和应用领域的分类法，通过多领域基准测试（重建、下游任务、声学建模）及消融实验评估不同标记化方法。

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过在推理时干预MusicGen自回归生成音乐变换器，实现音色转换、风格迁移和流派融合的细粒度控制方法。该方法结合线性探针权重引导残差流和注意力层激活控制，配合文本提示的全局条件，达到全局与局部双重调控效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐生成模型缺乏细粒度控制能力，难以在保持全局语义的同时实现音色、风格等局部特征的定向调整。

Method: 1. 在推理时通过训练好的线性探针权重引导残差流
2. 采用注意力层激活引导机制
3. 将控制建模为回归任务，使用均方误差保留激活空间方向信息
4. 结合MusicGen原有的文本全局条件控制

Result: 成功实现音色/风格转换与流派融合，验证了回归任务在保留激活空间语义方向性方面的有效性，音频样本展示了全局与局部控制的协同作用。

Conclusion: 通过推理时干预机制与文本提示的结合，建立了多尺度音乐生成控制框架，为生成模型的可控性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

TL;DR: 本文通过优化音频编码器与大型语言模型（LLM）的交互架构，提出延迟音频整合、仅利用注意力模块探测音频表示及集成多编码器等方法，显著提升跨模态信息传递效率，相对基线性能提升10%-60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-LLM研究多关注应用层数据训练，但对音频编码器与LLM间语义传递的底层设计机制缺乏深入探索。本文旨在通过系统化架构设计优化，提升LLM对音频表征的探测能力。

Method: 基于标准Pengi/LLaVA架构，提出三项改进：1）延迟音频输入至LLM初始层后以增强文本上下文引导；2）仅通过LLM注意力子模块探测音频表示，无需前馈网络；3）集成多样化音频编码器提供互补表征。所有假设在560万音频-文本对数据集上采用三阶段训练验证。

Result: 实验表明：延迟整合使LLM更有效提取音频信息；注意力模块单独探测足够高效；多编码器集成扩展信息覆盖。最终架构相对基线实现10%-60%性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过延迟跨模态交互时机、简化表征探测路径及多编码器融合，系统优化了音频-LLM的跨模态信息传递机制，验证了架构设计对提升模型能力的关键作用。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: 本文提出BNMusic框架，通过生成与用户文本提示匹配的个性化音乐，将环境噪音融入其中，并自适应调整音量以减少噪音感知，提升听觉体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声学掩蔽技术因主导声音与噪音节奏不匹配需过度增大音量，受跨模态生成启发，探索通过生成个性化音乐实现更自然的噪音融合。

Method: 两阶段方法：首先生成包含噪音音乐特征的梅尔频谱图音乐；第二阶段自适应放大音乐片段以优化噪音遮蔽效果并保持音质。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效生成节奏对齐、听觉愉悦的音乐片段，显著降低噪音可察觉性。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架通过跨模态生成与自适应音量调节，实现了环境噪音与个性化音乐的自然融合，为声学体验优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Motivation: 自监督学习(SSL)在单细胞数据分析中潜力显著，但缺乏系统性评估框架。研究旨在揭示不同SSL方法在单细胞任务中的性能差异，并为方法选择提供指导。

Method: 构建scSSL-Bench基准，在9个数据集上评估19种SSL方法，聚焦批次校正、细胞注释、多模态预测三大任务，并系统分析数据增强策略的有效性。

Result: 专用框架(scVI/CLAIRE/scGPT)在单模态批次校正占优，通用SSL方法(VICReg/SimCLR)在细胞分型和多模态整合更优；随机掩码增强跨任务表现最佳，需开发专用单细胞多模态整合框架。

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench为SSL在单细胞分析中的应用提供标准化评估体系与方法推荐，推动深度学习与单细胞组学的深度融合，强调任务适配性与专用框架开发的必要性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Motivation: 评估基因组语言模型（gLMs）在预测合成生物学中关键功能突变时的有效性，尤其是其是否能在生成DNA序列时兼顾进化合理性与功能关联。

Method: 提出名为Nullsettes的预测任务，通过模拟关键调控元件易位产生的功能丧失突变，测试12种前沿模型对突变效应的预测能力。

Result: 模型预测突变效应的性能与未突变序列的预测似然性显著相关，且有效预测区间高度依赖序列长度。

Conclusion: 使用gLMs预测突变效应时，需同时权衡序列似然性和长度，以优化功能预测的准确性。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Conclusion: 隐藏单元先验分布的设计是提升RBM表达能力的关键，结构修改可有效增强其联想记忆性能，统计物理学工具为分析此类模型提供了重要视角。

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法依赖大量人工标注数据，成本高昂。虽然合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法常需复杂提示或辅助模型。本文旨在利用LLM攻击技术重构为安全对齐提供更高效方案。

Method: 提出Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI)框架：1) 检测模型内部拒绝信号；2) 自适应注入预定义短语以诱导生成有害但语法流畅的补全内容，无需训练且兼容不同模型。

Result: RAAI攻击使有害响应率从基线2.15%提升至平均61.04%（覆盖4个基准）。基于RAAI合成数据微调的模型在MMLU/ARC等标准任务中保持性能，同时显著增强对有害提示的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

*Haoyang Li,Huan Gao,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zhiyu Lin,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究提出MalwareBench基准数据集，评估大型语言模型在代码生成中抵御越狱攻击的能力，发现主流模型对恶意请求的拒绝率较低，且多方法组合攻击进一步削弱安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注大型语言模型的通用安全能力，但其在代码生成场景下对越狱攻击的脆弱性尚未充分探索，需针对性评估与验证。

Method: 构建包含3,520个恶意代码生成提示的基准数据集MalwareBench，涵盖320个手动设计的恶意需求、11种越狱方法及29种代码功能类别。

Result: 主流模型对恶意内容的平均拒绝率为60.93%，结合越狱攻击算法后降至39.92%，表明模型安全防护能力显著下降。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在代码生成场景下的安全防御能力存在严重不足，需进一步研究提升其抵御越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出私有记忆编辑（PME）方法，将大型语言模型的记忆能力转化为隐私防御策略，有效减少个人身份信息（PII）泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能记忆并泄露训练数据中的个人身份信息（PII），需防止此类隐私泄露风险。

Method: 通过检测模型记忆的PII并编辑其训练数据知识，减少隐私数据记忆，同时保持模型语言能力不变。

Result: PME显著降低PII泄露数量，部分场景下隐私攻击准确率降至零，且不影响模型基础性能。

Conclusion: PME成功将模型记忆能力转化为防御工具，增强对抗隐私攻击的鲁棒性，为隐私保护提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs（如ChatGPT和Gemini）的广泛应用，其引发的网络安全问题（如越狱、错误信息传播）亟需系统性评估与对策研究。

Method: 通过对比分析ChatGPT与Gemini的安全机制，提出越狱技术分类框架，并设计实验验证其安全漏洞。

Result: 实验揭示了两种模型在应对提示注入、越狱攻击时的差异，部分场景中安全措施易被绕过，且存在幻觉风险。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the
spread of misinformation (hallucinations) and risks associated with deep fakes.
This paper presents a comparative analysis of the security and alignment levels
of ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as a taxonomy of jailbreak techniques associated

TL;DR: 本文提出首个多模态RAG系统中图像知识版权保护的水印框架AQUA，通过嵌入语义信号实现高效、隐蔽的版权追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG水印方法仅保护文本知识，而服务化平台中共享图像知识缺乏版权保护，亟需解决多模态场景下的版权问题。

Method: 采用首字母触发器和空间关系线索两种互补方法，将语义水印嵌入合成图像，确保水印在跨模态传播中的存活性。

Result: 实验表明AQUA在不同模型和数据集上实现鲁棒、隐蔽且可靠的版权追踪，水印存活率达98%以上，感知干扰度低于0.1dB。

Conclusion: AQUA填补了多模态RAG系统图像版权保护的技术空白，为服务化平台贡献数据确权提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出GenBreak框架，通过微调红队大语言模型生成对抗性提示，有效绕过商业文本到图像模型的安全机制并生成高毒性内容，揭示其安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）模型的安全评估工具存在缺陷：对抗性提示易被检测或无法生成真正有害内容，亟需可靠方法评估模型安全性。

Method: 结合监督微调与强化学习，通过多奖励信号引导大语言模型生成兼具规避能力、毒性、语义连贯性和多样化的对抗提示。

Result: GenBreak生成的对抗提示在商业T2I模型黑盒攻击中表现优异，成功暴露实际安全漏洞。

Conclusion: GenBreak为T2I模型安全评估提供有效工具，揭示现有防御机制的脆弱性，突显实际应用中潜在的高风险。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在持续访问敏感数据时存在隐私泄露风险，现有单次对话防御措施无法有效应对多轮交互中的潜在漏洞，需系统化审计方法。

Method: 提出CMPL框架：采用迭代式多轮对话探测策略，模拟真实交互以系统性暴露代理在严格指令下的隐私漏洞，突破单次泄露检测局限。

Result: 跨领域评估表明，CMPL能有效识别现有单次防御无法阻止的隐私风险，且支持多模态数据和不同安全配置的测试验证。

Conclusion: CMPL作为诊断工具可揭示多轮对话中的隐私漏洞，其量化风险指标与开放基准为LLM代理的隐私保护提供了系统性审计方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

TL;DR: 研究发现部分机器遗忘方法在简单攻击下失效，需更可靠评估框架区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证现有机器遗忘方法是否真正移除知识，而非仅抑制输出，并挑战其抗提示攻击的鲁棒性假设。

Method: 系统评估3类模型家族的8种遗忘技术，采用输出、logit和探针分析，并开发公开评估框架检测知识残留。

Result: RMU/TAR表现稳健，但ELM在特定提示(如印地语填充文本)下恢复57.3%准确率；logit分析证实知识未被格式修改隐藏。

Conclusion: 现有遗忘效果评估存在缺陷，需建立能检测知识真实移除的框架，同时公开工具支持后续研究验证。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLMs常涉及隐私数据，易受成员推理攻击（MIA）威胁。研究发现MIA利用微调过程中损失值降低的特性推断数据归属，亟需开发兼顾隐私与效用的防御方案。

Method: 提出SOFT方法：基于影响力数据选择，对部分敏感数据进行混淆处理，并通过可调参数控制隐私保护与模型性能的权衡，实现选择性数据模糊化。

Result: 跨6个领域、多模型架构与规模的实验表明，SOFT显著降低隐私泄露风险（MIA攻击成功率下降），同时保持模型性能竞争力（任务准确率仅轻微下降）。

Conclusion: SOFT为LLMs微调提供了一种可扩展的隐私保护方案，通过动态数据混淆有效缓解成员推理攻击，为敏感信息处理提供实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究多单独评估LLM、推理技术或应用，但缺乏对多智能体系统联合规范与组合应用的探索，需明确系统化评估标准以挖掘其潜力。

Method: 扩展先前研究的系统架构与原型，引入多智能体系统规范，设计网络安全任务测试案例，结合OpenAI和DeepSeek的LLM进行实验验证。

Result: 测试表明，基于LLM的智能体能正确完成网络安全相关问答、服务器及网络防护任务，验证了架构与评估方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统在特定领域（如网络安全）具备应用潜力，需通过系统化规范与评估进一步释放其能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 现有基于TED的后门攻击检测方法在面对适应性攻击（如扭曲拓扑表示分布）时存在脆弱性，需提升其对抗动态恶意任务和隐蔽攻击的能力。

Method: 提出TED-LaST策略，包含标签监督动态跟踪（识别隐蔽威胁）和自适应层强调（应对拓扑扰动），并设计增强型自适应攻击（含目标映射）以验证防御效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GTSRB、ImageNet100数据集及ResNet等模型上，TED-LaST成功抵御Adap-Blend、Adapt-Patch及提出的增强攻击，检测准确率显著优于传统TED。

Conclusion: TED-LaST为后门检测设定了新基准，通过动态跟踪与层适应性增强，有效应对拓扑空间不可分性和隐蔽攻击，显著提升DNN安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

TL;DR: 本文针对生成扩散模型的版权侵权攻击问题，提出多元素（ME）攻击方法及新数据集，结合离散余弦变换（DCT）提升攻击效果和隐蔽性，实验显示在低样本情况下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法如SBD在数据资源、样本适用性和低样本攻击效果上存在不足，部分数据集因版权或内容问题受限，需改进攻击效能。

Method: 基于SBD提出多元素（ME）攻击方法，增加每个毒化样本的视觉-文本元素数量，并引入DCT保持隐蔽性，同时构建新数据集支持研究。

Result: 新数据集上的CIR/FAE分别达16.78%/39.50和51.20%/23.60，接近或超越基准数据集；低子采样率（5%）时，MESI与DCT的CIR/FAE为0.23%/84.00和12.73%/65.50，优于原SBD。

Conclusion: ME攻击方法结合DCT有效提升攻击能力，新数据集为研究提供支持，尤其在低毒化样本情况下表现显著优于SBD，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出一种针对Tree-Ring水印技术的新型攻击方法，仅需利用公开的变分自编码器即可显著降低检测器性能，揭示现有行业实践的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对Tree-Ring水印的移除攻击依赖过强的攻击者假设，而实际中训练扩散模型所用的变分自编码器往往公开可用，但此风险未被现有研究充分考虑。

Method: 通过访问目标扩散模型训练时使用的公开变分自编码器，近似模型中间潜在空间，构建更有效的代理攻击模型。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的ROC-AUC从0.993降至0.153，PR-AUC从0.994降至0.385，且图像质量保持，效果优于需完整访问扩散模型的现有方法。

Conclusion: 重用公共自编码器训练扩散模型存在重大安全风险，Tree-Ring检测器的精确度指标未达实际部署要求，当前行业实践需重新评估防御机制。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对汽车入侵检测系统（IDS）的基于梯度的对抗攻击在不同知识程度（白盒、灰盒、黑盒）下的可行性与影响，发现攻击效果依赖于数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者知识水平，并验证了实时攻击的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆CAN总线缺乏安全机制，且随着车辆互联性增加，易受网络攻击。现有IDS虽能防御但存在漏洞，对抗攻击（如逃避攻击）可通过输入篡改绕过检测，需评估不同攻击场景的实际威胁。

Method: 在三种攻击场景（白盒、灰盒、黑盒）下，基于公开数据集对先进IDS实施梯度对抗攻击，分析对抗扰动对攻击效果的影响，并通过预计算规避载荷验证基于总线流量的实时注入可行性。

Result: 实验表明，攻击有效性受数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者知识水平显著影响；尽管汽车领域约束使攻击复杂化，但预计算载荷可实现实时攻击。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对汽车IDS的威胁不仅受限于技术约束，更与系统及数据特性相关，需提升IDS鲁棒性并优化数据集以应对多场景攻击策略。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 当前LLM安全防御无法抵御分解攻击，本文提出轻量级顺序监控框架，在保持低成本低延迟的同时实现93%防御成功率，有效应对恶意意图分解攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐技术仅检测即时提示中的危害，无法识别通过分解为子任务隐藏的长期恶意意图，导致分解攻击成功率高达87%。

Method: 构建包含问答、文生图、代理任务的最大攻击数据集，提出基于提示工程的轻量级顺序监控框架，实时累积评估子任务意图。

Result: 防御成功率93%（优于o3 mini模型），抗随机任务注入攻击，成本降低90%且延迟减少50%，在GPT-4o验证中攻击成功率87%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控能有效抵御分解攻击，其部署可行性强，为LLM安全防御提供了高效实时解决方案。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

*Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Atsushi Kojima,Lianbo Liu,Yui Sudo*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对话延续训练的音频理解模型，利用大语言模型能力实现零样本指令跟随，无需多任务调优即可解决字幕变异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频字幕生成方法面临字幕表面词汇差异导致语义理解受限的问题，需通过对话延续机制捕捉深层语义。

Method: 将音频字幕生成任务转化为对话延续任务，训练模型根据输入字幕生成对话式响应，而非直接生成目标字幕。

Result: 在AudioCaps/WavCaps/Clotho数据集及AudioBench测试中，模型展现出对未见过指令的泛化响应能力。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练机制有效解耦表面词汇与语义，使单任务训练的音频模型具备零样本多指令跟随能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Method: 1. 利用发音特征空间解耦语音内容与说话者特征，增强转换鲁棒性；2. 集成可微分数字信号处理（DDSP）技术，直接从发音特征生成语音，降低声码处理延迟。

Result: 实验表明RT-VC在CPU上实现61.4毫秒延迟（较SOTA降低13.3%），同时保持与当前最优方法相当的语音合成质量。

Conclusion: RT-VC通过特征解耦与DDSP技术，成功平衡语音质量与实时性需求，为实时语音转换应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法提升语音识别器在少量无标签数据下的适应鲁棒性：使用基于完整假设的条件熵损失函数替代交叉熵，以及引入紧凑的说话者编码。实验显示在1分钟适应数据上词错率相对降低20%，10分钟数据达29%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别器在新说话者适应时面临两个主要挑战：适应数据量过少导致微调不鲁棒，且数据通常无标注。需要开发能在极少量无标签数据下稳定适应的新方法。

Method: 1) 提出条件熵损失函数：通过计算完整假设的条件熵替代单伪标签交叉熵，降低初始识别错误的影响；2) 设计低维说话者编码：用紧凑向量表征说话者特征，减少参数估计所需数据量。

Result: 在远场噪声增强版Common Voice数据集上，使用1分钟适应数据时词错率相对改进20%，当数据量增至10分钟时改进提升至29%。

Conclusion: 结合多假设条件熵和说话者编码的方法有效提升了小样本无监督适应的鲁棒性，证明利用完整假设分布和紧凑说话者表征在数据稀缺场景中的优势。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Result: 合成测试集在绝对系统性能评估（如得分计算）中存在显著偏差，但在相对性能比较（如系统排名）中偏差影响较小，模型分析进一步确认了偏差的存在。

Conclusion: 合成测试集可用于系统相对性能评估，但需警惕其在绝对性能评估中的偏差问题，未来应用需结合具体场景权衡利弊。

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的推荐系统矩阵补全方法存在对噪声边敏感、消息传递机制易导致过拟合的问题，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出MCCL框架：1) 提取交互的局部子图 2) 生成注意力机制驱动的去噪表示和变分自编码器对齐特征分布的表示 3) 通过互学习损失函数融合两种表示

Result: 在多个真实数据集上实现RMSE指标提升0.8%，排序指标最高提升36%，同时提高预测分数准确性和推荐排序质量

Conclusion: 通过对比学习框架融合不同视角的图结构表示能有效捕捉共性模式，显著提升推荐系统的泛化性能和预测准确性

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出LightKG，一种简化图神经网络的知识图谱推荐系统，通过标量对编码和线性聚合降低复杂度，结合高效对比学习，显著提升稀疏场景下的性能并减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的知识图谱推荐系统在稀疏交互场景下性能不足，复杂模型和注意力机制可能加剧学习难度。自监督学习虽被引入但延长训练时间，需寻求更高效的解决方案。

Method: LightKG采用简化GNN层：1) 将有向关系编码为标量对而非稠密嵌入 2) 线性聚合框架降低复杂度 3) 设计直接最小化节点相似性的对比层，避免传统SSL的子图生成耗时过程。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，LightKG平均推荐精度提升5.8%，训练时间减少84.3%，在稀疏/密集场景下均优于12个基线模型。

Conclusion: 简化GNN结构配合高效对比学习能有效解决知识图谱推荐中的稀疏性问题，证明模型设计应平衡复杂性与学习难度，而非单纯增加模型复杂度。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is
available at https://github.com/1371149/LightKG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LTV预测模型因依赖短期观察或强分布假设，存在长期价值低估和鲁棒性差的问题，需解决延迟支付、数据稀疏和异常值挑战。

Method: SHORE框架整合短期LTV预测作为辅助任务，采用保序多分类与动态Huber损失的混合损失函数，缓解零膨胀和异常值影响。

Result: 在线实验显示SHORE预测误差相对降低47.91%，离线与在线结果均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SHORE在工业级LTV预测中展现出高效性和鲁棒性，为游戏商业化策略提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Result: 在TREC DL和BEIR基准测试中，本方法显著优于传统点式方法，且效率相当；与高计算成本的对比方法相比达到竞争性效果。锚点构建策略的有效性通过进一步分析得到支持。

Conclusion: 通过全局对比锚点设计和后聚合机制，本研究在保持点式方法效率的同时解决了评分不一致问题，为大规模文档排序提供了高效且强效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Motivation: 明确AI如何有效增强人类创造力需系统性框架，现有研究对技术自主性与人类感知代理的交互机制缺乏清晰分类。

Method: 采用分布式创造力视角，通过技术自主性水平和感知代理程度两个维度，构建支持（工具）、协同（互补协作）、共生（认知融合）三种AI参与创造的模式。

Result: 不同模式对应不同创造力层次：支持模式适用于日常问题解决，协同模式促进增量创新，共生模式可能引发范式变革，同时需权衡伦理风险与系统设计。

Conclusion: 三维度模型为AI增强创造力提供了结构化分析框架，强调技术-人类动态交互对创新层级的影响，需在系统设计中平衡自主性与人类主体性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析2020年以来的30项研究，综述生成式AI（GAI）在促进社交互动中的应用设计、目标形式及评估方法，指出其支持动态个性化交互的潜力，但需关注公平性与包容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会联系减少威胁心理健康与福祉，而生成式AI技术（如大语言模型）被广泛用于增强社交体验，但其对社交互动的影响机制尚不明确。

Method: 采用范围综述方法，分析30项研究，识别应用领域（如叙事训练、协作学习）、设计方法（参与式/协同设计）及评估策略，同时考察社会文化偏见等伦理问题。

Result: 发现GAI在故事创作、情感技能训练等六大领域促进社交互动；参与式设计能提升技术有效性，但存在可访问性不足与文化偏见等伦理挑战。

Conclusion: GAI具备动态个性化交互潜力，但需强化公平设计实践与包容性评估策略，以平衡技术创新与社会伦理需求。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

### [312] [On feature selection in double-imbalanced data settings: a Random Forest approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10929)
*Fabio Demaria*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 针对高维分类任务中的双重不平衡问题（类别不平衡和维度不对称），本文提出了一种基于最小深度的新型特征选择阈值方案，通过利用随机森林的树结构评估变量重要性，实验证明其较传统方法更简洁、准确且可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机森林特征选择方法在双重不平衡（类别不平衡且样本量远大于特征数）场景下，易产生不稳定或误导性的变量重要性排序，亟需改进以适应此类复杂条件。

Method: 提出基于最小深度的阈值化特征选择方法，通过分析随机森林中决策树的拓扑结构（如变量在树中的分裂位置深度）来量化变量相关性，从而筛选关键特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统最小深度选择策略，能生成更精简、准确的特征子集，并在双重不平衡条件下保持稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为双重不平衡场景下的随机森林特征选择提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，显著提升了变量筛选的可靠性和模型解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

### [313] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Gittins指数在决策问题中的实际应用潜力，通过案例展示其在贝叶斯优化、队列尾部延迟优化等场景中的优异表现，挑战其仅具理论价值的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gittins指数虽能最优解决部分不确定性决策问题（如多臂老虎机、队列延迟优化），但其应用范围有限且定义复杂，常被视为理论工具。本文旨在证明其在实际问题中的有效应用价值。

Method: 通过案例驱动的方式引入Gittins指数，系统分析其在不同问题中的表现：包括可最优解的问题（如经典模型）及次优但高效的应用场景（如贝叶斯优化、尾部延迟优化）。

Result: Gittins指数在贝叶斯优化和队列尾部延迟最小化中展现出卓越性能（虽非最优解但接近），验证了其作为实用工具的可行性。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅是理论概念，更可作为实际决策问题的有效解法，未来需进一步扩展其应用边界并优化次优场景的表现。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出VQC-MLPNet混合量子-经典架构，通过量子电路动态生成经典MLP参数，克服变分量子电路的表达性限制与噪声敏感问题，理论证明其指数级表示能力提升，并通过实验验证噪声环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子电路（VQC）在量子机器学习中存在线性表达能力受限、优化困难及硬件噪声敏感等瓶颈，阻碍其实际应用。

Method: 结合量子电路与经典多层感知机（MLP），利用振幅编码和参数化量子操作动态生成MLP参数，增强模型表达能力和训练效率。

Result: 理论分析显示模型表示能力随量子比特数和电路深度呈指数提升，实验在量子点电荷态分类和基因组预测任务中验证了噪声环境下的性能优势。

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet为NISQ时代量子增强学习提供了理论可靠且实践鲁棒的框架，推动了非常规计算范式的量子-经典协同设计。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

### [315] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习（DRL）的个性化自适应质子治疗规划框架，通过自动调整优化优先级，显著提升头颈癌治疗计划质量，效果优于人工重新规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌调强质子治疗（IMPT）中解剖结构变化导致剂量分布偏移，传统人工重新规划耗时且资源密集，需开发高效自动化解决方案。

Method: 构建患者特异性DRL框架，使用增强解剖结构模拟肿瘤变化，以剂量体积直方图（DVH）为状态输入，22维动作空间调整优化权重，采用DQN和PPO算法最大化150分制临床评分。

Result: 在5例患者实际数据中，DRL（DQN/PPO）将初始计划从120.63分提升至139.78/142.74分，优于人工重新规划的137.20分，临床验证显示肿瘤覆盖与正常组织保护均改善。

Conclusion: DRL能有效解决质子治疗中的几何与剂量学复杂性，为离线自适应提供高效方案，并推动在线自适应质子治疗发展。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

### [316] [DUN-SRE: Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10309)
*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合时空旋转等变性的深度展开网络（DUN-SRE），用于动态MRI重建，通过建模时空对称性先验显著提升图像质量，尤其在心脏电影MRI中效果突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变卷积神经网络（ECNN）虽能利用空间对称性，但无法建模动态MRI中关键的时间对称性，导致重建性能受限。时间对称性作为动态MRI最普遍且信息丰富的结构先验，亟需被有效整合。

Method: 提出DUN-SRE网络：1) 通过(2+1)D等变卷积架构实现时空等变性；2) 将数据一致性模块与近端映射模块统一至深度展开框架；3) 设计高保真组滤波器参数化机制，平衡对称约束与表示精度。

Result: 在心脏CINE MRI数据集上，DUN-SRE在保留旋转对称结构方面达到SOTA性能，且对多种动态MRI任务展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE通过严格传播时空旋转对称约束，实现了对心脏运动动力学的物理精准建模，为动态MRI重建任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

*Cheng Wang,Siqi Chen,Donghua Mi,Yang Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yinsheng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型半监督学习框架SWDL-Net，通过结合拉普拉斯金字塔的边缘锐化与深度卷积上采样的细节增强，在仅2%标注数据的颅内出血分割任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内出血（ICH）医学图像标注成本高且耗时长，传统半监督学习方法依赖伪标签或一致性约束，难以充分捕捉病变细节与边界特征。

Method: SWDL-Net框架融合拉普拉斯金字塔的边界优化能力和深度卷积的细节特征映射，通过差异学习机制实现互补特征整合，提升小样本下的分割精度。

Result: 在271例ICH数据集上，2%标注数据时Dice系数达78.1%；BHSD公开数据集5%标注数据下性能同样超越现有最优方法，验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net通过多尺度特征互补机制有效缓解医学图像标注数据稀缺问题，为小样本半监督医学分割提供了新思路，代码与数据已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of

generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信噪比（SNR）和计算资源自适应的分布式CNN框架，通过智能遗传算法（LAIGA）优化网络配置，解决物联网设备在有限计算资源和低SNR条件下的图像分类问题。实验表明该方法在低信噪比和低计算预算下显著优于现有方案。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.
