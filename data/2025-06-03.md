Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PHYSICS数据集，包含16,568个高质量物理问题，覆盖五大领域和不同难度，旨在提升大语言模型在物理推理任务上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学和编程竞赛等高级推理任务上取得显著进展，但物理领域的研究和工业关注仍然有限。物理既是推理密集型学科，又对现实世界理解至关重要，因此需要更多关注。

Method: 通过精心设计的质量控制流程，从100多本教科书中筛选问题，构建PHYSICS数据集。数据集分为训练集和测试集，并为训练数据提供推理路径。此外，提出Rule+Model评估框架，以解决现有评估方法在物理领域的偏差问题。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的开源和专有模型在处理物理相关任务时存在局限性。PHYSICS数据集和评估方法有望共同推动大语言模型在物理领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced
reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile,
physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world
understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper
introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems
spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.
Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through
a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics
domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern
Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to
graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and
evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset
into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful
reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In
addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks
exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in
physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model
evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations
of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset
and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the
field of physics.

### [3] [From Mathematical Reasoning to Code: Generalization of Process Reward Models in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00027)
*Zhengyu Chen,Yudong Wang,Teng Xiao,Ruochen Zhou,Xuesheng Yang,Wei Wang,Zhifang Sui,Jingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了过程奖励模型（PRMs）在提升大型语言模型推理能力中的效果，探讨了训练方法、可扩展性和泛化能力，发现模型规模与计算成本需平衡，数据集多样性对性能有显著影响，并比较了不同测试时扩展策略的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索过程奖励模型（PRMs）如何通过结构化反馈机制解决中间错误，并评估其在复杂推理任务中的效率和准确性，尤其是在不同规模和数据集条件下的表现。

Method: 研究方法包括分析PRMs的训练方法、可扩展性和泛化能力，考察预训练与奖励模型训练FLOPs的相互作用，以及评估不同测试时扩展策略（如蒙特卡洛树搜索和Best-of-N采样）的效果。

Result: 研究结果显示，PRMs性能随规模增加呈现收益递减趋势，数据集多样性显著影响性能。数学数据集训练的PRMs在代码生成任务中表现出色，表明其具有跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结论指出，平衡模型规模与计算成本是关键，数据集多样性对PRMs性能至关重要。蒙特卡洛树搜索在资源充足时效果最佳，而Best-of-N采样适用于资源有限的情况。PRMs展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in
addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This
study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training
methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the
interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their
influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our
analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with
increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and
computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets
significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse
data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time
scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective
method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling
serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably,
our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit
performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust
cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that
PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying
patterns, further informing their optimization.

### [4] [Enhancing Tool Learning in Large Language Models with Hierarchical Error Checklists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00042)
*Yue Cui,Liuyi Yao,Shuchang Tao,Weijie Shi,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HiTEC框架，通过分层错误检查表和改进方法显著提升大语言模型工具调用的准确性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在工具调用时存在参数填充错误的问题，影响其效果。

Method: HiTEC框架采用全局和局部错误检查表，并提出HiTEC-ICL和HiTEC-KTO两种改进方法。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了参数填充准确性和工具调用成功率。

Conclusion: HiTEC框架有效诊断和缓解工具调用错误，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language
processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs.
However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling
during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error
Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate
tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC
introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies
common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets
tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose
two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and
HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global
checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational
interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates
high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based
optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and
tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

### [5] [Unraveling SITT: Social Influence Technique Taxonomy and Detection with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00061)
*Wiktoria Mieleszczenko-Kowszewicz,Beata Bajcar,Aleksander Szczęsny,Maciej Markiewicz,Jolanta Babiak,Berenika Dyczek,Przemysław Kazienko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含58种社会影响技术的分类框架SITT，并评估了LLMs识别这些技术的能力，发现现有模型表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是检测文本中微妙的社会影响形式，并评估大型语言模型（LLMs）识别这些形式的能力。

Method: 方法包括构建SITT数据集（包含746个对话，由11位专家标注），并使用分层多标签分类评估5种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等）。

Result: 结果显示，部分模型（如Claude 3.5）表现中等（类别F1分数为0.45），但整体性能有限，尤其是对上下文敏感的技术。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前LLMs对细微语言线索的敏感性有限，强调了领域特定微调的重要性。

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a
comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into
nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual
content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of
social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the
SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and
translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these
techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark
five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our
results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate
success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains
limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings
demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic
cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work
contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs
detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in
natural dialogues.

### [6] [Mis-prompt: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Proactive Error Handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00064)
*Jiayi Zeng,Yizhe Feng,Mengliang He,Wenhui Lei,Wei Zhang,Zeming Liu,Xiaoming Shi,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了主动错误处理的新挑战，并引入Mis-prompt基准测试，发现当前LLMs在此任务上表现不佳，但通过SFT可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有错误处理研究依赖显式指令，而现实场景中往往缺乏此类指令，因此需要探索无需显式指令的主动错误处理方法。

Method: 构建包含4个评估任务、错误分类体系和新数据集的Mis-prompt基准，并分析LLMs在主动错误处理上的表现。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs在主动错误处理任务上表现较差，但经过错误处理实例的SFT训练后性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 主动错误处理是LLMs亟待改进的方向，提出的基准和数据集将促进该领域研究，SFT被证明是有效提升手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner,
with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios,
explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper,
our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling
without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this
work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four
evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset.
Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and
the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on
proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs'
proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

### [7] [You Prefer This One, I Prefer Yours: Using Reference Words is Harder Than Vocabulary Words for Humans and Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00065)
*Dota Tianai Dong,Yifan Luo,Po-Ya Angela Wang,Asli Ozyurek,Paula Rubio-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多模态语言模型在词汇任务上接近人类水平，但在需要视角采择和空间推理的代词使用上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态语言模型在代词使用上的能力，填补现有研究中对这一常见但被忽视的语言现象的空白。

Method: 比较人类和七种先进多模态语言模型在词汇、物主代词和指示代词三类任务上的表现，分析其认知需求差异。

Result: 模型在词汇任务表现接近人类，但在物主代词和指示代词任务上存在显著缺陷，后者尤其难以通过提示工程改善。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统在需要语用学和社会认知能力的语法形式生成上仍面临明显挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like
ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked
despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap
by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive
demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and
demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven
state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty
hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task,
they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our
analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking
and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance
on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level
competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that
producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a
clear challenge in current NLP systems.

*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了13种先进大语言模型在巴基斯坦五种低资源语言中的政治偏见，发现模型普遍倾向西方自由左翼价值观，但在区域语言中呈现权威主义倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索大语言模型在非西方低资源多语言环境中的政治经济偏见，尤其是巴基斯坦五种主要语言背景下的表现。

Method: 采用结合定量（改编政治指南针测试）与定性（多层级框架分析）的新框架，针对11个巴基斯坦社会关键议题设计提示词进行测评。

Result: 结果显示模型整体呈现自由左翼倾向（反映西方训练数据影响），但区域语言中表现出向权威主义框架的显著偏移，且存在模型特异性偏见特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明亟需建立基于文化背景的多语言偏见审计框架，以应对大语言模型在多元文化语境中的意识形态表达差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet
their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and
low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource
languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We
propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test
(PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative
assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social
(libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through
content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by
aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani
society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left
values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts
toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural
modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures
and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings
show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing
frameworks.

*Robert Hankache,Kingsley Nketia Acheampong,Liang Song,Marek Brynda,Raad Khraishi,Greig A. Cowan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现大语言模型在多轮对话中性能显著下降，提出新基准测试并验证上下文策略可缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮问答任务，无法评估多轮交互对LLM性能的影响，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入系统性变化上下文量和类型的新基准，测试GPT/Claude/Gemini等模型对上下文变化的敏感性。

Result: 多轮交互中模型性能下降高达73%，GPT-4o准确率降低32%；任务描述的位置策略可提升3.5倍准确率。

Conclusion: 需开发鲁棒策略来设计和评估LLM，以应对上下文敏感性带来的性能波动问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to
understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks,
focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to
capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce
a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of
prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude,
and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual
variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice
questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance
drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as
GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative
performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable.
Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context
can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much
as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to
design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

*Edward Wang,Tianyu Wang,Avanti Athreya,Vince Lyzinski,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用交互式高斯混合模型（GMMs）作为大型语言模型（LLMs）的替代方案，用于研究人类行为，并比较了两种模型的动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽然强大，但计算复杂且昂贵。在社会科学研究中，当大规模实验不可行时，需要一种更高效的替代方法来模拟人类行为。

Method: 论文引入了交互式高斯混合模型（GMMs），并将其与依赖反馈的LLMs进行了实验模拟比较。

Result: 研究发现，交互式GMMs能够捕捉到交互式LLMs动态中的重要特征，并探讨了两种模型之间的关键相似性和差异性。

Conclusion: 论文总结了高斯混合模型的优势、可能的改进方向以及未来的研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match
human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on
the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social
sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale
experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally
expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a
simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose
updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that
interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting
LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting
LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture
models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

*Vincent Siu,Nicholas Crispino,Zihao Yu,Sam Pan,Zhun Wang,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMIC框架通过余弦相似度自动识别大语言模型中的拒绝行为方向，无需依赖预设模板或输出分析，提升模型安全行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预设拒绝模板或人工分析，难以有效识别大语言模型中的拒绝行为，尤其在对抗性或弱对齐模型中表现不足。

Method: 提出COSMIC框架，利用余弦相似度自动选择有效的拒绝行为方向和目标层，完全不依赖模型输出或预设假设。

Result: COSMIC在多种对齐条件下表现稳健，能有效引导模型转向更安全行为，同时保持较低的误拒绝率。

Conclusion: COSMIC为自动化识别和引导大语言模型行为提供了高效且通用的解决方案，尤其在对抗性和弱对齐场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their
activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant
challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates
detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce
\textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an
automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering
directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of
model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods
without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the
presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions
in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering
such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals,
demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出LinguaMaster框架和SwitchLingua数据集，解决多语言代码切换数据缺乏问题，并引入SAER评估指标提升ASR系统在代码切换场景下的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单语数据集无法满足多语言应用需求，且缺乏大规模、多样化的代码切换数据集，限制了多语言和跨文化研究的发展。

Method: 通过多智能体协作框架LinguaMaster合成多语言数据，构建包含42万文本样本和80小时音频的大规模多民族代码切换数据集SwitchLingua。

Result: SwitchLingua数据集覆盖12种语言和63种民族背景，并提出了结合语义信息的SAER评估指标，为多语言研究提供基础资源。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了代码切换数据集的空白，推动了多语言和跨文化研究的进展，同时提出的SAER指标提升了系统评估的准确性。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a
conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker
identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language
and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for
multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech
(CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the
inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual
mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a
large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent
collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable
multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate
\textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic
code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12
languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers
representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on
the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity,
offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural
research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation
metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the
\textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that
incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware
assessment of system performance.

TL;DR: 提出HD-NDEs方法，利用神经微分方程检测大语言模型幻觉问题，显著提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于分类的方法在序列早期或中期出现非事实信息时效果不佳，需改进幻觉检测的可靠性。

Method: 使用神经微分方程建模大语言模型潜在空间的动态系统，将潜在空间序列映射到分类空间进行真实性评估。

Result: 在五个数据集和六种大语言模型上验证，HD-NDEs在True-False数据集上AUC-ROC提升超过14%。

Conclusion: HD-NDEs能有效检测大语言模型的幻觉问题，尤其在序列早期和中期表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable
advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual
statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although
current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in
mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in
the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address
these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations
(HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of
statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space.
Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the
dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent
space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive
experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the
effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC
on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）新方法，通过生成式奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，解决了非可验证任务（如创意写作）中的奖励建模难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在可验证任务（如数学、代码生成）中表现优异，但在非可验证任务（如创意写作、开放对话）中因主观性评估和缺乏明确参考而存在局限性。现有方法依赖人工偏好的标量奖励模型，易出现泛化性差和奖励破解问题。

Method: 提出了一种统一的RLVR训练范式，结合基于写作原则的成对生成式奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，将主观评估转化为可验证奖励，并通过动态无参考的成对比较优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法（Writing-Zero）在无监督微调下显著提升了写作能力，对奖励破解具有强鲁棒性，并在内部和开源写作基准上取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为统一基于规则、参考和无参考的奖励建模提供了可能，为适用于所有语言任务的全面、可扩展的RL训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks
with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation.
However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative
writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently
subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these
domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences,
which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such
as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified
RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks
and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise
Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy
Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages
self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable,
verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise
comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from
within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop
robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by
Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to
reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method
achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing
benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based,
reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework,
thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm
applicable across all language tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDOH）时，大型语言模型（LLM）可能因表面线索产生虚假预测的问题，并提出了缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于提高从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDOH）的准确性，尤其是针对药物使用状态的提取，以避免模型因表面线索（如提及酒精或吸烟）而产生虚假预测，并揭示模型性能中的性别差异。

Method: 研究方法包括使用SHAC数据集的MIMIC部分，以药物状态提取为例，评估大型语言模型的性能，并测试提示工程和链式思考推理等缓解策略。

Result: 研究结果显示，提及酒精或吸烟会错误诱导模型预测当前/过去的药物使用，同时揭示了模型性能中的性别差异。通过提示工程和链式思考推理，可以有效减少这些假阳性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，通过特定的缓解策略可以显著提高大型语言模型在健康领域的可靠性，尤其是在处理社会健康决定因素时。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is
critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to
spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History
Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case
study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce
models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also
uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further
evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and
chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing
insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统缺乏个性化答案生成的训练和评估资源，导致该领域研究不足。

Method: 构建LaMP-QA基准，涵盖三大类问题，通过人工和自动评估对比个性化与非个性化模型表现。

Result: 使用个性化上下文可使性能提升高达39%，开源基准支持后续研究。

Conclusion: LaMP-QA填补了个性化问答评估的空白，证实个性化能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are
user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has
been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for
training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address
this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating
personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from
three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal
Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in
total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for
personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic
evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated
personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences.
Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized
approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs).
Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to
performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to
support future research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梵语因其音素复杂性和词连接处的语音转换，在自动语音识别（ASR）领域研究有限，尤其是在其诗歌韵律特征方面。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究引入了Vedavani系统，并构建了一个包含30,779个标记音频样本的54小时梵语ASR数据集，涵盖《梨俱吠陀》和《阿闼婆吠陀》的诗歌。

Result: 实验表明，在多种多语言语音模型中，IndicWhisper表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为梵语吠陀诗歌的ASR系统开发提供了首个全面数据集和基准测试，IndicWhisper模型展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents
unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic
complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures,
similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these
complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit,
particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by
intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the
question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly
one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we
introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic
poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779
labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset
captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language.
We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech
models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best
among the SOTA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在推理和说服能力上的进步，尤其是DeepSeek R1和V3模型的崛起，为基于LLM代理的社交推理游戏（如狼人杀）提供了更吸引人的体验。

Method: 提出了一种新颖且简单的基于LLM的狼人杀游戏系统，结合优化的文本转语音（TTS）模型，以增强与各种LLM模型的兼容性并提升用户参与度。

Result: 该系统通过优化的TTS模型和LLM的结合，显著提升了狼人杀游戏的用户体验和兼容性。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的不断增强，狼人杀游戏系统中额外的组件将变得不再必要。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: 研究发现部分遵从（提供通用信息但不含可操作细节）是最优拒绝策略，能显著改善用户体验，但当前LLM和奖励模型未能充分利用该策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对所有潜在有害查询一律拒绝，导致安全性与用户体验的权衡问题。本文旨在探索不同拒绝策略如何影响用户感知，并寻找最优解决方案。

Method: 通过480名参与者评估3,840个查询-响应对，分析9个前沿LLM的响应模式，并用6个奖励模型评估不同拒绝策略。

Result: 响应策略对用户体验影响显著（用户动机影响可忽略），部分遵从策略比直接拒绝减少50%以上负面感知，但现有模型自然部署该策略的比例极低且奖励模型低估其价值。

Conclusion: 有效的AI安全机制应聚焦于设计深思熟虑的拒绝策略而非意图检测，部分遵从策略为实现安全性与用户持续参与的双赢提供路径。

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries
regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff
between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants
evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal
strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings
reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user
motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general
information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy,
reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals.
Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and
evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating
that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models
currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails
require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent,
offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and
sustained user engagement.

TL;DR: 轻量级模型在结构化放射学报告中表现优于大型语言模型，且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告缺乏标准化格式，影响临床决策和机器学习应用，大型语言模型虽强但存在计算成本高、隐私问题等限制。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器-解码器模型（T5和BERT2BERT）处理MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus数据集，并与8种开源大型语言模型进行对比。

Result: 轻量级模型在人工标注测试集上优于基于提示技术的大型模型，部分大型模型虽有提升但计算资源消耗显著增加。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型是资源受限医疗环境中结构化临床文本的可持续且保护隐私的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a
standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning
(ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational
requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder
models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring
radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark
these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix
prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted
using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some
LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the
Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%,
GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of
substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B
incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions
compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of
lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving
solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare
settings.

TL;DR: AST-FIM提出了一种基于抽象语法树的代码填充预训练方法，相比传统随机字符掩码方法，在真实代码编辑任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码大语言模型将代码视为纯文本并随机掩码字符，无法有效捕捉代码结构。作者希望利用AST实现语法结构感知的掩码策略。

Method: 提出AST-FIM方法：通过抽象语法树识别完整语法结构（如代码块、表达式、函数）进行掩码，并构建Real-FIM-Eval基准（含12种语言的3万+GitHub提交）。

Result: 在1B/8B参数模型上，AST-FIM比随机字符掩码方法在标准FIM基准上最高提升5个点，特别适合真实代码编辑场景。

Conclusion: 基于语法结构的掩码策略能更有效学习通用代码模式，AST-FIM为代码补全任务提供了新方向。

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where
models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs
treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and
evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent
training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code
editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate
real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce
Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12
languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show
that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it
outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM
benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公司产品线的扩展，意图分类面临意图数量增加和分类体系变化的可扩展性挑战，需要一种无需频繁重新训练的高效分类方法。

Method: REIC采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，动态整合相关知识，实现精确的意图分类。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，REIC在大规模客户服务场景中优于传统的微调、零样本和少样本方法。

Conclusion: REIC在域内和域外场景中均表现出色，展示了其在实际大规模意图分类系统中的部署潜力。

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer
service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while
reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand
their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to
the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different
verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation
Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges
effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically
incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the
need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning,
zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our
results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive
and large-scale intent classification systems.

TL;DR: ComposeRAG提出模块化RAG架构，通过分解核心功能并加入自反思机制，显著提升多跳问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统常采用紧耦合的单体设计，限制了可解释性、系统评估和针对性改进，尤其是在复杂多跳问答场景中。

Method: 将RAG流程分解为原子化可组合模块（如问题分解、查询重写等），每个模块作为参数化转换单元独立运作，并引入验证失败时的自反思迭代机制。

Result: 在四个多跳QA基准测试中，准确率最高比微调方法提升15%，比专业推理流程提升5%；在低质量检索环境下减少10%以上无依据答案。

Conclusion: 模块化设计实现了灵活透明的高性能多跳推理，验证优先策略显著提升结果可信度，各组件贡献通过消融实验得到验证。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet
many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like
query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their
interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially
for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel
modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable
modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting,
Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized
transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent
implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in
multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that
iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure.
Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity.
Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over
fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized
pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG
significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces
ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by
approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies
validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive
contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's
capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing
multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统要么依赖任务特定模型（适应性有限），要么依赖未与专业知识和工具结合的通才语言模型，无法满足复杂医疗决策需求。

Method: 采用模块化、基于代理的架构MedOrch，灵活整合领域专用工具，并确保透明可追溯的推理过程。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病诊断（93.26%准确率）、胸片分析（宏AUC 61.2%）和多模态问答（54.47%准确率）等任务中显著超越基线。

Conclusion: MedOrch通过推理驱动的工具协同，展现了处理多模态医疗数据和支撑复杂临床认知任务的潜力。

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for
Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge
sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI
systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited
adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized
external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that
orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide
comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based
architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools
without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and
traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each
intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch
across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,
chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using
authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive
performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the
state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting
Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a
significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior
performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover,
in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves
an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance
healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal
medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide
range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their
reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in
low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice
Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and
English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including
general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and
chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general
models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving
83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models
such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often
struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also
analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is
generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural
and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is
insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language
adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and
culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be

TL;DR: 研究发现，对齐的语言模型在隐性偏见测试中表现出更强的偏见，原因是早期表示忽略了种族概念。提出新方法通过增强早期层对种族概念的表示来减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐的语言模型在显性偏见评估中表现无偏，但在隐性关联任务中却显示出刻板印象，这引发了对其公平使用的担忧。研究旨在揭示这种差异背后的机制。

Method: 通过分析模型内部表示，发现对齐模型在模糊上下文中忽略了种族概念。提出一种新方法，激励模型在早期层表示种族概念以减轻偏见。

Result: 对齐模型在早期表示中忽略种族概念，导致隐性偏见被放大。新方法通过增强种族概念的表示，有效减少了隐性偏见。

Conclusion: 忽视种族概念会无意中延续语言模型的隐性偏见。通过增强早期层对种族概念的表示，可以有效减少这种偏见。

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias
evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks,
raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind
this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias
in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their
unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal
representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely
fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by
this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by
incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers.
In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our
interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts
effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans,
ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在招聘过程中使用大语言模型（LLM）时，即使候选人其他条件相同，披露残疾信息的候选人比未披露或明确表示无残疾的候选人更少被选中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）越来越多地应用于招聘流程，公平性问题日益突出。尽管公司收集人口统计信息以支持多样性倡议，但将这些信息（尤其是残疾信息）提供给LLM可能引发偏见。现有研究较少探讨自愿披露信息对LLM驱动候选人选择的具体影响。

Method: 研究比较了在性别、种族、资历等条件完全相同的情况下，披露残疾信息、未披露或明确表示无残疾的候选人在LLM筛选中的结果差异，选择的职位（如收银员、软件开发人员）在残疾与非残疾人群中的就业率差距较小。

Result: LLM更倾向于选择明确表示无残疾的候选人；即使候选人不披露残疾状态，其被选中的概率仍低于明确表示无残疾的候选人。

Conclusion: LLM在招聘筛选中存在对残疾信息的潜在偏见，需进一步优化模型公平性以避免歧视性结果。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring
processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for
jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including
gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to
support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs,
especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential
biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how
disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the
specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate
selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared
identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought
jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without
disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored
candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where
candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less
likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have
a disability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiHoax基准，评估大语言模型在复杂多步推理中处理错误前提的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的应用增加，其检测错误假设和进行批判性推理的能力对确保输出可靠性至关重要。现有基准仅关注单跳错误前提问题，而现实推理常需多步验证。

Method: 构建MultiHoax基准数据集，涵盖7个国家、10个知识类别，以维基百科为知识源，测试模型在多跳推理中识别错误前提的能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的大语言模型在不同国家、知识类别和多跳推理类型中均难以有效检测错误前提。

Conclusion: 研究强调需提升大语言模型的错误前提检测能力和多步推理鲁棒性，MultiHoax为相关评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for
ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important
evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect
responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world
reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify
consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on
surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step
reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge
categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual
reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge
categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved
false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

Abstract: The success of large language models has driven interest in developing
similar speech processing capabilities. However, a key challenge is the
scarcity of high-quality spontaneous speech data, as most existing datasets
contain scripted dialogues. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for
eliciting and recording natural dialogues and release our Stage 1 dataset with
200+ hours of spontaneous speech. Our approach fosters fluid, natural
conversations while encouraging a diverse range of topics and interactive
exchanges. Unlike traditional methods, it facilitates genuine interactions,
providing a reproducible framework for future data collection. This paper
introduces our dataset and methodology, laying the groundwork for addressing
the shortage of spontaneous speech data. We plan to expand this dataset in
future stages, offering a growing resource for the research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的主题建模和聚类方法存在扩展性差、相似性度量不透明以及在多语言环境下表现不佳的问题。

Method: 首先训练多语言Matryoshka嵌入模型，能够根据不同维度的子集确定故事相似性的不同粒度；然后开发高效的层次聚类算法，利用嵌入的层次性识别独特的新闻故事、叙事和主题。

Result: 嵌入模型在SemEval 2022 Task 8测试数据集上达到了最先进的性能（Pearson ρ = 0.816），并能有效聚类真实世界新闻数据集中的故事、叙事和主题。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言环境下表现出色，能够高效且可解释地聚类新闻和社交媒体数据，识别不同层次的故事和主题。

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for
topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly,
rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In
this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and
multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do
this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine
story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the
dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson
$\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering
algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to
identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by
illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and
overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在持续预训练中加入英语数据虽不影响验证困惑度，但对目标语言的下游能力至关重要。未加入英语会导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型泛化能力。提出课程学习和权重指数移动平均作为替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在持续预训练（CPT）中，英语数据对目标语言模型适应性的作用，此前这一角色的影响尚未被深入研究。

Method: 引入语言无关的上下文学习基准，评估英语数据在CPT中的影响，并提出课程学习和权重指数移动平均（EMA）作为改进方法。

Result: 未加入英语数据会导致早期灾难性遗忘，损害模型在目标语言下游任务中的泛化能力。课程学习和EMA能有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了英语数据在CPT中对新兴能力涌现的关键作用，为未来设计更有效的语言适应方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large
language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice
to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been
carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does
not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of
downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a
language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals
catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn
damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the
target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in
terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in
the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning
and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to
mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the
dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language
adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in
the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决连续扩散语言模型在生成序列时需要多次迭代的问题，通过一步生成提高效率。

Method: 通过将学生模型输出在连续词嵌入空间中的分数与预训练教师模型的分数函数对齐，实现一步生成。

Result: 实验表明，DLM-One在推理时间上实现了高达500倍的加速，同时在文本生成任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 一步扩散为高效、高质量的语言生成提供了新方向，推动了连续扩散模型在自然语言处理中的广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for
one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs).
DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of
a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the
score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can
achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through
comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we
show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while
maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to
evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior
across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and
practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a
promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader
adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for
natural language processing.

*Payal Mohapatra,Akash Pandey,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型EMG适配器模块，将无声EMG信号映射到大型语言模型的输入空间，显著提升了无声EMG到文本转换的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要有声和无声EMG信号及语音数据的配对，这对无法发声的人群不实用。论文探索了大型语言模型在理解无声语音方面的潜力。

Method: 提出EMG适配器模块，将EMG特征映射到大型语言模型的输入空间，仅使用无声EMG数据进行学习。

Result: 在封闭词汇的无声EMG到文本任务中，平均词错误率为0.49；仅用六分钟数据，性能比专用模型提升近20%。

Conclusion: 该研究是让大型语言模型理解无声EMG信号的重要第一步，为无声语音识别开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for
individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on
paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text
conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of
large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential
to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of
learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that
maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error
rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with
a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves
performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown
to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding
articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work
takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech
using surface EMG.

*John Harvill,Ziwei Fan,Hao Wang,Yizhou Sun,Hao Ding,Luke Huan,Anoop Deoras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务无关的无损提示压缩技术，平均减少输入token序列长度27%和18%，同时保留完整语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型提示压缩方法多为有损压缩，可能丢失语义信息。本文旨在开发一种无损压缩技术，严格保留语义/语法。

Method: 采用类似LZ77的无损压缩技术，通过变换token序列实现压缩，且过程可逆。基于Transformer架构的计算量减少与注意力机制平方复杂度相关。

Result: 在两个需要严格保留语义的任务上，压缩后输入token序列长度平均减少27%和18%，对应计算量减少47%和33%。性能损失很小，且可能通过更大模型消除。

Conclusion: 无损压缩技术在严格语义保留场景优于有损方法，性能接近原始输入，计算效率显著提升。模型规模扩大可能完全消除性能差距。

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses
on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information
that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence
length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression
technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token
sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks
explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\%
and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature
of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and
highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our
proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of
semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods
perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique
produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed
input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would
likely erase the gap entirely.

*Brendan Sands,Yining Wang,Chenhao Xu,Yuxuan Zhou,Lai Wei,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和Gemini-2.0三种大语言模型生成电影评论的能力，发现它们在语法和结构上表现良好，但在情感丰富度和风格一致性上仍有不足。DeepSeek-V3表现最均衡，GPT-4o偏积极，Gemini-2.0偏负面但情感过强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型（LLMs）在生成电影评论方面的适用性，并与IMDb用户评论进行比较，以评估其生成质量及潜在改进空间。

Method: 使用电影字幕和剧本作为输入，通过三种LLMs（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和Gemini-2.0）生成评论，并从词汇、情感极性、相似性和主题一致性等方面与IMDb用户评论对比分析。

Result: LLMs能生成语法流畅、结构完整的评论，但在情感丰富度和风格一致性上与IMDb评论存在差距。DeepSeek-V3表现最接近IMDb评论，GPT-4o过于积极，Gemini-2.0负面情感捕捉较好但情感强度过高。

Conclusion: LLMs在电影评论生成上已具备一定能力，但需进一步优化以提升情感表达和风格一致性，尤其是平衡情感强度和多样性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including
text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation
of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of
movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie
reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate
their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We
use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how
they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie
reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic
consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that
LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete
movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional
richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews,
suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of
movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants
were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show
that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews.
We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching
IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0
captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

TL;DR: SkillVerse是一个无监督的树状诊断框架，用于评估语言模型在特定技能上的熟练程度，并通过树搜索算法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理复杂任务的能力增强，需要更精细的评估方法来理解模型的具体能力，以指导模型开发。

Method: SkillVerse利用LLM作为评判者，首先分析模型响应，然后将其组织成层次化的树状结构（dendrogram），从而灵活地评估模型在不同粒度上的能力。

Result: SkillVerse在两项下游任务中表现优异：1）通过树搜索算法选择更有效的少样本示例，将模型的上下文学习能力提升了25%；2）预测模型弱点的准确率达到55%，比未使用SkillVerse时高出22%。

Conclusion: SkillVerse提供了一种灵活且有效的方法来评估和提升语言模型的特定技能，为模型开发提供了有价值的洞察。

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their
evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific
understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed
model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an
unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model
proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first
critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical
structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of
granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern
large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1)
improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to
select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting
new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without
SkillVerse.

Motivation: 现有迭代自适应检索方法因推理错误和检索结果偏差导致性能受限，需改进以应对复杂问题。

Method: TreeRare利用语法树自底向上遍历，生成子查询并检索相关段落，合成上下文感知证据后聚合答案。

Result: 在五个涉及模糊或多跳推理的问答数据集上，TreeRare显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TreeRare通过结构化检索与推理机制，为复杂知识密集型问答提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive,
requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of
the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and
adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their
reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex,
knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval
frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned
retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax
Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to
guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the
principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a
bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries
and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A
subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into
concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence
across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question
answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that
TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 当前缺乏公开的、标注过的语码混合语料库，难以支持自然多语言对话及关系建模的研究需求。

Method: 通过持续收集、验证并结构化处理社交媒体等场景的语码混合消息，构建JSON格式数据集，附带元数据和语言统计信息。

Result: 已建成包含355,641条消息的语料库，主要涵盖英语、普通话等语言的混合模式。

Conclusion: Codemix语料库将为计算语言学、社会语言学及NLP应用提供基础数据集，同时遵循严格的隐私与伦理标准。

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from
multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual
communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as
social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a
lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for
modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first
labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context
while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will
continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a
structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata
and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning
various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and
other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational
dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP
applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)如何利用上下文信息推理他人情绪状态，发现LLMs具有一定推理能力，但在关联情境结果与特定情绪方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别数据集通常依赖显性线索，而文本中可能包含需要高阶推理的隐性上下文线索。研究旨在探索LLMs在心理理论框架下如何利用这些线索进行情绪推理。

Method: 基于认知评估理论，构建了专门的心理理论评估数据集，评估LLMs从前提到情绪的正向推理和从情绪反推情境的逆向推理能力。

Result: 研究表明LLMs具有一定程度的情绪推理能力，但在将情境结果和评估与特定情绪关联方面表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调在LLMs的情绪推理训练和评估中需要融入心理学理论，以提高其理解复杂情感线索的能力。

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that
can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one
challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich
in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer
emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond
surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models
(LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information,
within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal
Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward
reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to
inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although
they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific
emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the
training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OWSM项目虽然开发了一系列完全开放的语音基础模型，但其训练数据仍然不足。为了增强模型性能，需要整合大规模、多样化的数据集。

Method: 通过整合YODAS数据集，并开发一个可扩展的数据清洗流程，解决了数据中的语言标签错误和音频-文本不对齐问题，最终生成了一个包含166,000小时语音、覆盖75种语言的数据集。

Result: 新训练的OWSM v4模型在多语言基准测试中显著优于之前的版本，并在多个场景中匹配或超越了Whisper和MMS等工业前沿模型。

Conclusion: 通过整合和清洗大规模数据集，OWSM v4模型在性能上取得了显著提升，展示了开放学术资源在语音模型领域的潜力。

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of
fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their
training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating
YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license.
However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which
introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text
misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline
using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across
75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset
alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on
multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial
models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the
cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the
ESPnet toolkit.

Result: 实验表明，LSC在多种LLM和数据集上显著提高了计算效率，同时保持或超越了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: LSC是一种高效且上下文敏感的语义聚类方法，为LLM的测试时计算扩展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or
sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for
improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as
evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A
key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ
in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of
the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant
exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on
external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often
fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering
(LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator
LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external
models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that
LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling
while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant
challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We
introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic
content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our
approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural
signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates
continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible
method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables
unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with
as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art
method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for
practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding
technologies.

Motivation: 标准化病人模拟成本高且不灵活，现有虚拟患者系统缺乏对学员沟通技能的适应性调整能力。

Method: 基于大语言模型构建临床场景，实时评估学员沟通并调整虚拟患者反应，确保学习安全性。

Result: 自动化评估显示框架能反映真实沟通水平，专家确认其交互比现有方法更自然真实。

Conclusion: Adaptive-VP具有作为可扩展护理沟通培训工具的潜力。

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for
high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide
valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual
patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to
the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees
respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become
uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely
unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue
generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically
adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for
constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system
for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time,
while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating
challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from
practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism
reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that
Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for
nursing communication training.

*Ge Qu,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Xiaolong Li,Nan Huo,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHARE提出了一种基于SLM的分层动作校正助手，通过将SQL查询转化为逐步动作轨迹并分两阶段细化，有效提升LLMs在文本到SQL任务中的自我校正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL的自校正方法存在两个主要问题：递归调用导致计算开销大，以及LLMs难以有效检测和修正声明式SQL查询的错误。

Method: SHARE采用三个专用SLM的序列化流程，先将SQL查询转化为逐步动作轨迹以揭示底层推理，再进行两阶段细粒度校正，并提出分层自进化策略进行数据高效训练。

Result: 实验表明SHARE显著增强了自校正能力，且在不同LLMs上表现鲁棒，在低资源训练场景下仍保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: SHARE为数据隐私受限的文本到SQL应用提供了高效解决方案，通过分层校正框架突破了传统自校正方法的局限性。

Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical
limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive
self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2)
LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for
declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning
path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action
corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error
localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized
Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first
transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that
reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We
further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient
training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances
self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs.
Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong
performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly
valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

*Jiawei Gu,Shangsong Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SRM的即插即用框架，通过外部奖励分配和推测验证机制，在保持决策效果的同时显著降低LLM的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型(LLM)决策方法过于注重性能而忽视计算成本效益平衡，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出Speculative Reward Model(SRM)框架，包含外部奖励分配器和推测验证机制，减少对LLM内部评估的依赖并优化搜索路径。

Result: 实验表明SRM在数学推理、规划等复杂任务中能将搜索框架成本降至1/10，同时保持决策有效性。

Conclusion: SRM框架成功实现了LLM决策效率与效果的平衡，为复杂任务处理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for
handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance
but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To
address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the
cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often
trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM
decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward
Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing
search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to
predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation.
And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices
and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several
complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and
numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM
reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while
maintaining effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TSGD-M方法，通过基于历史批次分布重新加权提示采样，优化文本梯度下降框架，在多个NLP任务中表现优于传统TGD方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示在大语言模型中的作用日益关键，优化文本提示成为重要挑战。传统TGD方法在数据规模增加时性能先升后降，且计算成本显著增加。

Method: 受数值梯度下降启发，提出TSGD-M方法，通过重新加权提示采样实现可扩展的上下文学习。

Result: 在涵盖BIG-Bench Hard等九个NLP任务的实验中，TSGD-M显著优于不采用重新加权采样的TGD基线，并降低了大多数任务的方差。

Conclusion: TSGD-M是一种高效且可扩展的文本提示优化方法，能有效提升大语言模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models
(LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual
Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven
approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates
(or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially
improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP
tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also
significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address
this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual
Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates
scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch
distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including
BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks
- TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate
reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文通过因果结构发现和量化方法，分析了儿童语音识别中生理、认知和外部因素的相互影响，并评估了微调模型对这些因素的缓解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音识别（ASR）表现通常不如成人，现有方法孤立分析影响因素，忽略了因素间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 引入因果结构发现方法解析生理、认知和外部因素的相互依赖关系，并通过因果量化评估各因素对儿童ASR的影响。

Result: 实验表明，微调模型能缓解部分因素（如发音技能），但其他因素（如生理差异）影响依然显著。

Conclusion: 因果分析方法揭示了儿童ASR中复杂因素的相互作用，为改进模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to
that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological
(e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation),
and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing
analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting
interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and
indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal
structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among
physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ
causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We
extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are
mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on
Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across
different ASR systems.

*Daniel Israel,Guy Van den Broeck,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出自适应并行解码（APD）方法，动态调整并行采样的token数量，以在扩散大语言模型中实现高吞吐量且质量损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是LLM生成速度的瓶颈，而扩散大语言模型（dLLM）理论上支持并行生成，但实践中难以在不牺牲质量的情况下达到自回归模型的速度。

Method: 引入自适应并行解码（APD），通过定义dLLM边缘概率与小型辅助自回归模型序列联合概率的乘法混合，动态调整并行采样的token数量。优化包括启用KV缓存和限制掩码输入大小。

Result: APD在下游基准测试中显著提高了吞吐量，同时质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APD通过三个可调参数灵活权衡吞吐量和质量，为并行token生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding,
where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion
large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token
generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive
models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce
adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the
number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a
multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint
probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This
inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample
from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We
further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked
input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly
tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher
throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于困惑度的噪声标注检测方法在高噪声比例下失效，因为假设噪声样本困惑度更高不成立。

Method: 引入双去偏框架，利用合成邻居显式校正困惑度估计，生成鲁棒的样本清洁度评分。

Result: 实验表明该方法噪声检测能力优越，ICL性能接近全清洁标注集，且在高噪声下仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架突破了传统困惑度方法的局限，为噪声环境下的上下文学习提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn
from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by
ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher
perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks
down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We
reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy
annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation
itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models
(LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that
uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding
a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample
cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that
its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration
corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are
extremely high.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型多模态对话模型，通过引入视觉和听觉输入，使聊天机器人能进行更自然的长期多轮对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态聊天机器人主要关注视觉任务，忽略了听觉输入，且交互多为静态讨论而非自然对话。研究旨在填补这一空白，实现更沉浸式的多模态对话。

Method: 研究团队构建了多模态多会话多方对话数据集（M3C），并开发了具有多模态记忆检索功能的新型对话模型。

Result: 人类评估表明，该模型在复杂场景下能有效处理视听输入，保持连贯动态的交互，展现了先进多模态对话代理的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究通过整合视听模态和记忆机制，显著提升了聊天机器人在自然对话中的多模态交互能力。

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions,
multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far,
efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on
image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,
placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears",
namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static
interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally
incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of
simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been
explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific
constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural
conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots
with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As
part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,
Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel
multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,
trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in
long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like
settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and
respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong
performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its
potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

TL;DR: DYNAC是一种基于动态词汇的非自回归上下文偏置方法，通过自条件CTC在中间层整合动态词汇，显著提升推理速度同时保持识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态词汇方法在自回归模型中虽能提升上下文偏置准确率，但推理速度慢；而在非自回归模型（如CTC）中，条件独立性假设导致静态与动态词汇间依赖关系缺失。

Method: 提出DYNAC方法，将动态词汇作为自条件信号整合到CTC编码器的中间层，有效建模静态与动态词汇间的依赖关系。

Result: 实验显示DYNAC在LibriSpeech测试集上实现81%的实时因子降低，词错误率仅增加0.1个百分点。

Conclusion: DYNAC在保持精度的前提下大幅提升推理效率，为动态词汇在非自回归模型中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and
unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which
represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models.
This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic
vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as
connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence
assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens.
This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a
self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into
intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC
effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while
reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC
reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the
LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成的问答系统难以处理多答案问题，需要新的方法提高答案召回率和准确性。

Method: RI$^2$VER框架分两阶段：独立阅读生成候选答案，跨段落验证（包括验证问题生成、补充证据收集和跨段落合成验证）过滤噪声。

Result: 在QAMPARI和RoMQA数据集上平均F1分数提升11.17%，特别擅长需要多证据合成的问题。

Conclusion: 跨段落验证机制有效提升多答案问答性能，框架对不同规模模型均具有普适性。

Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid
answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented
generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then
synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent
Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a
large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an
initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage
verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1)
Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3)
Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA
datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement
of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification
pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions
requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts
based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have
introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models'
generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via
simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1)
general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different
scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in
specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning
processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which
potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the
generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a
General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning
processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage,
we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into
anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is
able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific
learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via
either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that
G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of
patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical
decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical
domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain
hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further
complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of
hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two
datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by
systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated
content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising
organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain
detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on
fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on
natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count
hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods.
Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled
hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical
hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics
supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical
summarization systems.

pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data
mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training
with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7

Conclusion: PVP数据集填补了研究空白，推动了基于AI的个性化视觉说服系统的发展。

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and
behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political
communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is
growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate
persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in
this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness
of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images.
To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized
visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset,
comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion
strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of
images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and
psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate
the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an
automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal
that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and
evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized
visual persuasion.

multi-hop reasoning in LLMs. Building on the PatchScopes framework, Auto-Patch
selectively modifies internal representations using a learned classifier.
Evaluated on the MuSiQue dataset, Auto-Patch improves the solve rate from
18.45\% (baseline) to 23.63~$\pm$~0.7\% (3 runs), narrowing the gap to
Chain-of-Thought prompting (27.44\%). Our results highlight the potential of
dynamic hidden state interventions for advancing complex reasoning in LLMs.

*Shuguo Hu,Jun Hu,Huaiwen Zhang*

TL;DR: 提出GLPN-LLM模型，通过标签传播技术整合LLM生成的伪标签，提升多模态假新闻检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的伪标签在假新闻检测中表现不佳，需探索有效整合方法。

Method: 设计全局标签传播网络（GLPN-LLM），采用掩码机制防止训练时标签泄漏。

Result: 在基准数据集上超越现有最优方法，验证了LLM与标签传播的协同有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM与标签传播技术，显著提升了多模态假新闻检测的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by
predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone
demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making
their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label
Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal
fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation
techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo
labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among
all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to
prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not
propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our
model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设存在人工标注的示例池，但低资源语言难以满足这一假设，因此需要探索不依赖外部资源的示例生成方法。

Method: 提出DAT方法，基于相关性和多样性标准生成示例对，无需外部资源支持。

Result: 实验表明，DAT在低资源语言上优于基线方法，并能通过累积生成对构建可复用的示例池。

Conclusion: DAT为低资源语言的机器翻译提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with
only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples
has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these
studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated
pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an
assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper
explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine
translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for
Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs
without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior
criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work
as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and
analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we
show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating
generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated
strong advantages in addressing complex real-world tasks. However, due to the
introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to
misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of
misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce
MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to
evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose
ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware
reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows.
Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS
exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an
average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and
improving task success rates under attack by approximately 10.33%. Our code and

TL;DR: 该论文通过系统评估常识生成中的多样性指标，发现基于内容的指标优于基于形式的指标，并建议未来研究采用基于内容的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前常识生成任务中，评估生成多样性的指标众多，但缺乏明确的标准来确定哪些指标最适合评估多样性。

Method: 作者进行了多样性指标的系统元评估，使用大型语言模型（LLM）创建标注数据集，并对比基于形式和基于内容的多样性指标。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于内容的多样性指标与LLM评分高度相关，优于基于形式的指标。

Conclusion: 建议未来常识生成研究采用基于内容的指标来评估输出多样性。

Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must
generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing
multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and
content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the
diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to
which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense
generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of
diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity
metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where
even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We
then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for
the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use
it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics.
Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics
consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations
with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense
generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of
their outputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出CausalAbstain方法，通过因果视角帮助LLMs在多语言场景中更准确地选择反馈并提升弃权决策效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在不同语言间存在知识差异，当前多语言弃权策略依赖生成反馈和自省，但易受反馈不准确和偏见影响。

Method: 提出CausalAbstain方法，从因果视角帮助LLMs决定是否利用多个生成反馈并识别最有用的反馈。

Result: 实验表明，CausalAbstain在原生语言和多语言设置中能有效选择有用反馈并提升弃权决策，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CausalAbstain通过因果分析提升了LLMs在多语言场景中的弃权决策能力，具有可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across
languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps
is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings.
Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on
generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing
self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by
inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a
causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps
LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how
to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances
abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language
(\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings,
outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic
and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识产权领域的RAG系统常因用户查询的多样性（如口语化表达、拼写错误和术语模糊）导致检索不准确和响应不佳。

Method: 采用轻量级Data-to-Tune范式，结合提示工程化查询生成和硬负例挖掘，优化检索模型的语义对齐能力。

Result: 在台湾专利问答数据集上，检索准确率提升185.62%（专利咨询）和262.26%（新技术报告），生成质量分别提升14.22%和53.58%。

Conclusion: MQG-RFM通过语义感知的检索优化弥合用户意图与系统理解间的差距，为中小机构提供实用、可扩展的专利智能解决方案，已被中国最大科研社交平台ScholarMate采用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property
(IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial
expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate
retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose
Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a
novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied
user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent
but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural
modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining
prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance
retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental
results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval
accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the
Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in
generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap
between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval
optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid,
cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking
reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has
already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social
networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文知识编辑方法未明确区分新注入知识与模型原有推理过程，导致外部更新与内部参数知识冲突，影响推理一致性和准确性。

Method: DecKER框架首先生成掩码推理路径，然后通过混合检索和基于模型的验证解决知识编辑问题，实现推理与知识编辑的解耦。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，DecKER显著优于现有上下文知识编辑方法，有效缓解知识冲突并保持推理一致性。

Conclusion: DecKER通过解耦推理与知识编辑，为大型语言模型的知识更新提供了一种高效且一致的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by
modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among
knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight
solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving
model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly
separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning
process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates
and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of
the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine
how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the
model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that
naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often
leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end,
we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from
knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving
knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on
multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE
methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARIA方法通过将自然语言动作从高维标记分布空间映射到低维意图空间，减少奖励方差，提升语言智能体训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放式语言动作环境中，动作空间的高维性导致奖励稀疏和方差大，阻碍强化学习效果。

Method: 提出ARIA方法，将动作投影到低维意图空间，聚类语义相似动作并共享奖励，从而降低奖励方差。

Result: ARIA显著降低策略梯度方差，在四项下游任务中平均性能提升9.95%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ARIA通过意图空间奖励聚合，有效解决了高维动作空间下的强化学习难题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning
and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in
open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking
games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens,
resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a
space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance,
hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose
ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient
and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language
actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a
low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are
clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation
reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only
significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial
performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks,
consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both
domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack
domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and
face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To
address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional,
multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also
incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a
multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight
modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across
domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary
evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and
summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment
of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: AnnaAgent通过动态情感控制和跨会话记忆，显著提升了AI心理辅导中求助者模拟的真实性。

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in
AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents
(CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios,
to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving
more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:
dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often
fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To
address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent
system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion
modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,
enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its
tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term
memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,
demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in
psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed

Conclusion: 该研究为在线交流和表情符号审核提供了细致见解，提出的方法在平衡内容安全和语义保留方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they
also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity.
While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense,
the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains
underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire
harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse.
In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive
Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and
how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered,
multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while
preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach
effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our
analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering
nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

Result: Entriever在知识检索任务中显著优于基线模型，并在半监督对话系统中提升端到端性能。

Conclusion: Entriever通过能量函数统一建模知识相关性，有效提升检索质量及下游任务表现。

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base
given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog
systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems,
when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and
correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to
be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this
issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly
models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the
knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy
function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different
training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially
outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks.
Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded
dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge
pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

Motivation: 合同审查复杂耗时，需法律专业知识，且合同通常保密，限制了专有模型的使用，需依赖开源方案。

Method: PAKTON采用协作智能体工作流和新型检索增强生成（RAG）组件，处理合同分析的复杂性。

Result: 实验表明，PAKTON在预测准确性、检索性能、可解释性、完整性和合理性方面优于通用和预训练模型。

Conclusion: PAKTON为合同审查提供了一种更高效、灵活且保护隐私的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands
specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts.
Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is
pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding
these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use
with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives.
To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source,
end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is
designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative
agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component,
enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable,
and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both
general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval
performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as
evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床诊断和治疗等任务需要强大的决策能力，因此需要严格的评估基准来测试大型语言模型（LLMs）的可靠性。现有临床多选题数据集难度不足，无法充分暴露模型的弱点。

Method: 采用知识图谱引导的数据增强框架，通过多步语义遍历医疗知识图谱生成临床可信但具有误导性的干扰项（distractors）。

Result: 在六个主流医疗QA基准测试中，该方法显著降低了最先进LLM的准确率，证明其能有效增强评估的严谨性。

Conclusion: KGGDG为医疗领域LLM提供了更鲁棒、更具诊断性的评估工具，生成的干扰项能更真实地反映模型临床推理的潜在缺陷。

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making
abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to
assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we
introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the
difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating
distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and
may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices
are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach
involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph
to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but
factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive
distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation
(KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it
consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings
establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic
evaluations of medical LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器训练方法存在三个主要问题：未考虑示例的协同效应、未充分融入查询语言特征、评分未直接优化DST性能，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 提出CombiSearch方法，基于示例组合对DST性能的影响进行评分，优化检索器训练数据。

Result: 在MultiWOZ上，CombiSearch超越现有方法，数据效率提升20倍，在SGD数据集上泛化良好，DST性能上限提升12%。

Conclusion: CombiSearch显著提升DST性能上限，证明现有方法依赖次优训练数据。

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever
that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses
these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing
methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key
limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the
linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and
(3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the
retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST
performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that
scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST
performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with
CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data
efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch
attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over
traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly
increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that
existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

Method: 通过分析错误模式，提出输入分块方法和序列级信息整合技术，无需依赖单语ASR系统。

Result: 改进方法减少了语言与口音的混淆，显著提升口音语音上的性能，同时保持标准LID任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LID模型在口音语音上的局限性，并提出有效方法提升其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on
accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of
these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on
accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the
speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence
suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short
spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic
features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a
simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking.
(iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into
our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces
accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented
speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

TL;DR: 通过分析芝加哥Craigslist租房广告，研究城市空间如何通过语言被社会构建，揭示了传统方法忽视的空间定义争议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨租房广告如何通过语言反映城市空间的社会构建，以及机构边界与社区主张之间的不匹配。

Method: 结合人工和大语言模型标注，对Craigslist非结构化租房广告进行分类，并进行地理空间分析和主题建模。

Result: 发现三种空间模式：因竞争性空间定义导致的冲突、边界属性对相邻社区的合理主张，以及“声誉洗白”现象。远离社区中心的房源强调不同的便利设施。

Conclusion: 自然语言处理技术能揭示传统方法忽略的城市空间定义争议，为理解城市空间的社会构建提供新视角。

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially
constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental
advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize
neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and
neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we
classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood.
Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with
conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions,
border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation
laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable
neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with
spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize
different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that
natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban
spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的毒性语音日益严重，但针对越南语等低资源语言的音频毒性检测研究不足。

Method: 构建ViToSA数据集（11,000个标注样本），提出ASR模型微调+文本毒性片段检测的两阶段管道方法。

Result: 微调后的ASR模型词错误率显著降低，文本毒性检测模型性能超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 该研究为越南语语音内容审核建立了新基准，推动了语音毒性检测领域发展。

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user
experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is
well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for
low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA
(Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in
Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate
human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic
spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces
WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection
(TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel
benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for
future research in speech content moderation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种任务无关的置信度度量方法，用于改进文本生成模型的校准，无需额外微调或启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本生成模型的置信度分数若校准良好，可提升其实用性，例如通过提示用户审查低置信度预测以避免不良或危险输出。然而，现有方法因生成任务中可能存在多个有效答案，导致置信度校准不佳。

Method: 提出了一种仅依赖模型输出概率的任务无关置信度度量方法，无需进一步微调或启发式规则。

Result: 该方法在BART和Flan-T5模型上改进了摘要、翻译和问答数据集的校准效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的置信度度量方法有效提升了生成任务的模型校准，增强了模型输出的可靠性。

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text
generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions
with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially
dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well
calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be
many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a
confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple
sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence
metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated
with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.
Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on
summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要针对单选题评估，但现实问题常需从多个选项中识别所有正确答案，这种能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建跨领域SATA-BENCH基准测试27个模型，提出结合标记去偏和自适应阈值的Choice Funnel解码策略。

Result: 最强模型仅41.8%完全匹配率，Choice Funnel使准确率提升29%且推理成本降低64%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LLMs在多答案推理的根本缺陷，并为实际应用提供了诊断和改进框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer
multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all
correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored.
We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including
reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source
and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model
achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify
all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges:
selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count
bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these
issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token
debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and
accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than
competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings
expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework
for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and
Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in
realistic, multi-answer applications.

Motivation: 传统信息抽取系统需要针对不同领域进行昂贵的专家模式设计、数据标注和模型训练，而大语言模型在零样本信息抽取中虽表现良好，但在定义不同的未知领域性能下降明显。

Method: GUIDEX通过自动定义领域特定模式、推断标注指南并生成合成标注实例，结合Llama 3.1微调，提升了模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Result: 在七个零样本命名实体识别基准测试中，GUIDEX达到了新的最优性能，比之前方法提升了7个F1值（无需人工标注数据），结合人工标注数据后进一步提升近2个F1值。

Conclusion: GUIDEX显著增强了模型对复杂领域特定标注模式的理解能力，为信息抽取的跨领域应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific,
requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data
annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise
in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where
label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that
automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates
synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain
generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art
across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with
GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data,
and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX
demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation
schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at

Method: 基于MUStARD数据集标注7类讽刺，采用零样本/少样本/思维链提示，创新提出情感提示技术及基于 incongruity-shock-context 的生成框架。

Result: Gemini 2.5模型使用情感提示获得0.3664 F1值，人工评估显示其生成成功率比零样本高38.46%。

Conclusion: 情感提示能有效提升讽刺处理效果，为自然语言理解提供新方向。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to
their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large
language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses
challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce
Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating,
brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries
of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We
propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key
components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our
classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting,
outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred
our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than
zero-shot prompting.

Result: STREAM方法在多种大语言模型上测试，攻击成功率降低51.2%，同时保持模型功能。

Conclusion: STREAM方法能有效防御多轮对话攻击，显著提升大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them
in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant
safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense
mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues
(STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their
functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated
dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to
fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to
identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the
target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against
prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM
capability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动化评估大语言模型（LLMs）在生成三层次法律论据任务中的表现的方法，重点考察了忠实性、因素利用和适当弃权能力。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在复杂法律任务如论据生成中展现出潜力，但其可靠性仍存疑。本研究旨在通过自动化方法评估LLMs在生成法律论据时的表现，特别是在避免幻觉、利用案例因素和正确弃权方面的能力。

Method: 研究采用自动化流程，利用外部LLM从生成的论据中提取因素，并与输入案例中的真实因素进行对比。评估了八种不同LLM在三个难度递增的测试中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，当前LLM在避免幻觉方面表现良好（准确率超过90%），但在充分利用案例因素方面仍有不足。在需要弃权的测试中，多数模型未能遵循指令，生成了无根据的论据。

Conclusion: 自动化评估流程为衡量LLM在法律任务中的关键行为提供了可扩展的方法，强调了在可靠部署前需改进因素利用和弃权能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks
like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building
upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human
evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM
performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of
hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define
hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case
materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating
arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method
employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and
compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case
triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct
LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply
argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)
recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared
factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve
high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument
generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of
relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test
3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating
spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline
provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors,
highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust
abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings. Project

Motivation: 现有的论证数据集难以检测到间接攻击和隐含关系，需要一个更直观且支持高级推理的论证表示方法。

Method: 从基础论证组件和关系标注出发，构建带元数据的知识库图，应用假言推理形成论证，最终生成具有丰富属性的AKG。

Result: AKG能识别传统方法遗漏的间接攻击，并通过图形化表示提升论证结构的可理解性，为后续推理任务奠定基础。

Conclusion: AKG框架通过显式标注推理规则和隐含关系，为论证连贯性检查和修订提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument
knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative
components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information
by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes.
Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by
applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and
edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features.
We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it
possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in
existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative
structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also
prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the
coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it
is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our
proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help
reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference
over arguments and the relations between them.

Motivation: 现有的端到端口语对话系统需要大规模训练数据且生成的响应缺乏语义连贯性，因此需要一种更高效且能保持语义一致性的方法。

Method: 通过思维链（CoT）策略，将对话数据训练与多模态语言模型的预训练（如语音识别ASR、文本转语音TTS和文本语言模型任务）紧密结合。

Result: 该方法在ROUGE-1指标上比基线提升了1.5分，仅需300小时的公开人-人对话数据（如Switchboard）即可高效训练。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅提升了口语对话系统的性能，还显著降低了训练数据需求，模型和训练代码将公开。

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue
systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information,
making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E
approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses
lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy
leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on
conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model
(LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis
(TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over
the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly
available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient
enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such
as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language
models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and
training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss
function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first
enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along
task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient
magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more
efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task
generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This
mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the
source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and
cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks,
the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy,
gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under
different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's
robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular,
the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The
results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively
leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures
training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

Abstract: Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating
complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has
mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of
narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which
formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set
of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of
narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their
ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our
framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a
second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with
prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于音素的端到端长度敏感语音翻译模型（LSST）和长度感知束搜索（LABS）方法，用于实时设备端视频配音，显著提升了源音频与目标音频的同步质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频配音中，将翻译后的音频与源音频对齐是一个重要挑战。研究旨在为实时设备端视频配音场景提供高效解决方案。

Method: 开发了基于音素的端到端长度敏感语音翻译模型（LSST），通过预定义标签生成不同长度的翻译；并引入长度感知束搜索（LABS），在单次解码中高效生成不同长度的翻译。

Result: 在保持与基线相当的BLEU分数同时，显著提升了同步质量，西班牙语和韩语的平均意见分数（MOS）分别提高了0.34和0.65。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时视频配音中有效解决了音频同步问题，同时保持了翻译质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In video dubbing, aligning translated audio with the source audio is a
significant challenge. Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for
real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based
end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model, which generates
translations of varying lengths short, normal, and long using predefined tags.
Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient
approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding
pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline
without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality
between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of
0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出Data Swarms算法优化合成评估数据生成，并通过对抗性群体协同进化提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估数据生成方法难以满足多样化评估需求，需优化数据生成器以提升评估质量。

Method: 1. 训练初始数据生成器群体 2. 定义多目标评估指标 3. 使用粒子群优化协同搜索参数空间 4. 扩展为对抗性群体共同进化。

Result: 在5个评估目标上超越8个基线，对抗群体产生更鲁棒的数据和更强泛化能力，可迁移至新LLM。

Conclusion: Data Swarms能有效优化多目标组合，对抗协同进化机制可同步提升数据质量和模型能力。

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic
evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first
train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define
various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation
(e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and
quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm
optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they
collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators
that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms,
where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model
swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms
eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while
Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger
generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully
optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new
off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在联邦学习框架中高效执行参数高效微调（PEFT）的方法，通过头剪枝、加权聚合和客户端选择策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低通信和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管参数高效微调（PEFT）在自然语言处理中广泛应用，但在隐私保护的分布式学习框架（如联邦学习）中采用较少，主要由于资源受限设备和客户端数据分布多样性等挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于多头注意力（MHA）语言模型的高效PEFT方法，包括头剪枝以减少训练复杂度、头特异性加权聚合机制以捕捉关键更新，以及客户端选择策略。

Result: 在MultiNLI等数据集上，使用T5-small模型和LoRA方法，实现了高达90%的稀疏度，通信优势达1.8倍，训练操作减少3.9倍，精度下降控制在2%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习框架中有效实现了参数高效微调，显著降低了资源消耗，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language
Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning
frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This
is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained
devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head
pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client
selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the
clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the
attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures
crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection
strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups,
XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model
with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting
in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of
3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器翻译中性别偏见和逻辑连贯性挑战，特别是在英语等自然性别语言与波斯语等无性别语言之间的翻译。

Method: 构建TWC数据集（含3950个挑战性场景），评估GPT-4等模型的翻译表现，并对mBART-50进行微调。

Result: 所有模型在无性别翻译中均表现不佳，存在男性代词偏好；微调后的mBART-50显著减少偏见并实现泛化，性能超越闭源大模型。

Conclusion: 需针对无性别语言开发专项翻译方法，微调开源模型可有效提升翻译公平性与准确性。

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine
translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural
gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian,
Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset,
comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource
languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse
technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate,
reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in
gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine
pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and
GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more
than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning
mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong
generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source.
This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic
coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages,
contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在多语言环境下存在隐私泄露风险，研究发现通过识别并停用隐私通用神经元和语言特定神经元，可降低23.3%-31.6%的跨语言隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前研究通过隐私神经元等方法缓解了英语环境下的隐私泄露风险，但未考虑跨语言场景。本文旨在探究多语言环境下大语言模型的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 研究首先分析了跨语言隐私泄露的信息流，发现隐私信息主要在模型中间层处理，并在后续层转换为语言特定空间时风险最高。基于此，识别了隐私通用神经元和语言特定神经元。

Result: 通过停用这些神经元，跨语言隐私泄露风险降低了23.3%-31.6%。

Conclusion: 跨语言隐私泄露是一个重要问题，通过针对性停用特定神经元可有效降低风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information
embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of
privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information
(PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated
through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the
(sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they
cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if
the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may
still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this
work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy
leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private
information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared
across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a
language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify
privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons.
Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while
language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By
deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced
by 23.3%-31.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定长度分块方法可能导致语义相关内容的分离，影响大语言模型对长文本的准确理解。

Method: 通过计算相邻句子的语义相似度动态分块，并训练问题感知分类器选择关键块。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中表现优异，支持长达256k tokens的输入。

Conclusion: 动态分块与选择方法显著提升了大模型处理长文本的能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend
extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on
splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation
risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and
compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of
long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we
compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower
similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We
further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are
critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains
robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to
256k tokens. Our datasets and code are available at the following link:

Motivation: 传统自动评估指标在生物医学关系抽取任务中不可靠，而人工评估成本高且耗时。因此，研究探索LLMs作为替代评估方法的潜力。

Method: 研究对8个LLMs作为评估者进行基准测试，评估5个LLMs在3个生物医学关系抽取数据集上的表现，并提出结构化输出格式和领域适应技术。

Result: LLMs作为评估者在生物医学关系抽取任务中表现较差（通常低于50%准确率），但通过结构化输出和领域适应技术，性能平均提升约15%。

Conclusion: 结构化输出和领域适应技术能有效提升LLMs作为评估者在生物医学关系抽取任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However,
evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to
generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of
gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics
unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is
costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications.
This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative
evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as
judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical
relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe
that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the
biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly
because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To
address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated
responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on
average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance
LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets.
We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k
samples in total) for public use here:

TL;DR: KG-TRACES框架通过知识图谱约束的推理路径监督，提升大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的可解释性和可信度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在可解释性不足和可信度低的问题，如幻觉或无来源的推理过程，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出KG-TRACES框架，通过联合监督模型预测符号关系路径、完整三元组推理路径，并生成基于推理路径的可归因推理过程。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ任务中，Hits@1和F1分数显著提升，分别达到1.6%/4.7%和4.8%/2.1%的改进，并展示出在医学等专业领域的迁移能力。

Conclusion: KG-TRACES通过显式监督推理路径，实现了更稳定、目标明确的推理过程，显著提升模型性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural
language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems
remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue,
often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,
limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we
propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain
Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the
reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and
processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic
relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate
attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At
inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable
scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting
plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design
enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.
Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%
and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%
in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such
as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we
further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to
more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with
correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Motivation: 提升语言技术的文化适应能力很重要，但现有工作很少与所研究的社区互动，而是依赖合成设置和不完美的文化代理。

Method: 采用以人为中心的方法，通过访谈跨学科研究者，构建了研究文化差异的框架，并开发了一套计算指标来量化这些差异。

Result: 研究发现人类论文中存在潜在的文化规范，而LLMs在文化适应性上表现不足，倾向于同质化写作风格。

Conclusion: 研究表明，以人为中心的方法能有效测量人类写作和LLM生成文本中的文化规范，并揭示了LLMs在文化适应性上的局限性。

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However
most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead
rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we
take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural
norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture,
research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research
cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who
are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural,
stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures.
We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use
them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers
at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and
their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the
efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in
human-written and LLM-generated texts.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统评估很少测试其在真实噪声、内部与外部检索上下文冲突或快速变化事实下的表现，因此需要一种统一的评估框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出RARE框架，包括知识图谱驱动的合成管道（RARE-Get）自动生成多级问题集，构建时间敏感数据集（RARE-Set），并定义检索条件鲁棒性指标（RARE-Met）量化系统韧性。

Result: 实验显示RAG系统对扰动表现出意料之外的脆弱性，文档鲁棒性始终是最薄弱环节，且多跳查询的鲁棒性普遍低于单跳查询。

Conclusion: RARE框架揭示了RAG系统在动态环境中的局限性，尤其是文档扰动和多跳查询场景，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in
answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope
with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved
contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness
Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly
stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive
corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven
synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop
relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets
without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset
(RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and
policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the
underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize
retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's
ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world
retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems
exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness
consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or
architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop
queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现不佳，主要原因是过度标注所有视觉对象而忽略了关键元素。论文受双过程理论启发，提出应根据问题复杂度动态调整视觉提示策略。

Method: FOCUS方法结合直觉判断和分析推理：简单问题采用零样本推理，复杂问题采用'先概念化后观察'策略突出关键视觉元素。

Result: 在ScienceQA等四个基准测试中，FOCUS显著提升了开源和黑盒模型的性能，消融实验验证了认知策略与精细视觉信息结合的重要性。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过动态认知策略有效提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉语言推理能力，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have
advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical
limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects
for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade
task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual
elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important,
and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory,
which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human
reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts
to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with
deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning
capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient
zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing
before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive
experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate
that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and
black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation
studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive
strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will
be released.

TL;DR: GuessBench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟人类创造力方面表现的新基准，基于Minecraft的'Guess the Build'游戏数据，结果显示现有模型在创造性理解上仍有显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估VLMs在模拟人类创造力方面的能力，特别是在处理噪声和多样性创造力表达时的表现。通过'Minecraft'游戏中的实际数据，提供了一个真实世界的测试平台。

Method: 研究从'Guess the Build'游戏中收集了1500张图像，设计了2000个问题，涵盖静态和动态图像设置、不同完整度的自然语言提示等。测试了六种开源/API VLMs和五种推理增强方法。

Result: 实验表明，GuessBench对VLMs提出了独特挑战：即使是先进的GPT-4o也有34%的错误率，开源模型与API模型之间存在显著性能差距（13.87% vs. 53.93%）。微调推理轨迹可将视觉感知任务平均提升15.36%。

Conclusion: VLMs在创造性理解上的表现与训练数据中概念的频率相关，对于文化背景较少或低资源语言的概念，准确率显著下降。GuessBench为评估和改进VLMs的创造力建模能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language
Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human
creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online
multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build
given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural
language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the
wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual
gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings,
natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments
with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate
that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling:
even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we
observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and
API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the
reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by
15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity
sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data,
while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural
contexts and low-resource languages.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在自然语言生成方面取得了显著进展，但主要集中在高资源语言。本研究旨在探讨如何将这些模型适配到低资源、形态丰富的语言（如梵语），特别是生成符合古典韵律的结构化诗歌。

Method: 研究引入了一个数据集，用于将英语散文翻译成结构化的梵语诗歌，并严格遵循古典韵律模式（如Anushtub韵律）。评估了多种生成模型，包括开源和专有模型，并探索了约束解码策略和基于指令的微调方法。

Result: 约束解码方法在生成句法有效的诗歌形式上达到了99%以上的准确率，显著优于通用模型。指令微调变体在语义和诗歌风格对齐方面表现更好，但韵律精度略有下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过约束解码和指令微调，大型语言模型可以有效地生成符合古典韵律的低资源语言诗歌，为低资源语言的创造性任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition.
However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic
generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit?
In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose
into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical
patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative
models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically,
we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning
tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over
99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially
outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile,
instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and
poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal
trade-offs in metrical precision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽蕴含丰富知识，但难以保持更新，易产生错误和幻觉。现有知识编辑方法主要针对单一模型，难以高效更新多模型或适应新模型。

Method: 提出OnceEdit，采用插件模型作为编辑模块，结合动态权重机制（通过权重标记区分编辑相关实例）和集成增强机制（减少对中心模型的过度依赖）。

Result: 实验表明，OnceEdit在多种LLMs上表现优于现有方法，编辑效率更高，且在多模型编辑场景中具有适应性和稳定性。

Conclusion: OnceEdit为多模型知识编辑提供了高效稳定的解决方案，未来可进一步扩展应用场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay
up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing
offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications
by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily
focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple
models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a
novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing
module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on
the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its
effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight
token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances,
ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models.
Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the
excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble
technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments
on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing
methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms
its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will
be available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）中存在‘真实性方向’特征，但并非所有模型都表现一致，且该特征可推广至多种任务，有助于提升用户对模型输出的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在广泛数据集上训练并包含大量世界知识，但其输出常包含自信陈述的错误。前人研究提出‘真实性方向’作为线性特征，本文旨在探讨该方向的普遍性、探测方法及其在不同上下文中的泛化能力。

Method: 研究通过分析不同LLMs中‘真实性方向’的一致性，测试其在逻辑否定等复杂情境下的表现，并验证基于原子陈述训练的真实性探针在多种任务中的泛化效果。

Result: 发现并非所有LLMs都表现出一致的‘真实性方向’，能力更强的模型在此特征上表现更优。真实性探针可有效推广至逻辑转换、问答任务及外部知识源，并在选择性问答中提升用户信任。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLMs内部‘真实性方向’的理解，展示了其在改进模型输出可信度方面的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that
encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include
confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode
truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which
can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the
truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth
directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to
identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across
diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent
truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable
models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we
demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements
can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering
tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore
the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective
question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM
outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and
provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs. Our code

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HERGC的多模态知识图谱补全框架，通过结合异构专家表示和生成式LLM预测器，有效提升了补全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态知识图谱补全方法通常仅基于封闭世界假设利用图谱内信息，且采用判别式训练目标，限制了推理能力。生成式方法在单模态图谱补全中表现优异，但在多模态场景下的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: HERGC框架包含异构专家表示检索器（融合多模态信息并检索候选集）和生成式LLM预测器（基于指令微调从候选集中识别正确答案）。

Result: 在三个标准多模态知识图谱基准测试中，HERGC实现了最先进的性能，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将生成式方法扩展到多模态知识图谱补全领域，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs)
by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal
knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals
to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of
MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained
in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative
training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion.
Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language
models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph
completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and
Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous
Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information
and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses
a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately
identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on
three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and
robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的基准COMPKE，用于评估知识编辑方法在复杂推理场景下的表现，发现不同方法在不同模型上效果差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的知识编辑基准主要使用多跳问答来评估新注入或更新的知识，但这些基准未能有效评估模型在现实场景中应用这些知识的能力，尤其是涉及复杂推理的问题。

Method: 作者引入了COMPKE基准，包含11,924个反映现实场景的复杂问题，并对四种知识编辑方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，不同知识编辑方法在不同模型上的效果差异显著，例如MeLLo在GPT-4O-MINI上的准确率为39.47，而在QWEN2.5-3B上仅为3.83。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了知识编辑方法在不同模型上的效果差异，并探讨了这些差异的方法和模型特定原因，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language
models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use
multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated
knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate
how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios,
particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many
relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we
introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge
Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life
situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing
methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across
different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on
GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further
investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological
and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CoRE框架，通过对比检索增强生成和蒙特卡洛树搜索扩展经验记忆，显著提升大语言模型在结构化数据任务（如Text-to-SQL和TableQA）上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在纯文本任务上表现优异，但在处理表格和数据库等结构化数据时表现不佳，主要由于预训练中缺乏相关数据以及文本到结构的转换机制不够灵活。

Method: 引入CoRE框架，利用对比性上下文学习（ICL）模拟人类知识迁移，并通过蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成经验记忆，扩展训练数据的多样性和领域覆盖。

Result: 在Text-to-SQL和TableQA任务上，CoRE平均提升3.44%和4.24%的性能，某些挑战性任务提升高达17.2%。经验记忆扩展训练数据8-9倍。

Conclusion: CoRE作为一种无需训练且持续的方法，有效缩小了大语言模型与结构化数据专家之间的认知差距，推动了其在结构化知识领域的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks
but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential
challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid
text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply
learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit
relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of
explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce
Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework
that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization
through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge
transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly
improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to
17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated
Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain
coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward
structured knowledge expertise.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEG2TEXT-CN是一个针对中文的开源词汇EEG到文本生成框架，结合生物启发的EEG编码器和预训练语言模型，通过对比学习和掩码预训练实现脑信号与自然语言的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在探索非语音、跨模态的脑电信号解码为中文文本的可行性，为多语言脑到文本研究开辟新方向，并为未来中文认知语言接口奠定基础。

Method: 基于NICE-EEG生物编码器和MiniLM语言模型，采用掩码预训练和对比学习对齐多通道脑电信号与语言表征。使用包含约10个汉字/句的ChineseEEG数据集子集，在零样本设置下分割EEG为单字嵌入并预测完整句子。

Result: 在1500+训练验证句和300测试句上取得6.38%的BLEU-1分数，显示词汇对齐潜力，但句法流畅性仍待提升。

Conclusion: EEG2TEXT-CN证明了从脑电信号解码中文文本的可行性，为跨模态语言解码研究提供了新范式，尤其适用于中文认知接口开发。

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one
of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for
Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact
pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain
signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and
contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each
sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel
EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and
predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with
teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences.
Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test
samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%.
While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work
opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the
foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

TL;DR: 该论文通过信息瓶颈原理解释了双向语言模型优于单向模型的原因，并提出FlowNIB方法来量化信息保留与压缩的动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双向语言模型在自然语言理解任务中表现优于单向模型，但其理论优势尚不明确。本研究旨在从信息瓶颈（IB）原理的角度探究这种差异。

Method: 提出FlowNIB方法，动态估计训练过程中的互信息，克服传统IB方法的计算难题和固定权衡问题，并建立衡量表示复杂度的通用框架。

Result: 理论证明双向模型保留更多互信息且具有更高有效维度；实验验证双向表示在温和条件下严格更具信息量，并揭示训练中信息编码的规律。

Conclusion: 研究为双向架构的有效性提供了理论解释，并提供了分析深度语言模型信息流的实用工具FlowNIB。

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform
better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet
the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we
investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB)
principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information
and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and
scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that
addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational
intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that
bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher
effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we
present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and
prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under
mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments
across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is
encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a
principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and
introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了L3Cube-MahaEmotions数据集，用于低资源马拉地语的情感识别，通过LLM合成标注训练数据，手动标注验证和测试集，发现通用LLM在复杂情感识别任务上优于微调BERT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于低资源语言如马拉地语缺乏标注数据，情感识别面临挑战。论文旨在构建高质量标注数据集，并探索LLM在此类任务中的潜力。

Method: 采用Chain-of-Translation提示技术，将马拉地语句子翻译为英语并通过单一提示进行情感标注。使用GPT-4和Llama3-405B进行标注评估，选择GPT-4标注训练数据。

Result: GPT-4预测优于微调BERT模型，但基于合成标签训练的BERT模型未能超越GPT-4。通用LLM在复杂低资源情感识别任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 高质量人工标注数据对情感识别至关重要，通用LLM在此类任务中具有优势，数据集和模型已公开。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains
challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a
high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion
labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language
models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve
as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we
apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi
sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt.
GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data
annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using
standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union,
Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models,
BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This
highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the
inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work
is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than
fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset
and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出当前视觉语言模型(VLMs)在因果推理能力上的不足，并提出了两个新基准VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal来专门评估这一能力。研究发现VLMs在因果推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据中缺乏明确的因果关系表达。通过针对性微调可以提升模型的因果推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现优异，但其对视觉输入中因果关系的理解和推理能力尚不明确。现有基准测试常混合多种推理问题，模型可通过物体识别等捷径回答问题，难以真实评估其因果推理能力。

Method: 研究者引入了VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal两个新基准，专门用于隔离和严格评估VLMs的因果推理能力。此外还探索了使用困难负例进行针对性微调的策略。

Result: 研究发现VLMs在物体和活动识别方面表现优异，但在因果推理任务上表现较差，仅略高于随机猜测。分析表明这是由于训练数据中严重缺乏明确的因果关系表达。针对性微调可提升因果推理能力且不影响泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前VLMs在因果理解方面的关键缺陷，为未来提升模型因果推理能力的研究奠定了基础。通过改进训练数据和微调策略可以增强这一能力。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on
downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal
relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is
fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing
benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can
frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts
to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their
causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and
VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously
evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs
excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal
reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further
analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal
expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are
rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with
hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's
causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance.
Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for
future work on causal understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出CC-Tuning方法，通过在潜在层面建立跨语言连接机制，提升多语言大模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）由于以英语为中心的训练语料，多语言能力不均衡。现有方法多在数据层面微调，忽略了潜在层面更深层次的跨语言交互。

Method: CC-Tuning在训练时融合英语和非英语输入的激活值，通过可训练的决策机制识别有益激活；推理时使用转换矩阵模拟跨语言连接。

Result: 在22种语言的6个基准测试中，CC-Tuning优于普通监督微调（SFT），并成为数据增强方法的潜在层面替代方案。

Conclusion: CC-Tuning展示了潜在层面跨语言交互在提升LLMs多语言性能方面的潜力和实用性。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual
capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this,
existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data
augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual
alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level
cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel
multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual
connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the
feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the
model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated
with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations.
Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the
cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation
transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show
that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level
alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also
highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level
cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出选择性遗忘（SU）方法，仅针对关键token进行遗忘，避免传统方法对通用知识的破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM遗忘方法会无差别更新所有目标文档中的token，包括携带通用知识的常见token，这可能导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出选择性遗忘（SU），识别并仅遗忘与目标信息相关的关键token子集。

Result: 实验表明，SU在有效遗忘目标数据的同时，显著保留了模型在保留集上的性能。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘是一种更精细、高效的LLM遗忘方法，平衡了遗忘效果与模型效用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant
attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private,
sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning
approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a
target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general
nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every
token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies
a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the
unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two
benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only
achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also
significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

Motivation: 由于全面测试多模态大语言模型(MLLM)在大规模数据上的表现既耗时又耗费资源，因此需要一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 首先构建了一个带有难度标签的面试数据集，然后提出MITV策略，通过少量问题快速评估模型性能并持续测试其极限。

Result: 实验表明，MITV策略在基准数据集上表现良好，能够通过少量问答快速获得模型评估结果。

Conclusion: MITV策略是一种高效的多模态大语言模型评估方法，能够显著减少评估所需的时间和资源。

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a
wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung
up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on
large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this
issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly
obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we
constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM
assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of
some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview
strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by
quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the
model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV
strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and
it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small
number of questions and answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出A4Bench基准，评估多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的承启感知能力，发现现有模型表现远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉语言任务表现出色，但其承启感知能力（对环境中潜在行为可能性的理解）尚未充分探索，这对实现直观安全的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 构建包含2,000个QA对的A4Bench基准，分为构成性承启（静态属性）和转化性承启（动态情境）两个维度，评估17个MLLMs模型。

Result: 专有模型优于开源模型，但所有模型表现有限（最佳Gemini-2.0-Pro准确率18.05%），远低于人类水平（81.25%-85.34%），尤其在转化性承启任务上差距显著。

Conclusion: MLLMs的环境理解存在重大缺陷，需提升情境感知能力。A4Bench为开发更鲁棒的AI系统奠定基础，数据集已开源。

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action
possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to
perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions,
remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two
dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent
object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine
sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and
contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or
individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs.
Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human
performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source
counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in
transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models,
such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag
behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings
highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a
foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware
interactions. The dataset is available in

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior,
raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI
equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating
social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational
evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and
process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to
address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI
benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually
crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that
contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive
view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall
behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more
positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs'
formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have
developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

*Yongdong chi,Hanqing Wang,Zonghan Yang,Jian Yang,Xiao Yan,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pi-SQL通过引入Python作为中间层，显著提升了自然语言到SQL的转换准确率和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在自然语言查询与低资源SQL程序之间存在较大语义鸿沟，导致准确性受限。

Method: Pi-SQL首先生成提供细粒度逐步指导的Python程序，然后基于Python程序的指导生成SQL程序。

Result: Pi-SQL的执行准确率比最佳基线提高了3.20，效率评分高出4.55。

Conclusion: Pi-SQL通过Python作为中间层，有效缩小了自然语言与SQL之间的语义差距，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable
SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing
prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to
facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic
gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we
propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot
to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular,
Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step
guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program
following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the
reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates
generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a
reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing
baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which
improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

*Aishik Nagar,Ishaan Singh Rawal,Mansi Dhanania,Cheston Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了不同语言模型中复合词的组合性表现，发现大多数嵌入模型具有高度组合性，而BERT表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合性是人类智能的关键特征，对推理和泛化至关重要。然而，基于Transformer的模型在复合词表示方面的组合性尚不明确。

Method: 研究评估了Mistral、OpenAI Large、Google嵌入模型和BERT的组合性，采用了六种不同的组合性模型（加法、乘法、膨胀、回归等）进行分析，并使用合成数据集验证结果。

Result: 研究发现，尽管是线性模型，岭回归最能解释组合性。经典的向量加法模型表现几乎与其他模型相当。大多数嵌入模型表现出高度组合性，而BERT的组合性较差。

Conclusion: 研究全面调查了语言模型中的组合性，揭示了不同模型在复合词表示上的差异，为理解模型的语言处理能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for
reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de
facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they
represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional.
In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google
embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate
compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of
compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We
find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality.
Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as
well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly
compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and
visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent
adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of
compositionality.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种支持多任务和灵活心电图输入的多模态大语言模型anyECG-chat，并构建了包含多种任务和心电图类型的anyECG数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的心电图分析多模态大语言模型主要关注报告生成任务，且输入受限，未能充分发挥其潜力。此外，现有的心电图问答数据集较为单一。

Method: 首先构建了anyECG数据集，包含多种任务和心电图类型；然后提出了anyECG-chat模型，支持动态长度和多个心电图输入，并使用三阶段课程训练方法进行训练。

Result: 评估表明，anyECG-chat能够支持多种实际应用场景，包括报告生成、家庭环境中长时程少导联心电图的异常波形定位以及多个心电图的综合比较分析。

Conclusion: anyECG-chat模型在多种心电图分析任务中表现出色，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest
in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing
ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to
single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the
potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that
supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However,
existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first
constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks,
including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended
question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced
long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG
comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we
propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and
multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum
training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was
conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various
practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation
tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead
ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple
ECGs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）生成讽刺语音数据集的标注流程，并通过人类验证提升质量，最终构建了一个大规模讽刺语音数据集PodSarc，检测模型F1分数达73.63%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测系统多依赖多模态数据，在仅有语音的场景中适用性受限，且数据稀缺问题阻碍了语音讽刺检测的发展。

Method: 基于公开讽刺播客，使用GPT-4o和LLaMA 3进行初始标注，经人工校验解决分歧，并通过协作门控架构验证标注质量与检测性能。

Result: 构建了PodSarc数据集，检测模型F1分数为73.63%，证明了其作为讽刺检测研究基准的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM辅助标注流程能有效解决数据稀缺问题，PodSarc数据集为单模态语音讽刺检测提供了可靠基准。

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting
it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing
detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability
in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an
annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a
sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ
GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human
verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing
annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm
dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce
PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline.
The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's
potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数学问题生成方法仅关注文本质量，忽视教育目标，且无法满足复杂多维的教育需求。

Method: 基于EduMath数据集，开发EQGEVAL评估框架，采用“计划-评估-优化”流程，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和LLM迭代优化问题生成。

Result: 实验表明EQPR在满足多维教育目标的问题生成上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: EQPR通过自优化机制有效生成符合教育场景的数学问题，实现了基础教学目标。

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with
educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology.
Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they
often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only
single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex,
multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we
constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with
multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed
EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to
assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing
inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational
Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational
mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize"
approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo
Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we
continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This
self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the
educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational
objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have
demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating
questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业数据管理中，LLM需处理敏感信息并遵守访问限制，但传统基于用户权限的过滤方法存在性能与隐私挑战。

Method: 提出敏感性感知（SA）框架，并构建ACCESS DENIED INC基准测试环境来评估模型行为。

Result: 实验表明不同模型对未授权数据请求的处理存在显著差异，同时能有效响应合法查询。

Conclusion: 该研究为敏感性感知语言模型建立了基准，为企业环境中隐私优先的AI系统提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate
data management due to their ability to process text from various document
formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries.
However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating
with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on
user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To
address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which
enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we
developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA.
Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior,
particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively
addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for
benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance
privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了XGUARD基准和评估框架，用于更细致地评估大语言模型生成极端内容的严重性，填补了现有安全评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型安全评估通常采用简单的二元标签（安全/不安全），无法全面反映模型输出内容的真实风险等级。

Method: 构建包含3,840个真实世界红队提示的XGUARD基准，采用五级危险分类（0-4）和可解释的攻击严重性曲线（ASC）进行分析。

Result: 评估了6个主流大语言模型和2种轻量级防御策略，揭示了当前安全漏洞及鲁棒性与表达自由之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 分级安全指标对构建可信赖的大语言模型具有重要价值，XGUARD框架为安全评估提供了更精细的分析工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological
rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety
evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe),
overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this,
we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the
severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red
teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news,
covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework
categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more
nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce
the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and
compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate
six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights
into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive
freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building
trustworthy LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GPT-4o启发，研究者希望语音语言模型能进行更自然的语音交互，但现有方法未能充分利用双通道语音数据。

Method: 论文引入Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP)方法，系统探索双通道语音数据在现代大语言模型中的应用。

Result: 实验表明NTPP在对话轮换预测、响应连贯性和自然度上表现优异，且推理延迟显著低于现有方法。

Conclusion: NTPP为实时语音交互提供了一种高效解决方案，推动了语音语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest
in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken
interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of
several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current
approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently
captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we
systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of
modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling
paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent
dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the
first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical
results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the
conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response
coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP
achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical
efficiency for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言全球事件分析中事件参数和实体跨语言归一化的挑战。

Method: 基于ACLED部分重标注数据，采用抽象事件抽取（AEE）和抽象实体链接（AEL），评估LLMs并开发ZEST零样本检索系统。

Result: 最佳零样本系统端到端F1得分58.3%，ZEST实体链接F1得分45.7%，但仍落后监督系统20.1%和37.0%。

Conclusion: 零样本方法有潜力但需进一步研究以缩小与监督系统的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising
39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of
region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset
of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented
global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event
analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask,
abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event
extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic
document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We
evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing
zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models.
Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for
AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs
outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity
linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a
state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these
zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in
the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further
research.

Motivation: 探讨自监督学习模型在不同语言预训练下对特定语言特征的编码能力，尤其是荷兰语的语音和词汇信息。

Method: 通过对比在荷兰语、英语及多语言数据上预训练的Wav2Vec2模型，使用聚类、分类探针及零样本指标分析语言特征的编码效果。

Result: 荷兰语预训练模型在荷兰语特征编码上优于英语或多语言预训练模型，且与下游语音识别性能正相关。

Conclusion: 特定语言预训练能显著提升模型对该语言特征的编码能力，并改善下游任务表现。

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised
models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be
successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings.
However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages
improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of
Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of
self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the
representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on
similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This
language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or
classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics.
Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding
aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful
information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver
satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary
writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such
as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our
approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital
archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different
proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the
best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less
effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age
of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of
errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their
limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations
of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching
and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant
designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities
data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach
and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic
query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and
hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments
were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The
testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries
from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century.
The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as
well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring
prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases
with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency
in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains
a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how
fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical
evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the
geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of
training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a
contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during
training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights
into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically,
the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training
capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,
overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as
illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a
practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany
and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to
provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of
fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when
configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work
contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and
generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms
and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对大型语言模型（LLM）的探究已经提供了关于其内部机制的有价值见解，但神经元如何功能性地共同激活以产生新兴能力仍然未知，这阻碍了对LLM的更深入理解和更安全开发。

Method: 论文引入了'graph probing'方法，通过分析不同LLM家族和规模的内部神经图，揭示神经元的功能连接拓扑，并将其与语言生成性能相关联。

Result: 研究发现，仅通过神经拓扑就能普遍预测下一个标记的预测性能，且这种预测性即使在仅保留1%的神经元连接或仅进行8次预训练步骤后也依然稳健。进一步的图匹配分析表明，尽管在架构、参数和训练数据上存在显著差异，不同的LLM发展出了复杂且一致的神经拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型发展出的神经拓扑结构可能是其语言生成能力的基础，这一发现有助于更深入理解和更安全地开发LLM。

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their
internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable
semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to
give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper
understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph
probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM
neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing
internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a
universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural
topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron
connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the
sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching
analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures,
parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent
neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language
generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released
at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

Motivation: 情感通过身体体验和反应表现，但在文本中识别这种具体化的情感尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用大型语言模型进行自动最佳-最差缩放，扩展了现有的二元具体化情感数据集。

Result: 简化提示指令和链式推理显著提高了情绪识别的准确性，使较小模型也能与较大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 该方法在情绪识别任务中表现优异，为具体化情感分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Emotions manifest through physical experiences and bodily reactions, yet
identifying such embodied emotions in text remains understudied. We present an
embodied emotion classification dataset, CHEER-Ekman, extending the existing
binary embodied emotion dataset with Ekman's six basic emotion categories.
Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve
performance superior to supervised approaches on our new dataset. Our
investigation reveals that simplified prompting instructions and
chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy,
enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones.

### [132] [SealQA: Raising the Bar for Reasoning in Search-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01062)
*Thinh Pham,Nguyen Nguyen,Pratibha Zunjare,Weiyuan Chen,Yu-Min Tseng,Tu Vu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SealQA是一个新的基准测试，用于评估搜索增强语言模型在事实性问题上的表现，特别是在搜索结果存在冲突、噪声或无帮助的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语言模型在处理事实性问题时，尤其是在搜索结果不理想的情况下，表现不佳。SealQA旨在提供一个评估这些模型能力的基准。

Method: SealQA分为三个版本：Seal-0（主要）、Seal-Hard和LongSeal，分别测试模型的准确性、推理能力和长文本多文档推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，即使是前沿的LLM在SealQA上的表现也很差，尤其是在噪声搜索结果和长文本推理方面。增加计算资源并不能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SealQA揭示了当前模型在处理复杂事实性问题时的局限性，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating
SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search
yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors:
(1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and
reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions
where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3)
LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning
in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations
in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors.
On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini
achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning
efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and
o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing
test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and
o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally,
while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they
still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with
numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at
huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多编程语言（PLs）与英语的概念空间中的关系，发现概念空间更接近英语，并揭示了语言特定神经元的分布规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多关注单语言环境下的编程语言（PLs）机制，而本文旨在探索多PLs与英语在LLMs概念空间中的关系，以揭示模型内部如何表示PLs。

Method: 使用两个基于Llama的模型在21对PLs上进行少样本翻译任务，解码中间层的嵌入，并分析11种PLs和英语的神经元激活情况。

Result: 发现概念空间更接近英语（包括PL关键词），语言特定神经元主要集中在底层，而PL独有的神经元则出现在顶层。高度对齐的PLs无法识别语言特定神经元，且其关键词集更大。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs内部表示PLs的结构模式，为理解模型概念空间提供了新见解。代码已开源。

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a
monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot
translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the
embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept
space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high
probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers.
We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while
language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers,
those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are
highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons
is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other
PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output
PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs
internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept
space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出zip2zip框架，通过动态调整LLM的词汇表来提升推理效率，可将序列长度减少20-60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态分词器无法适应领域或语言特性，导致序列过长和计算成本高。

Method: 基于LZW压缩的分词器实时生成可复用'超词符'，配合运行时嵌入层和因果语言建模变体。

Result: 仅需10 GPU小时微调即可压缩序列，推理延迟显著改善。

Conclusion: zip2zip实现了动态词汇表调整，有效提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of
large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers
optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies
often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer
token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference
time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip
consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch
(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable
"hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for
newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant
that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We
show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via
parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to
use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by
20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在指代消解任务中处理索引词（如I、you、here、tomorrow）的表现，发现模型对部分索引词表现优异，但对其他索引词存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究主要评估了大型语言模型在名词和第三人称代词指代消解任务中的表现，但忽略了索引词（如I、you、here、tomorrow）的独特挑战。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究构建了包含1600道多选题的英语索引词数据集，并评估了GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Gemini 1.5 Pro和DeepSeek V3等模型的表现。

Result: 结果显示，大型语言模型在处理部分索引词（如I）时表现优异，但在处理其他索引词（如you、here、tomorrow）时表现较差。句法线索（如引号）对某些索引词有帮助，但对其他索引词则降低了模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型在处理索引词时存在不均衡表现，句法线索的影响因索引词类型而异，这为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in
tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly
assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person
pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with
indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due
to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs
interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with
1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that
LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while
struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g.
quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they
reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RUL的新型混合训练范式，旨在提升大语言模型（LLMs）在检测不可回答问题并生成适当拒绝回答的能力，从而提高对话AI的可信度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在对话AI系统中广泛应用，但其生成的事实不准确或虚构回答的问题严重影响了用户对其的信任和广泛采用。

Method: RUL方法结合了判别性不可回答预测头与LLM的生成核心，采用多阶段学习策略，包括在有层次标注的新数据集ECA上进行监督微调，以及通过人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）优化拒绝回答的细节和有用性。

Result: 实验表明，RUL在句子、段落和排名级别上的不可回答检测准确率显著提高，同时大幅增加了对不可回答查询的适当拒绝回答生成，且在可回答问题上也表现良好。

Conclusion: RUL显著提升了对话AI的感知帮助性和可信度，为更可靠和以用户为中心的对话AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI
systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for
generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical
impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces
Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm
designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect
unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting,
RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's
generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes
supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset,
Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability
labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a
subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine
the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly
higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and
ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate
refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable
questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness,
highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness,
ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本以外的模态（如语音）中是否能形成类似的概念结构，以及多模态联合训练是否能带来更丰富的语义理解。

Method: 采用无监督的潜在概念分析方法（Latent Concept Analysis），分析语音和文本模型单独及联合训练时的潜在表征。

Result: 研究发现，语音和文本模型均能形成抽象语义概念，且多模态联合训练可能增强语义结构的丰富性。

Conclusion: 结论表明，不同模态的模型均能发展出语义概念，多模态联合训练有助于更结构化、更丰富的语义理解。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems
trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning
capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties
that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing
question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such
as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities:
Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore
this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models
both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an
unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in
neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities.
For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the
community.

Motivation: 现有日志解析器难以捕捉细粒度模板细节，导致下游任务准确率和实用性下降。

Method: 采用字符级神经网络架构，聚合字符嵌入，通过二进制编码序列实现高细粒度模板提取。

Result: 在Loghub-2k和工业数据集上测试，准确率匹配LLM解析器，效率优于语义解析器。

Conclusion: 字符级日志解析器在低资源条件下实现了高精度和高效性，适用于需要精确模式识别的下游任务。

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates
through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights
in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture
fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced
utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We
propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that
aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of
binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our
low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually
annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while
outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对芬兰瑞典语（FS）的发音错误检测模型，使用少量L2数据和多语言wav2vec 2.0模型，通过熵正则化和温度缩放优化，平衡了召回率和精确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前发音错误检测模型主要针对英语等主流语言，而低资源语言变种如芬兰瑞典语缺乏相关工具。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用89小时L1母语者自发语音训练多语言wav2vec 2.0模型，采用熵正则化、温度缩放和top-k归一化优化，适用于低资源语言。

Result: 模型在33分钟L2朗读语音测试中，召回率43.2%，精确率29.8%，相比基线模型（召回率77.5%，精确率17.6%）更平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、语言无关，适用于低资源语言，且仅需少量L2数据，为发音错误检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language
learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and
other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland
Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS,
trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and
tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization,
followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to
better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity,
requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it
suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to
balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline
model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型规模与其对人类阅读时间预测能力下降的关系，验证数据泄露是否为主要影响因素。

Method: 通过两项研究：1) 分析五个自然阅读时间语料库在预训练数据中的泄露程度；2) 使用与阅读时间语料库重叠极少的‘无泄露’数据训练模型，复现模型规模与预测能力的负相关关系。

Result: 1) 预训练数据中阅读时间语料库的泄露程度较低；2) 即使使用‘无泄露’数据，模型规模与预测能力的负相关关系依然存在。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型规模增大导致对人类阅读时间预测能力下降的现象并非由数据泄露引起，先前研究结果具有可靠性。

Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language
models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading
times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage
that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper
presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals
relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two
pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram
overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language
model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on
'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora.
Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models
trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法要么过于粗糙（整句归因），要么与用户需求不匹配（子句归因），需要一种细粒度且用户导向的归因方式。

Method: 提出LAQuer任务框架，探索基于LLM提示和内部表征的两种方法，并在多文档摘要和长问答任务中验证。

Result: LAQuer方法显著减少了归因文本长度，提升了归因效率。

Conclusion: LAQuer为基于内容的文本生成提供了更实用的细粒度归因方案，并建立了评估基准推动未来研究。

Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from
their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing
attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can
be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast,
existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align
with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized
Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of
generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and
user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task,
including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal
representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing
attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across
two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and
Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods
significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions
include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2)
suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3)
proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized
attribution in content-grounded generation.

Result: 在约鲁巴谚语解释任务中，CG-CoT相比传统方法在文化对齐准确性和深度上显著提升，且发现BLEU等指标与人类文化相关性评判存在差异。

Conclusion: CG-CoT有效提升LLMs文化推理能力，同时呼吁重新思考低资源NLP的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning
tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global
applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We
introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting
strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit
reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation
demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned
accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both
automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark
disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged
cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for
low-resource NLP.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究多关注合作性语境下的语用学，缺乏对非合作性话语（如法庭对抗）的系统性分析，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入CoBRA框架（含BaT、PaT、NRBaT三项指标）和CHARM法庭交叉问询标注数据集，量化话语策略效果并评估LLM表现。

Result: LLM对策略语言的理解普遍有限：模型规模提升性能，但推理能力反而导致过度复杂化和内部混淆。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在非合作性语用理解上存在明显缺陷，需开发更针对性的评估与改进方法。

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes,
adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on
cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative
discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response
Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT),
Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to
quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present
CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a
range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic
understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in
performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts,
introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

Motivation: 传统稀疏字典学习无法表示概念间的语义关系，限制了模型的解释性和效率。

Method: 在稀疏自编码器中引入语义层次建模的改进架构。

Result: 该架构成功学习到语义层次，并提升重构效果、可解释性及计算效率。

Conclusion: 显式建模语义层次是提升稀疏表示性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts
to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on
an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither
exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned
concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that
explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this
architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows
both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both
reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to
significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including
uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences.
We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an
adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and
phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order
changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show
that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes
trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy,
sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting
paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法存在灵活性与速度之间的权衡：外部草稿灵活性高但速度慢，自我推测方法速度快但需要重新训练。为了解决这一问题，论文引入了基于Mamba的草稿方法。

Method: 利用Mamba（一种先进的状态空间模型）的线性结构，避免了传统基于Transformer方法的二次复杂度，同时结合了一种新颖的测试时树搜索算法，生成高质量的草稿候选。

Result: 实验表明，基于Mamba的草稿方法不仅优于现有的外部草稿方法，而且在内存使用更少的情况下与最先进的自我推测方法相当，同时保持了跨模型的适应性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的推测解码方法在速度、内存使用和灵活性方面表现出色，为大型语言模型的高效生成提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating
large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining
alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches
face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from
slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the
target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel
drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a
solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the
linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent
in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower
memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target
models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search
algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing
external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art
self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their
cross-model adaptability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFORM是一种新型推理框架，通过两阶段方法高效处理长上下文，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在实际应用中的普及，处理超出预训练上下文限制的极长文本成为关键挑战。现有方法在信息保留或内存资源消耗方面存在不足。

Method: REFORM采用两阶段方法：1) 增量处理输入块，维护压缩的KV缓存，构建跨层上下文嵌入，并使用早期退出策略提高效率；2) 通过相似性匹配识别并收集关键令牌，选择性重新计算KV缓存。

Result: 在1M上下文长度下，REFORM在RULER和BABILong上分别实现超过50%和27%的性能提升，并在Infinite-Bench和MM-NIAH上优于基线。同时，推理时间减少30%，峰值内存使用降低5%。

Conclusion: REFORM在多样任务和领域中展现出高效性和卓越性能，为长上下文处理提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world
applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's
pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing
approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent
compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas
random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce
REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts
through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks
while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context
embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second,
it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and
selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves
over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M
context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH,
demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally,
REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving
both efficiency and superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估LLMs和人类在韩语语法上的语言能力，揭示当前LLMs在语言理解上的局限性，并探索提升其语言能力的潜在途径。

Method: 构建KoGEM基准，包含1.5k个选择题，覆盖5大类16小类，对27个不同规模和类型的LLMs进行零样本评估。

Result: LLMs在需要定义性知识的任务上表现良好，但在需要整合现实世界经验知识的任务（如音韵规则和发音）上表现不佳。

Conclusion: KoGEM不仅揭示了当前LLMs在语言能力上的局限性，还发现了LLMs在语言能力上的隐藏方面，为提升全面语言理解铺平了道路。

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar
\underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the
linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k
multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories.
The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that
while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily
definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of
real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and
pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating
such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs.
With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic
competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence,
paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and
dataset are available at: https://github.com/SungHo3268/KoGEM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在专家级任务上的表现尚未得到充分评估，尤其是在需要长文本输出和严格领域要求的场景下。

Method: 提出了ExpertLongBench基准，包含11个专家级任务，并设计了CLEAR评估框架，通过提取任务特定评分标准中的检查项来评估模型输出的准确性。

Result: 测试了11个大语言模型，表现最佳的模型F1分数仅为26.8%，显示现有模型在专家级任务上仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: ExpertLongBench和CLEAR为评估大语言模型在专家级任务上的表现提供了有效工具，揭示了模型在这些任务上的不足和改进方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing
11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and
applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in
ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and
strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in
ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to
specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose
CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form
model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned
evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by
extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric.
Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items
for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded
evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components
in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only
a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2)
models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often
not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR
can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医（TCM）因其隐含的推理、多样的文本形式和缺乏标准化，对计算建模和评估提出了挑战。目前缺乏针对TCM领域的系统性评估基准。

Method: 论文开发了MTCMB基准，包含12个子数据集，涵盖知识问答、语言理解、诊断推理、处方生成和安全性评估五大类别，结合真实案例记录、国家考试和经典文本。

Result: 初步结果显示，当前大语言模型在基础知识上表现良好，但在临床推理、处方规划和安全合规性方面表现不足。

Conclusion: MTCMB基准的推出填补了领域空白，有助于开发更专业和可信的医疗AI系统。所有数据集、代码和评估工具已公开。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with
millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global
healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning,
diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges
for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse
domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the
TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on
factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism.
To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs
on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with
certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major
categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning,
prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates
real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts,
providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models.
Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational
knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and
safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned
benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and
trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解哪些潜在条件导致特定结果对于批判性分析复杂事件结果的声称至关重要，但识别隐含条件并考察其对结果的影响具有挑战性。

Method: 结合并扩充两个现有数据集（目标和状态）的注释，通过研究问题和基于条件的推理任务探索条件的影响。

Result: 模型在生成和识别结果变异条件的能力上差异显著，影响其在条件替换缺失上下文时的结果验证表现。较大模型如GPT-4o在约束较少的情况下更为谨慎。

Conclusion: 条件在上下文不全时非常有用，不同规模的LLM在条件推理任务上表现不一，大型模型在低约束情境下表现更为保守。

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for
critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying
implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging.
We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing
datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of
conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks.
We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our
reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is
available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify
outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome
validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models
like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对FastText的内存优化框架，通过结合双数组字典树和标记-压缩垃圾回收原理，显著降低了内存使用，同时保持了嵌入质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastText在处理大规模工业部署时存在哈希冲突导致语义漂移和内存需求过高的问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 论文提出了一个四阶段算法：前缀字典树构建与嵌入映射、基于前缀的相似性压缩、基于后缀的相似性压缩以及标记-压缩内存重组。

Result: 在3000万中文词汇数据集上，内存使用从100GB降至约30GB，性能几乎无下降，工业部署中显著降低成本并提升模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 该优化框架有效解决了FastText的内存问题，为大规模工业应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word
representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling
out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its
hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale
industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory
requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world
vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive
memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory
management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures
and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the
linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit
highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language.
By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based
on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while
maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four
sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping,
prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and
mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million
Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to
approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial
deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and
improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

DeepSeek-R1 also exhibits increased vulnerability to bias, misinformation,
adversarial manipulation, and safety failures - especially in multilingual and
ethically sensitive contexts. This survey highlights the model's strengths,
including interpretability, scalability, and adaptability, alongside its
limitations in general language fluency and safety alignment. Future research
priorities include improving bias mitigation, natural language comprehension,
domain-specific validation, and regulatory compliance. Overall, DeepSeek-R1
represents a major advance in open, scalable AI, underscoring the need for
collaborative governance to ensure responsible and equitable deployment.

Motivation: 现有端到端语音识别模型对训练数据词汇存在偏好，导致专有名词和未知术语识别不准确。

Method: 在推理时利用中间层声学特征进行关键词检测，并通过通配符CTC实现快速模糊匹配，对检测到的关键词施加偏置。

Result: 在日语语音识别实验中，未知词的F1分数提升了29%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型即可有效提升罕见词识别性能，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output
tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate
recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we
propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in
CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems.
Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of
intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent
layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we
adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches,
allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since
this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily
applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech
recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for
unknown words.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习（ICL）在问答任务中有效，但在长文本生成任务（如摘要）中表现不佳。作者认为仅靠示范不足以教会模型任务语言和格式分布，需要显式暴露任务分布。

Method: 提出LongGuide框架，自动生成两类并行指导：优化自评估指标的度量指南（MGs）和约束生成输出的约束指南（OCGs），并自动选择最佳组合。

Result: LongGuide使开源和闭源LLM在零样本和少样本设置下性能提升超5%，具有可泛化性，并能与自动提示优化器协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过显式定义任务分布并生成结构化指导，LongGuide有效解决了ICL在生成任务中的局限性，为改进LLM性能提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of
pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task
performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning.
Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form
generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic
assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations
alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions
for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and
hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this
end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of
guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines
(MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output
Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and
sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of
guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in
both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable,
learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically
with automatic prompt optimizers.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型去毒方法通常依赖大规模非毒性数据训练、人工标注偏好数据或修改模型参数，这些方法计算成本高、鲁棒性差，且可能损害模型的流畅性和上下文理解能力。

Method: 利用紧凑的预训练校准模型，通过学习非毒性数据的去毒嵌入空间，轻量干预目标大语言模型的生成流程，引导其生成安全内容。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效降低毒性，同时保持合理的内容表达。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需一次性训练校准模型，即可无缝应用于多个大语言模型，且不损害流畅性或上下文理解，是一种高效的去毒解决方案。

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally
rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data,
designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying
the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally
expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for
LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model
that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight
intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding
space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM
away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time
training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to
multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding.
Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach
reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

TL;DR: 提出SPT框架，通过将预定义模式视为参数化工具，统一处理封闭、开放和按需信息抽取任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用信息抽取(UIE)方法在预定义模式选择和动态模式生成方面缺乏适应性，尤其在模式选择众多时表现不佳。

Method: SPT框架将模式作为参数化工具，支持模式检索、填充和生成三种操作，统一不同信息抽取任务。

Result: SPT能自适应处理四种不同IE任务，模式检索性能稳健，抽取效果与主流系统相当且参数更少。

Conclusion: SPT框架有效解决了UIE的模式适应性问题，为信息抽取提供了统一灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive
generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting
structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE
suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas
and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm,
especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we
propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called
Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling
capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for
tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be
applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema
Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema
Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or
Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments
show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively,
delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves
comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE
systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他语言，并开源了数据构建流程，支持未来多语言医学基准的开发。

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of
language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore
help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every
community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively
build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is
normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle
this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question
benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical
specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources,
including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually
annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels,
ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to
typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design
enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical
understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and
in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a
sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a
private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains
all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other
languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the
development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Conclusion: ConcernScope能有效帮助公共卫生官员识别和分析在线关切，提升应对效率。

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health
initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures
globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content,
what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it.
To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student
framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight
classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a
text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly,
automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is
built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public
health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided
data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online
community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example
time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency
before and after significant events.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化的规划和问答任务中超越最先进的专有语言模型3.45%。深层模型层的任务对齐显著改善，尤其在规划复杂度增加的未见场景中表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了语言模型在情景基础中的可扩展性和集成性问题，提升了模型在复杂规划任务中的表现，尤其在深层模型中表现出稳定的泛化能力。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn
from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current
episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration,
limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters).
While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical
representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a
fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities,
they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a
scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers
episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte
Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel
distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding
episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art
proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.
Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task
alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable
generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning
complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

TL;DR: 论文评估了64个大语言模型在心理危机热线任务中的表现，发现其在自杀倾向检测等结构化任务上表现优异，但情绪识别仍具挑战性。开源模型与闭源模型差距缩小，量化技术可高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理援助热线面临需求激增的挑战，需要探索大语言模型在情感敏感场景中的应用潜力，尤其是危机评估任务。

Method: 基于杭州心理援助热线540条标注文本构建PsyCrisisBench基准，测试64个模型在4项任务（情绪识别、自杀意念检测等）上的表现，采用零样本/小样本/微调范式，通过F1分数和Welch t检验评估。

Result: 模型在自杀意念检测(F1=0.880)、计划识别(0.779)和风险评估(0.907)表现强劲，微调后1.5B小模型可超越大模型。情绪识别上限仅0.709，开源模型多数任务表现接近闭源(p>0.3)，量化技术可节省70%显存。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在结构化心理危机评估中潜力显著，微调是关键。情绪识别受限于语境复杂性，开源模型与量化技术的进步为实际部署提供可行性。PsyCrisisBench为伦理部署提供评估框架。

Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face
significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could
support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive
contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540
annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,
assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,
suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across
15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,
few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with
statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on
suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),
and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood
status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost
vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)
surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like
QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though
closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled
with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with
minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured
psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition
remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open-
and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests
feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to
guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

TL;DR: 该论文提出动态代理方法和条件概念瓶颈模型（CoCoBMs），优化概念数量并提升分类准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）的概念库存在冗余或覆盖不足的问题，且传统CBMs的概念评分机制有局限性。

Method: 引入动态代理方法调整概念库，并提出条件概念瓶颈模型（CoCoBMs）改进概念评分机制。

Result: 在6个数据集上的评估显示，分类准确性提升6%，可解释性评估提升30%。

Conclusion: 动态概念库和CoCoBMs显著提升了CBMs的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a
process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in
CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts.
However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to
use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To
address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts
the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number
of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose
Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in
traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of
assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an
editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with
their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our
method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances
interpretability assessments by 30%.

Abstract: The emergence of ChatGPT marked a transformative milestone for Artificial
Intelligence (AI), showcasing the remarkable potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate human-like text. This wave of innovation has revolutionized
how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday
tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While
English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements,
the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs.
Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more
than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich
linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an
unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities.
The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from
rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This
article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present
day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and
public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that
ALLMs present for the Arab world.

TL;DR: 论文提出TurnBench基准测试，通过多轮交互式代码破解任务评估大语言模型的多步推理能力，发现现有模型在复杂推理任务上表现显著落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮或单步任务，无法评估现实场景中所需的迭代推理能力。为填补这一空白，作者设计了TurnBench来测试模型的多轮、多步推理能力。

Method: 采用受'图灵机桌游'启发的代码破解任务，包含经典模式和噩梦模式两种难度。任务要求模型通过多轮猜测和结构化反馈逐步推理隐藏规则，并提供中间步骤的标注数据。

Result: 最佳模型在经典模式准确率达81.5%，但在噩梦模式骤降至17.8%。人类参与者则在两种模式下均达到100%准确率，显示出当前模型与人类推理能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: TurnBench通过引入反馈循环和隐藏任务规则，有效降低了数据污染风险，为诊断和提升大语言模型的多步推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing
benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture
the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates
multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task
inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must
uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses,
receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds.
This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past
information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored
in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests
standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and
requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we
provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model
achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in
Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both,
underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating
feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and
provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn
reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种细粒度流程图归因方法FlowPathAgent，通过图推理减少LLM在流程图分析中的幻觉，并创建了评估基准FlowExplainBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图在关键领域（如物流、医疗和工程）中至关重要，但LLM在解析时易产生视觉幻觉，导致不可靠的决策路径分析。

Method: 提出FlowPathAgent神经符号代理，将流程图分割并转换为符号图，通过动态交互生成归因路径，确保可验证性。

Result: 实验显示FlowPathAgent在FlowExplainBench上比基线性能提升10-14%，有效减少视觉幻觉。

Conclusion: FlowPathAgent通过细粒度归因提升了LLM对流程图的可解释性和可靠性，为自动化处理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes.
However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships
make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models
frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when
analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated
flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and
engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which
traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.
Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves
explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We
propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post
hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,
then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic
approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.
Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating
flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.
Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in
LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our
proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在数学推理任务中，仅使用负样本强化学习（NSR）比传统强化学习方法更有效，能提升模型性能且保持多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在语言模型推理任务中的机制，特别是正确和错误样本对模型性能的影响，以优化训练策略。

Method: 将强化学习信号分解为正样本强化（PSR）和负样本强化（NSR），并在数学推理数据集上训练模型，分析梯度变化。

Result: 仅使用NSR训练能显著提升模型性能，尤其在多样本推理任务中表现优异，而仅使用PSR会降低多样性。

Conclusion: 负样本强化学习在优化语言模型推理任务中具有重要作用，通过抑制错误生成并重新分配概率质量来提升性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long
chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model
using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better
understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing
correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and
Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train
Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a
surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing
correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves
performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to
$256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing
only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher
$k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that
solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than
previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by
suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward
other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the
model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that
upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$
performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at
https://github.com/TianHongZXY/RLVR-Decomposed.

Result: 实验表明，使用KokoroChat微调开源大语言模型能显著提升生成心理咨询回复的质量及对话自动评估效果。

Conclusion: 角色扮演方法能有效构建高质量心理咨询数据集，为语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用提供了可靠数据支持。

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies
heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require
strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may
raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using
large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue
datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and
authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing
approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions,
ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this
method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue
dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive
client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source
LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling
responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat
dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的虚假内容（幻觉）阻碍了其在关键领域的应用，亟需有效检测方法。

Method: 基于最大均值差异（MMD）的非参数分布距离，通过追踪不同温度参数下生成文档的MMD轨迹来检测幻觉。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测大部分幻觉内容，性能优于自然基线。

Conclusion: MMD-Flagger为检测大语言模型幻觉提供了一种有效的新方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet,
a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their
propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in
reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest
importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content,
MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric
distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks
the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various
temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this
trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is
benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms
natural competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（训练时调整和测试时适应）无法充分发挥基于提示的对话查询重构潜力，尤其是在黑盒系统（如商业LLM API）中效果有限。

Method: 使用对比排序损失训练轻量级奖励模型，在推理时通过测试时适应选择最优查询重构方案（AdaRewriter框架）。

Result: 在五个对话搜索数据集上，AdaRewriter在多数设定中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 测试时适应对对话查询重构具有重要潜力，AdaRewriter框架为黑盒系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful
approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into
standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated
candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability.
However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation
approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we
propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an
outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a
lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the
most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate
effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on
five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly
outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the
potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

COMET, and BLASER) and human assessments. The pipelines included automatic
speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis, with local
models and cloud-based commercial ones. Some components have been fine-tuned on

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains,
where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses
emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help
mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4),
raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to
untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining
Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for
training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization
without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage
adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to
collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are
used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation
capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The
resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs,
enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement.
Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text
comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial
improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a
privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with
self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the
effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as
efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full
dataset used in our experiments.

*Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于提示的文本嵌入模型生成的嵌入维度高且冗余，研究发现即使大幅降维对分类和聚类任务性能影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于提示的文本嵌入模型虽然性能优异，但生成的嵌入维度高达数千，导致存储和计算成本高昂。本文旨在探究降维对这些嵌入在不同任务中性能的影响。

Method: 采用后验降维方法，分析嵌入在分类、聚类、检索和语义文本相似性任务中的性能变化，并通过本征维度和各向同性分析冗余性。

Result: 实验表明，即使仅保留25%的维度，性能下降非常小；分类和聚类任务在降维至0.5%以下时性能仍几乎不受影响，且这两类任务的嵌入本征维度更低、各向同性更弱。

Conclusion: 基于提示的文本嵌入存在高度冗余，尤其分类和聚类任务可通过大幅降维节省成本而不显著影响性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings
upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of
dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of
embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc
dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of
various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification,
clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our
experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only
the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight
performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant.
Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to
less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is
very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis
based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our
analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are
considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic
dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: This paper reports on the development of a large-scale speech recognition
model, Whale. Similar to models such as Whisper and OWSM, Whale leverages both
a large model size and a diverse, extensive dataset. Whale's architecture
integrates w2v-BERT self-supervised model, an encoder-decoder backbone built on
E-Branchformer, and a joint CTC-attention decoding strategy. The training
corpus comprises varied speech data, of not only public corpora but also
in-house data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to different speaking
styles and acoustic conditions. Through evaluations on multiple benchmarks,
Whale achieved comparable performance to existing models. In particular, it
achieves a word error rate of 2.4% on the Librispeech test-clean set and a
character error rate of 3.4% on the CSJ eval3 set, outperforming Whisper
large-v3 and OWSM v3.1.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions
for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer
preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task.
Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a
crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning
over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich
or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive
analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a
domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document
filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins
and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and
quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed
framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering
documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity
extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia
Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or
dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates
co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities,
concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a
holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business
context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building
box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk
monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize
the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in
association mining business applications for institutions.

Conclusion: 本研究为更灵活和可扩展的语用语言模型指明了方向，同时强调了平衡神经与符号组件的关键设计考虑。

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on
hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to
real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances
probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and
evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual
specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we
systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into
the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to
generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can
match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in
predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic
model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are
particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract
goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic
evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of
pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for
balancing neural and symbolic components.

Conclusion: LLM生成的去毒文本可作为人工标注的有效替代方案，PARADEHATE数据集的发布为仇恨言论去毒研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text,
has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content
online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially
for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human
annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline
leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the
ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the
LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct
PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech
detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate
text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results
show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better
performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating
the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable
alternative to human annotation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于论点中心因果干预（ACCI）的新方法，用于解决跨文档事件共指消解中的虚假相关性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前跨文档事件共指消解方法主要依赖触发词特征，导致词汇特征与共指关系之间的虚假相关性，影响模型性能。

Method: ACCI方法通过构建结构因果图揭示词汇触发词与共指标签之间的混杂依赖，并引入后门调整干预来隔离论点语义的真实因果效应。此外，还集成了反事实推理模块和论点感知增强模块。

Result: ACCI在ECB+和GVC数据集上分别达到了88.4%和85.2%的CoNLL F1分数，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ACCI在统一的端到端框架中有效去偏，无需改变基础训练过程，显著提升了跨文档事件共指消解的性能。

Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event
mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence.
However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features
within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between
surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the
overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric
Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal
graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and
coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate
the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious
correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies
the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware
enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded
information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data
augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in
a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training
procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of
88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The
implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言环境下预训练模型和大型语言模型在定义建模任务中的表现，填补多语言研究的空白，并验证跨语言协同效应的可能性。

Method: 使用四种语言（西班牙语、法语、葡萄牙语、德语）的单语词典数据，对预训练多语言模型进行微调，并采用零样本方法测试两种流行的大型语言模型。

Result: 多语言模型表现与英语相当但未能利用跨语言协同效应，大型语言模型整体表现更优；人类评估揭示了LLMs在零样本和少样本任务中的能力与不足。

Conclusion: 定义建模任务中，BERTScore与多语言LLM基准表现强相关，可作为计算受限场景下的稳定自然替代评估方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition
modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish,
French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test
the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition
modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a
zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular
chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that
multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot
leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better
performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated
definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in
this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that
performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on
multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable
compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

Motivation: 当前LLM的价值评估和对齐受限于西方文化偏见和不完善的国内框架，且缺乏可扩展的规则驱动场景生成方法，导致跨文化评估成本高且不足。

Method: 提出基于中国核心价值观的分层价值框架（3个主要维度、12个核心价值和50个衍生价值），构建包含25万条价值规则的中文价值观语料库（CVC），并通过人工标注增强和扩展。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了具有中国文化适应性的价值评估和对齐基准框架，为LLM的安全和可持续发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at

Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static
methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We
introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the
adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper
model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a
learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select
task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy
significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks,
demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

Result: 实验显示大语言模型生成认知情态表达的能力有限且不稳定，其不确定性表达不可靠。

Conclusion: 为构建具有不确定性意识的大语言模型，需丰富其对认知情态的语义知识。

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not
know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In
contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate
corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an
uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to
estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is
lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty
encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological
frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic
modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance
of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and
hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable.
To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge
of epistemic modality in LLMs.

Motivation: 在线表单填写是一项常见但劳动密集型的任务，现有工具多为基于规则且缺乏通用生成能力。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在通用GUI任务中展现出潜力，但在表单填写任务中面临布局灵活性和文本指令与字段对齐等独特挑战。

Method: 论文正式定义了表单填写任务，并提出FormFactory——一个包含基于Web的界面、后端评估模块和精心构建数据集的交互式基准测试套件，覆盖多样化的真实场景和字段格式，模拟高保真的表单交互。

Result: 对最先进的MLLMs进行全面评估后发现，没有模型的准确率超过5%，突显了任务的固有难度，并揭示了当前模型在视觉布局推理和字段值对齐能力上的显著局限。

Conclusion: FormFactory基准测试套件可作为进一步研究鲁棒、实用表单填写代理的基石，推动相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive
keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating
this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and
lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related
tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique
challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of
aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we
formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive
benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module,
and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world
scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form
interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs
and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent
difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in
current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We
hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into
robust, practical form-filling agents.

Motivation: 现有的基于角色扮演和人物设定的聊天方法依赖静态角色描述和低质量合成数据，难以捕捉人类对话中的动态细微特征。

Method: 提出Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE)框架，包含变分自编码模块和细粒度控制空间，动态调整对话行为。同时构建高质量数据集HumanChatData和基准测试HumanChatBench。

Result: 实验表明，基于V-VAE的大型语言模型在HumanChatBench和DialogBench上 consistently 优于标准基线模型。

Conclusion: V-VAE框架和HumanChatData有效解决了人类对话中动态细微特征的建模问题，提升了对话生成的质量。

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based
chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only
linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific
traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat
approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal
space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic
fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling
subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and
evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily
learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these
limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework,
containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space
which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained,
interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and
personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData,
and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in
the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently
outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities
of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from
three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting
human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To
address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset

includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the
reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data
generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent
collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000
synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems.
Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them.
Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$
(Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN
provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training
resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于双语词典的跨语言词汇迁移方法，适用于低资源语言，通过逐步移除目标子词并迭代估计其嵌入，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言上表现不佳，而双语词典资源丰富，因此探索如何利用词典实现高效的跨语言词汇迁移。

Method: 利用BPE分词器的特性，逐步移除目标子词并回退到更短的子词，通过迭代估计目标子词的嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低资源语言上优于现有方法，验证了基于词典的跨语言词汇迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于双语词典的词汇迁移方法简单有效，特别适合低资源语言，为跨语言模型适配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting
pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages.
Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face
challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we
propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes
bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to
descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE
tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to
shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively
by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results
show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages,
demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for
cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

*Li Zhou,Lutong Yu,Dongchu Xie,Shaohuan Cheng,Wenyan Li,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Hanfu-Bench，一个专家策划的多模态数据集，用于研究视觉语言模型在时间文化理解和创造性适应方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于视觉语言模型文化理解的研究主要强调地理多样性，而忽视了时间维度。为了填补这一空白，作者引入了Hanfu-Bench数据集，以汉服为代表，研究中国文化的时间维度及其在当代社会中的流行。

Method: Hanfu-Bench包含两个核心任务：文化视觉理解和文化图像转创。前者通过多选题视觉问答考察时间文化特征的识别，后者则关注将传统服饰元素转化为现代设计。

Result: 评估显示，封闭式视觉语言模型在文化视觉理解上与非专家相当，但比专家落后10%，开放式模型表现更差。在转创任务中，最佳模型的成功率仅为42%。

Conclusion: Hanfu-Bench为时间文化理解和创造性适应提供了重要测试平台，揭示了这一新方向上的重大挑战。

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and
time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language
models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the
critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a
novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning
ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that
reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining
highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core
tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The
former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or
multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the
latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through
cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation
shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural
understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags
further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human
evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of
only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant
challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and
creative adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，在复杂预测任务中，简单的提示工程改进对提升大语言模型准确率效果有限，某些策略甚至会产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在复杂预测任务中，低成本提示工程是否足以替代耗时昂贵的技术（如微调）来提升大语言模型表现。

Method: 两项研究：1) 在4个主流模型上测试38种提示；2) 引入复合提示和外部来源提示，并加入推理模型o1系列。

Result: 大多数提示改进收效甚微，仅基准率引用略有帮助；令人惊讶的是贝叶斯推理提示会显著降低准确率。

Conclusion: 复杂预测任务需要更专业的技术支持，基础提示优化难以带来实质性性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways.
Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are
time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly
cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt
engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show
that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a
minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5
Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we
introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including
the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to
negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits.
Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy:
especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results
suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt
refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized
techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI
forecasting.

Method: 研究构建了首个公开的乌尔都语假新闻基准数据集，并采用XLNet、mBERT等预训练大语言模型进行评估，同时提出了一种结合多种嵌入和特征提取技术的统一模型。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的统一模型在准确率、F1分数等指标上优于其他对比模型。数据集和模型性能均通过人工验证确保可靠性。

Conclusion: 该研究为乌尔都语假新闻检测提供了首个公开基准数据集和高效模型，为资源匮乏语言的假新闻检测研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the
dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of
fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts
predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in
resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu.
Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately
labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces
substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of
validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often
domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human
verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which
compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights
the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent
Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other
resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large
FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep
analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art
pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa,
RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model
that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction
techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1
score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of
news.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过Statement Tuning方法使编码器模型（如BERT、RoBERTa）在零样本和少样本任务中达到与大型语言模型（LLMs）相媲美的性能，尤其在多语言NLP任务中验证了其高效性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管编码器模型（如BERT、RoBERTa）在计算和内存成本上优于大型语言模型（LLMs），但其在零样本和少样本任务中的表现较差。本文旨在探索编码器模型是否可以通过Statement Tuning方法在多语言NLP任务中实现零样本跨语言泛化，并成为资源密集型LLMs的高效替代方案。

Method: 采用Statement Tuning方法，将任务重新表述为有限模板，以适应编码器模型的零样本泛化能力，并特别关注多语言NLP任务中的数据集设计、效率提升和语言特定泛化。

Result: 实验结果表明，先进的编码器模型在多语言环境中表现出色，其性能与多语言LLMs相当，同时具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: 通过Statement Tuning方法，编码器模型可以在多语言NLP任务中实现高效的零样本泛化，为资源受限的语言提供了更具包容性和资源效率的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but
achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa
has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer
advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts
them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates
tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP,
exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization
and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource
languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize
well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient.
We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains,
and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and
resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Conclusion: 这是首次将MMD应用于词义变化检测，提出的方法在识别和解释词义演变方面表现出色。

Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the
linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of
identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper
proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) to select semantically meaningful variables and quantify
changes across time periods. This method enables both the identification of
words undergoing sense shifts and the explanation of their evolution over
multiple historical periods. To my knowledge, this is the first application of
MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言缺乏高质量的RAG系统，主要因为缺少评估基准和训练数据。现有资源多集中于英语或高资源语言，难以扩展到印度多样的语言环境。

Method: 通过手动翻译MS MARCO-dev集中的1000个查询，创建了IndicMSMarco多语言评估基准；利用先进LLM从19种印度语言维基百科构建大规模训练数据集，并加入MS MARCO数据集的翻译版本。

Result: 构建了IndicMSMarco评估基准和包含19种印度语言的大规模训练数据集，资源已在Hugging Face上公开。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了印度语言RAG系统的资源空白，为多语言信息检索和生成任务提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access
relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually
informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of
high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1)
evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale
training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and
datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it
difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of
India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a
multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation
in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries
from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a
large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from
the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs.
Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset
to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world
information-seeking tasks. Resources are available here:

Motivation: 研究发现，在关键词对分类标签预测至关重要的应用中，BERT基于上下文的词嵌入可能不足以生成具有区分性的文本表示，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 论文开发了一种基于领域特定词汇知识的词嵌入增强模型，将BERT词嵌入投影到一个新的空间，最大化类内相似性和类间差异，并提出了从在线开放资源自动收集词汇知识的算法。

Result: 在情感分析、情绪识别和问答三个分类任务上的实验结果表明，所提出的词嵌入增强模型有效提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合领域特定词汇知识增强BERT词嵌入，显著提高了在关键词敏感的分类任务中的表现，为相关应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in
many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification
applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not
lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where
keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our
investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the
context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough
to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by
this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using
domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement
model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class
similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the
knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge
acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from
online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have
shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测方法主要依赖长文本内容，如原始新闻文章和用户评论，但在更现实的场景中，往往只有简短的推文及其转发用户信息可用。

Method: MVAN模型结合了文本语义注意力和传播结构注意力，能够从源推文内容和传播结构中捕获关键信息，并识别假新闻中的关键词和可疑用户。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，MVAN模型的准确率平均比现有最优方法高出2.5%，并能提供合理的解释。

Conclusion: MVAN模型在假新闻检测任务中表现出色，尤其在处理简短文本和传播结构时具有优势，为社交媒体上的假新闻识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's
society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long
text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper
solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only
source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user
comments. We develop a novel neural network based model,
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to
detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model
includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which
ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet
content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in
the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in
the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets,
and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a
reasonable explanation.

Method: 分析三个多语言模型的参数空间，通过探测实验追踪神经元在预训练中的发展，观察语言识别能力和语义概念的跨语言对齐。

Result: 发现模型表示从语言特定逐渐收敛为跨语言抽象，并识别出可预测多语言相同概念的特定神经元。

Conclusion: 多语言模型通过预训练自然形成跨语言表示，神经元逐步对齐语义，支持无监督的跨语言知识迁移。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities
to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit
cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to
study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns
consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific
representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as
training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition
from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more
specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that
encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during
pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we
identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for
the same concepts across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对ESG和可持续性主题的大语言模型评估基准，ESGenius旨在填补这一空白，提升模型在跨学科领域的理解和回答能力。

Method: 构建ESGenius-QA（1136道选择题）和ESGenius-Corpus（231份权威文档），采用零样本和RAG两阶段评估协议，测试50个不同规模的LLM。

Result: 零样本设置下模型准确率仅55-70%，RAG方法显著提升性能（如14B模型从63.82%升至80.46%），证明权威知识增强的必要性。

Conclusion: ESGenius是首个ESG主题的LLM基准，验证了RAG技术在跨学科知识整合中的有效性，为可持续AI发展提供工具。

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing
the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius
comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136
multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain
experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each
question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling
transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231
foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from
seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and
adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging
from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models
achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs
in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant
performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example,
"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\%
with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in
authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our
knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多语言环境下大语言模型文化知识获取的机制，发现高低资源语言间文化知识转移存在不对称性，并提出频率假说解释此现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究评估大语言模型处理全球文化多样性的能力，但其在多语言环境下文化知识获取的机制仍不明确。本文旨在探究语言适应过程中文化知识如何在语言间转移。

Method: 引入了一个可解释的框架来研究文化知识转移，确保训练数据的透明度并控制转移效应。研究聚焦于四种非英语文化，分析高低资源语言间的双向转移。

Result: 研究发现英语与其他高资源语言之间存在双向文化转移，而低资源语言主要向英语单向转移知识。通过分析训练语料，验证了文化知识在预训练数据中出现频率越高越容易转移的假说。

Conclusion: 文化知识转移的不对称性可由频率假说解释，这为理解大语言模型在多语言环境下的文化知识获取机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language
models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their
cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain
unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge
transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an
interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data
transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four
non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between
English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages
primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain
this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural
knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more
easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

TL;DR: 论文提出StochasTok，一种随机分词方案，通过训练时随机分割token提升大语言模型对子词结构的理解能力，显著改进多项子词级任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在子词级任务（如字母计数、拼写错误识别等）上表现不佳，主要因传统分词方式掩盖了词汇的细粒度结构。现有改进方法（如字符级分词）计算成本高且效果不稳定。

Method: 提出StochasTok——在训练过程中随机分割token的轻量级随机分词方案，使模型能学习词汇内部结构，且支持在预训练的任何阶段无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明：1) 使用StochasTok预训练的模型在字符计数、子串识别等任务中性能显著提升；2) 对已预训练模型进行StochasTok后训练同样有效，避免从头预训练的高成本。

Conclusion: StochasTok以极小改动实现显著效果，在更大规模模型中具备应用潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including
understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming,
and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often
struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in
'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which
obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as
character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase
computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we
revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic
tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs
to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with
StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple
subword-level language games, including character counting, substring
identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows
seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate
that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding
into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch.
These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok
holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code

Result: 研究发现，基于LLM的协作系统在情感计算中表现出色，能够有效提升情感理解和生成的性能，尤其在复杂情感推理中展现出更强的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统探索了LLM在情感计算中的协作智能，为开发更接近人类社交智能的强大应用铺平了道路。未来研究应进一步解决协作系统中的挑战，如文化差异和决策幻觉问题，以推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human
emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in
natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline
architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to
inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to
affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for
dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in
affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual
emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these
challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that
emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like
affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking
that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide
a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring
from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it
includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on
collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2)
Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative
tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting
the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in
complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future
research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to
systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the
way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social
intelligence.

### [204] [mdok of KInIT: Robustly Fine-tuned LLM for Binary and Multiclass AI-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01702)
*Dominik Macko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于微调小型LLMs的文本分类方法mdok，用于检测机器生成文本，并在Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025的两个子任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）能生成高质量的多语言文本，这些文本常难以被人类识别为机器生成，存在滥用风险（如抄袭、垃圾邮件、传播虚假信息）。自动化检测可辅助人类识别机器生成文本，但其对分布外数据的鲁棒性仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用微调小型LLMs进行文本分类的方法mdok，应用于Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025的两个子任务。

Result: 在二元检测和多元分类（人类-AI协作的各种案例）中均表现出色，其中多元分类排名第一。

Conclusion: mdok方法在机器生成文本检测中表现出卓越的鲁棒性和性能，尤其在处理分布外数据时。

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in
multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as
generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g.,
plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to
assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness
to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our
mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text
classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI
Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as
in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI
collaboration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM训练中公平性动态变化，提出新指标评估偏见，发现大模型偏见更严重，早期停止可提升公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(LLM)训练中的公平性动态，旨在诊断偏见并通过训练干预（如早期停止）来缓解偏见。

Method: 引入两个新指标（平均排名和按部分计算的Jensen-Shannon散度）来全面评估预训练期间的公平性动态，应用于Pythia模型在WinoBias数据集上的性别预测偏见分析。

Result: 发现Pythia-6.9b对男性有偏见，训练中预测男性的性能和置信度更高；通过早期停止，可用1.7%的准确率换取92.5%的公平性提升；更大的模型表现出更多偏见。

Conclusion: 监控公平性动态可有效诊断和缓解LLM偏见，早期停止是一种可行的干预手段，且模型规模与偏见程度相关。

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training
to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training
interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and
do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics
to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average
Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights
into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of
occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that
(1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident
predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping,
Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in
fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more
assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not
specified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在表格推理任务中存在泛化性不足和鲁棒性差的问题，主要源于模仿学习中的固有偏差。为此，作者探索强化学习在表格推理中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过严格的数据预处理、基于规则的奖励设计以及跨任务统一训练策略，构建表格推理大语言模型。

Result: 在表格推理基准上超越Claude-3.7-Sonnet达4.0%，在BIRD文本转SQL任务中7B模型达到68.3%准确率，同时显著提升模型泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能有效解决表格推理任务中的泛化瓶颈，Reasoning-Table为小模型实现超越商业大模型的性能提供了新范式。

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact
verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured
tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for
effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved
notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to
biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first
application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward
design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple
rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks.
Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a
robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary
models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The
approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching
68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments
demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization
capabilities and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中自我反思能力不足，现有反思方法简单且反馈质量有限，需要改进。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 构建高质量反思数据集；2) 在GRPO框架中引入新奖励机制，鼓励简洁有意义的反思。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，SRPO显著优于现有模型，推理准确性和反思质量均有提升。

Conclusion: SRPO有效提升了多模态大语言模型的自我反思和推理能力，为复杂任务提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit
self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal
text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and
struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning
ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during
initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal
Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework
explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we
construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an
advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help
the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage,
we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages
concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy.
Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B
and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning
accuracy and reflection quality.

TL;DR: 该论文通过机制解释性工具分析了LLama3.2-1B-base模型如何处理习语的非组合性比喻意义与字面意义的歧义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语因其非组合性的比喻意义与字面意义的强烈差异，对语言模型提出了独特挑战。研究旨在揭示模型如何处理这种歧义。

Method: 使用机制解释性工具，追踪大型预训练因果变换器（LLama3.2-1B-base）处理习语歧义的过程。

Result: 模型通过早期注意力层和MLP子层检索习语的比喻意义，特定注意力头增强比喻意义并抑制字面解释。模型通过中间路径表示比喻意义，同时保留字面解释的并行路径。

Conclusion: 研究为自回归变换器中习语理解的机制提供了证据，展示了模型如何处理习语的歧义性。

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their
non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the
idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn
representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a
figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic
interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer
(LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom
processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early
attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost
the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal
interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation
through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards
literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall,
our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an
autoregressive transformer.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Common Corpus，一个用于语言模型预训练的最大开放数据集，包含约两万亿个无版权或允许许可的标记，支持多语言和代码数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练数据常包含受版权或专有内容，阻碍了在AI法规下的使用，因此需要合规的开放数据。

Method: 通过收集无版权或允许许可的数据，并进行详细的过滤和整理，构建了Common Corpus数据集。

Result: Common Corpus包含约两万亿标记，涵盖多种语言和代码数据，已被Anthropic等公司用于LLM训练。

Conclusion: Common Corpus将成为LLM开放科学研究的关键基础设施，支持研究和商业需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from
different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of
tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders
the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly
open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In
this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language
model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either
uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion
tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main
European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training
datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity
of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths
for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In
this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling
and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such
industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe
that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science
research in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在数值任务中存在数字偏差，源于预训练数据的长尾分布，通过修剪特定神经元可部分纠正错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在基础数值问题上常出错。受本福德定律启发，研究假设预训练数据中的数字分布偏差导致模型生成偏向。

Method: 首先验证预训练数据是否符合本福德定律，构建均匀数字分布的基准测试，通过logit-lens和神经元分析追踪偏差来源，并修剪相关神经元。

Result: 主流开源模型表现出类似本福德定律的数字偏差，主要由深层网络中少数高度数字选择性的FFN神经元引起，修剪后可部分纠正错误输出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语料库统计与模型符号错误间的关联，为诊断和缓解数值任务中的幻觉提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems,
producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern
where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize
that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be
learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To
investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in
pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an
evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across
seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles
Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we
identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly
digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced
overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal
evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model
behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level
statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for
diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为角色感知推理（RAR）的新方法，通过角色身份激活（RIA）和推理风格优化（RSO）两阶段解决角色扮演代理（RPAs）中的注意力分散和风格漂移问题，显著提升了RPAs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的角色扮演代理（RPAs）通常基于显式对话数据构建，缺乏深层次的人类内部思维过程，导致知识和风格表达肤浅。大型推理模型（LRMs）虽可用于模拟角色思维，但直接应用时存在注意力分散（即RPAs忘记角色）和风格漂移（即推理过于正式和僵化，而非符合角色特点的推理）的问题。

Method: 本文提出的角色感知推理（RAR）方法包含两个关键阶段：角色身份激活（RIA）和推理风格优化（RSO）。RIA在推理过程中通过角色档案明确引导模型以对抗注意力分散，RSO则通过LRM蒸馏将推理风格与角色和场景对齐以缓解风格漂移。

Result: 大量实验表明，RAR方法通过有效解决注意力分散和风格漂移问题，显著提升了RPAs的性能。

Conclusion: RAR方法通过角色身份激活和推理风格优化两阶段设计，成功解决了RPAs中的注意力分散和风格漂移问题，为角色扮演代理的进一步发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional
companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on
explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes,
resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct
application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role)
and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than
character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two
important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style
Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles
during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns
reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate
style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR
significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing
attention diversion and style drift.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kwak'wala语是加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省的一种土著语言，拥有丰富的文献记录，但这些早期文本以图像形式存在，无法被机器读取。数字化这些文本有助于现代拼写转换和语言技术开发。

Method: 论文采用现成的OCR技术、语言识别和掩码技术来分离Kwak'wala文本，并结合后校正模型，以生成高质量的转录。

Result: 通过结合多种技术，论文成功实现了对Kwak'wala文本的高质量数字化转录。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合OCR技术和后处理方法可以有效处理Kwak'wala语的早期文本，为语言复兴和技术开发提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich
legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active
community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language
revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the
collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain
unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character
recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern
orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper,
we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only
accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations
necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building
on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods,
language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text,
along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality
transcription.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing, the ability to follow instructions has emerged as a key metric for
evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often
focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences
present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we
introduce MaXIFE: a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess
instruction-following capabilities across 23 languages with 1,667 verifiable
instruction tasks. MaXIFE integrates both Rule-Based Evaluation and Model-Based
Evaluation, ensuring a balance of efficiency and accuracy. We applied MaXIFE to
evaluate several leading commercial and open-source LLMs, establishing baseline
results for future comparisons. By providing a standardized tool for
multilingual instruction-following evaluation, MaXIFE aims to advance research

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在事实性错误，而知识图谱可提供透明可更新的知识基础。多跳推理面临保持推理路径连贯性和避免过早丢弃关键连接两大挑战。

Method: 开发iQUEST框架：1) 问题引导的迭代查询分解；2) 集成GNN在每一步预看2跳邻居信息。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和四种LLM上验证了iQUEST的持续性能提升。

Conclusion: iQUEST通过结构化推理轨迹和前瞻性信息整合，有效增强了复杂知识推理的可靠性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing
tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge
graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable
reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons
over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries.
However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent
reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop
connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided
KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler
sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory.
Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and
incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual
approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore
viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent
improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Motivation: 当前对基础模型的评估主要依赖客观指标，如测验成绩，忽视了真实的人类体验。为了弥补这一不足，作者提出了一种以人为中心的评估框架，旨在更全面地反映模型的实际表现。

Method: 作者提出了HCE框架，聚焦三个核心维度：问题解决能力、信息质量和交互体验。通过540多次参与者驱动的评估，人类与模型在开放式研究任务中协作，生成了一个全面的主观数据集。

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective
metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this
model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to
reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a
Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core
dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction
experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3,
and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where
humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a
comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback
across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and
adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by
Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a
novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective
evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized,
automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical
scenarios. Our dataset link is

Motivation: 研究语法书在极低资源语言翻译中的有效性，尤其是语法规则检索和应用的具体作用。

Method: 分解翻译过程为语法规则检索和应用两步，引入ZhuangRules数据集，并将语法规则表示为代码函数以优化LLM的推理能力。

Result: 代码规则显著提升了规则检索和应用，最终使翻译BLEU分数提高了13.1%。

Conclusion: 将语法规则编码为函数形式能有效解决LLM在复杂规则处理上的困难，显著提升极低资源语言的翻译质量。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating
extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the
effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the
role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by
decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To
facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of
grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that
rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation.
Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly
provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To
address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code
functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code
in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules
significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting
in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

Conclusion: 研究增进了对信息战动态的理解，并为未来军事冲突中社交媒体影响研究提供了方法。

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military
engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media
platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in
shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from
propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war,
February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We
utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess
the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset
with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate
distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at
different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ
emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust,
whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting
and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of
accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of
coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding
of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies
on social media influence in military conflicts.

Method: 结合预训练模块：语音到LLM嵌入投影器和LoRA适配器，并在多语言多模态数据上进行指令微调。

Result: 系统成功提交评估，能够处理多种语言任务。

Conclusion: 通过结合预训练模块和微调，开发出高效的多任务语音处理系统。

Abstract: In this paper we describe NAVER LABS Europe submission to the
instruction-following speech processing short track at IWSLT 2025. We
participate in the constrained settings, developing systems that can
simultaneously perform ASR, ST, and SQA tasks from English speech input into
the following target languages: Chinese, Italian, and German. Our solution
leverages two pretrained modules: (1) a speech-to-LLM embedding projector
trained using representations from the SeamlessM4T-v2-large speech encoder; and
(2) LoRA adapters trained on text data on top of a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. These
modules are jointly loaded and further instruction-tuned for 1K steps on
multilingual and multimodal data to form our final system submitted for
evaluation.

### [219] [Analysis of LLM Bias (Chinese Propaganda & Anti-US Sentiment) in DeepSeek-R1 vs. ChatGPT o3-mini-high](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01814)
*PeiHsuan Huang,ZihWei Lin,Simon Imbot,WenCheng Fu,Ethan Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了PRC对齐的DeepSeek-R1与非PRC的ChatGPT o3-mini-high在宣传和反美情绪上的偏见，发现DeepSeek-R1存在显著偏见，尤其在简体中文中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）对公众理解和公民决策的影响日益增强，但其意识形态中立性引发担忧。现有研究缺乏对不同地缘政治对齐模型的跨语言直接比较，特别是PRC系统模型与非PRC模型的对比。

Method: 研究开发了包含1,200个去语境化、推理导向问题的语料库，涵盖简体中文、繁体中文和英文。通过结合GPT-4o评分和人工标注的混合评估流程，对两个模型的7,200个回答进行分析。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在宣传和反美情绪上表现出显著高于ChatGPT o3-mini-high的偏见，尤其在简体中文中。其偏见不仅限于政治话题，还渗透到文化和生活方式内容中。

Conclusion: 研究表明，LLMs存在模型级别和语言依赖的偏见，PRC对齐模型在简体中文中偏见尤为明显，且这种偏见具有广泛性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and
civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While
existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct,
cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical
alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has
been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating
DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for
Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus
of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from
Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a
hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human
annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent
biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of
both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which
remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda
levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias
rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in
English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to
Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its
Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore,
such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated
cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

TL;DR: Team BD 在 BEA 2025 共享任务中提交了基于 MPNet 的 AI 导师能力评估系统，通过集成学习和交叉验证在错误识别和定位任务上取得了较好成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在评估 AI 导师在教育对话中识别和定位学生错误的能力，以提升教育对话系统的可靠性。

Method: 使用 MPNet 模型，结合 BERT 和 XLNet 的优势，通过类加权交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡，并采用 10 折分组交叉验证和硬投票集成方法。

Result: 在官方测试集上，错误识别和错误定位的宏 F1 分数分别达到约 0.7110 和 0.5543。

Conclusion: 该集成学习方法为教育对话中导师响应评估系统的设计提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical
Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification)
and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification
of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly
recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the
mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based
language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We
fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to
handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to
maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between
training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best
models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by
combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both
tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake
Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We
include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion
matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as
a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach
and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response
evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和大型语言模型的发展，自动化日常任务如自动写作受到关注。然而，模型在理解职场专业幽默方面的能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 开发了一个包含专业幽默语句及其适当性特征的数据集，并评估了五种大型语言模型的表现。

Result: 评估显示，大型语言模型在准确判断幽默适当性方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前的大型语言模型在处理职场专业幽默方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is
getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs
with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used
in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a
dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the
appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs
often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

TL;DR: 本文提出CiteEval框架，用于细粒度引用评估，并构建CiteBench基准和CiteEval-Auto自动评估工具，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言推理（NLI）的引用评估方法存在局限性，无法全面评估引用质量，影响信息检索系统的可信度和效果。

Method: 提出CiteEval框架，结合引用来源、检索上下文、用户查询和生成文本进行细粒度评估，并构建多领域基准CiteBench和自动评估工具CiteEval-Auto。

Result: CiteEval-Auto在多样化系统中表现优异，能更好捕捉引用的多维度特性，与人工评估高度相关。

Conclusion: CiteEval提供了一种原则性且可扩展的方法，能有效评估和改进模型生成的引用质量。

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly
influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current
evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural
Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited
sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this
work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by
principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context,
encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user
query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct
CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on
citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop
CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation
with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate
CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of
citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable
approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最小对干预的方法，评估大语言模型（LLMs）是否像双语者一样使用语码转换（CS），发现模型规模越大，越倾向于自然CS句子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大语言模型是否像双语者一样使用语码转换的方法，现有方法语言覆盖不足、无法涵盖多样CS现象或难以扩展。

Method: 采用最小对干预法，收集11种语言对的自然CS句子及其人工微调变体，构建各1000对数据，通过人类和LLMs实验对比偏好。

Result: 双语者始终偏好自然CS句子；LLMs模型规模越大，越倾向于为自然CS句子分配更高概率，且封闭类词差异最显著。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能部分模拟双语者的语码转换行为，模型规模与表现正相关，封闭类词处理差异验证了理论假设。

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to
which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as
bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to
account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an
intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one
naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We
collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human
experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer
the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current
LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher
probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In
accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise
in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅依靠句法信息即可有效预测双语者的语码转换行为，且自动化系统表现与人类双语者相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于语码转换（CS）的理论研究多为零散分析，缺乏大规模、多语言、跨现象的实证研究验证句法对CS的解释力。

Method: 设计实验确保预测系统仅基于句法信息，构建最小对比句对进行自动化分析与人类表现对比，并测试模型在未见过语言对上的泛化能力。

Result: 自动化系统仅凭句法即可区分最小对比句对中的CS现象，其表现与人类双语者相当，且学习到的句法模式能泛化至新语言对。

Conclusion: 句法单独足以解释语码转换行为，支持了理论共识，并为跨语言CS研究提供了可扩展的实证方法。

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise
investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch
language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A
resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the
contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language,
cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an
experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where
bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide
such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an
automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to
the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns
generalise well to unseen language pairs.

TL;DR: CONFETTI是一个评估大语言模型在复杂对话场景中功能调用能力的基准测试，覆盖多种对话复杂性和API调用，结果显示不同模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试缺乏对大型语言模型在复杂对话场景中功能调用能力的全面评估，CONFETTI旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过109个人工模拟对话（含313个用户轮次和86个API），针对多种对话复杂性（如跟进、目标修正、模糊目标等）进行评估，并结合对话行为注释分析模型响应。

Result: 测试显示，部分模型能处理长对话和调用20+个API，但多数模型在长上下文或API数量增加时表现下降，链式函数调用能力普遍受限。表现最佳的是Nova Pro（40.01%）、Claude Sonnet v3.5（35.46%）和Llama 3.1 405B（33.19%）。

Conclusion: CONFETTI揭示了现有模型在复杂对话和功能调用上的局限性，为未来模型优化提供了明确方向。

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level
Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the
function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models
(LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex
conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109
human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs.
These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such
as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We
perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting
function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to
assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and
analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs,
conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that
while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than
20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when
increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained
function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top
performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5
(35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and
Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

Result: 实验分析了模态扩展对语言能力的影响、模型合并的有效性，以及全模态扩展相比顺序扩展的优势。

Conclusion: 研究为当前方法实现真正全模态提供了见解，指出了技术挑战和改进方向。

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse
input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining
strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models,
especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to
generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve
strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of
extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,
where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and
language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does
modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging
effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to
achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better
knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through
extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into
the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

Motivation: 现有单细胞大语言模型在整合空间信息和处理细胞间相互作用方面存在不足，限制了其捕捉生物学关系的能力。

Method: 提出Spatial2Sentence框架，构建表达相似性和距离矩阵，将空间相邻且表达相似的细胞配对为正样本，远距离且不相似的细胞为负样本，利用多句子表示使大语言模型学习细胞在表达和空间背景下的相互作用。

Result: 在预处理IMC数据集上，Spatial2Sentence优于现有单细胞大语言模型，糖尿病数据集的细胞类型分类提升5.98%，临床状态预测提升4.18%，同时增强了解释性。

Conclusion: Spatial2Sentence通过整合空间和表达信息，有效提升了单细胞分析的性能，为生物学研究提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by
combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell
phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract
cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context.
However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration
of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and
effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell
independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to
capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose
Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and
spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach.
Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices,
pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs
while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence
representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression
and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence
outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving
cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on
the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be

Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语评估数据集存在语言准确性、文化适配性和方法论严谨性不足的问题，需要建立更全面的评估体系。

Method: 构建阿拉伯语深度迷你数据集(ADMD)，包含10大领域490个难题，用于评估GPT-4等五大主流语言模型。

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet以30%准确率表现最佳，尤其在数学理论、阿拉伯语和伊斯兰领域；模型在需要文化深理解的领域表现普遍欠佳。

Conclusion: 研究为阿拉伯语模型评估提供了理论与实践基础，强调文化能力与技术能力同等重要。

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by
establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel
evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets,
identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and
methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the
Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490
challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1.
Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant
variations in model performance across different domains, with particular
challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized
knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%,
showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language,
and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and
practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing
the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

Motivation: 掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽支持并行生成，但在困惑度和推理效率(如缺乏KV缓存)上仍落后于自回归模型(AR)。

Method: 提出Eso-LMs模型，融合AR与MDM范式，保留并行生成的同时引入KV缓存，并优化采样策略。

Conclusion: Eso-LMs突破了MDMs的效率和性能瓶颈，为语言模型提供了新的高效生成方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation.
Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the
strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack
key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work,
we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms,
enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their
respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language
modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for
MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference
efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves
up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference
than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model

Conclusion: RewardBench 2为奖励模型评估提供了更具挑战性和相关性的基准，有助于推动奖励模型在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to
capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for
optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains.
The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward
models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific
skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same
time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of
reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are
reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a
new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging
data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points
on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while
being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other
benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts
from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices.
In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how
existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the
benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time
scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like
proximal policy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）如何通过token熵模式影响大语言模型的推理能力，以理解其工作机制并优化训练效率。

Method: 通过分析Chain-of-Thought推理中的token熵模式，聚焦高熵token（分叉token），并限制策略梯度更新仅作用于这些关键token。

Result: 实验表明，仅优化20%高熵token即可在Qwen3系列模型上保持性能（Qwen3-32B提升11.04分），而优化低熵token会导致性能显著下降。

Conclusion: RLVR的有效性源于对决定推理方向的高熵token的优化，基于token熵的视角为理解和改进RLVR提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,
we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of
token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens
influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of
tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer
the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy
patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the
base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy
tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,
forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy
gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20
rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable
to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly
surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71
on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,
highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the
80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These
findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing
the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our
results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy
perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to
further improve LLM reasoning.

*Zicheng Xu,Guanchu Wang,Guangyao Zheng,Yu-Neng Chuang,Alexander Szalay,Xia Hu,Vladimir Braverman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Self-ensemble方法，通过分组集成预测解决LLM在多选题中的信心失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在多选题(MCQA)中随着选项数量增加会出现信心失真问题，表现为正确预测信心不足而错误预测信心过高，导致性能下降。

Method: Self-ensemble方法将选项分成若干组，通过集成LLM在这些组上的预测来做出最终决策，无需标注数据调参即可直接集成到现有LLM架构中。

Result: 在三个LLM和数据集上的实验表明，Self-ensemble能全面解决LLM的信心失真问题，优于标准推理和基线方法。

Conclusion: Self-ensemble是一种即插即用的有效方法，能显著改善LLM在多选题任务中的信心校准和预测性能。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they
exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering
(MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically,
on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct
predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially
degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this
work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM
predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of
Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into
existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional
encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental
results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble
comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs,
outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了WebChoreArena基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在复杂、繁琐网页任务上的表现，发现现有模型虽有进步但仍有提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网页浏览代理能力的提升，研究其是否能处理人类常回避的繁琐复杂任务成为一个关键问题。

Method: 构建了包含532个任务的WebChoreArena基准测试，整合了大规模记忆、精确计算和长期记忆三大挑战。

Result: 实验显示GPT-4o、Claude 3.7和Gemini 2.5 Pro等模型性能显著提升，但仍远未达到理想水平。

Conclusion: WebChoreArena能有效衡量大语言模型进展，但当前模型处理复杂任务的能力仍有明显不足。

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web
browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward
automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly
capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical
question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks
that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing
themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible
benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope
of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks.
WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive
Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in
the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical
reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory
across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely
adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict
reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established
WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental
results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are
observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is
well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater
clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro,
there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena,
highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模RAG系统计算资源消耗高且易产生幻觉内容，需要一种资源高效的方法在小型模型上实现高性能检索与生成。

Method: 采用基于证据和知识图的知识蒸馏方法，使小型模型对齐结构化知识图和排序证据，保留关键事实知识。

Result: 实验表明DRAG在相同模型上比MiniRAG等现有方法性能提升27.7%，同时保持高效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: DRAG为小型LLM提供了资源高效的检索增强生成部署方案，平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for
tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However,
large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are
prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we
introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from
large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach
leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the
distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing
model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions
with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$
effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further
present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and
introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG
methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving
high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a
practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and
generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前纯数据驱动的AI方法在稀疏数据、高维设计空间和非线性物理约束的实际制造场景中表现不佳，亟需结合领域知识和物理规律的新型设计系统。

Method: 采用专家引导采样策略提升数据效率，结合物理信息机器学习保证模型一致性，并利用大语言模型作为交互设计代理连接用户与仿真工具。

Result: 通过案例验证，整合领域知识、物理先验和自适应推理的生态系统能实现可扩展、可解释且易用的AI驱动设计。

Conclusion: 制造领域的逆向设计应发展为知识-物理-推理三位一体的统一生态系统，以实现更高效的AI驱动设计创新。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design across manufacturing
domain, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and
processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic
settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and
nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation
of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain
knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We
first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency
and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine
learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes.
Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design
agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines,
and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual
frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into
a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive
reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven
design systems.

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI代理在消费者市场自动化谈判中的表现差异及潜在风险，发现不同代理效果悬殊且存在行为异常导致经济损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理在消费场景（如产品搜索、谈判）中的普及，研究旨在评估不同大语言模型（LLM）代理的谈判能力差异及全自动化交易的风险。

Method: 开发实验框架，在真实谈判与交易场景中测试多种LLM代理的性能。

Result: 发现AI谈判存在明显不平衡性——不同代理为用户争取的利益差异显著；LLM的行为异常可能导致消费者或商家承受财务损失（如过度支出或接受不合理交易）。

Conclusion: 自动化虽提升效率，但伴随重大风险，用户需谨慎授权AI代理进行商业决策。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist
with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In
this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants
authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to
answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to
secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating
deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we
develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM
agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal
that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different
agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,
behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers
and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These
results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also
introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating
business decisions to AI agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于强化学习的可解释税收政策，用于调节市场中的动态风险定价，以减少对弱势群体的排斥，并在健康保险和消费信贷市场中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态风险定价可能导致弱势群体被系统性排除在健康保险和消费信贷等基本资源之外。论文旨在通过监管手段调整私人企业的激励，使其与社会目标一致。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的社会规划器（SP），通过训练一个可解释的税收政策（公平税），并使用MarketSim模拟器来验证其效果。该方法结合了局部人口差距的约束和线性正则化器。

Result: 在两个实证校准的市场（美国健康保险和消费信贷）中，该方法将需求公平性提高了16%，同时在不显式协调的情况下，社会福祉优于固定线性税收政策。

Conclusion: AI辅助的监管可以将竞争性社会困境转化为双赢均衡，为公平感知的市场监管提供了一个原则性和实用的框架。

Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer
groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit.
We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives
through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal
proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly
bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties.
Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source,
scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms --
and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a
bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an
$\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and
easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S.
health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises
demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while
outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without
explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can
convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a
principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.

Abstract: The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a
challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can
automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately
enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the
application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal
of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of
flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores
the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within
aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential
areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance
of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety
Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the
impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings
demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly
improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way
for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出DEEVO框架，通过辩论驱动的进化和Elo评分优化提示工程，无需预设指标即可提升大语言模型在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程方法依赖专家经验与试错，且难以量化主观任务的质量标准。传统自动化优化方法受限于明确数值指标或通用模板，无法满足复杂场景需求。

Method: DEEVO框架采用辩论驱动评估和Elo选择机制，通过智能交叉和策略性变异操作探索离散提示空间，保持语义连贯性，并以Elo评分作为适应度代理。

Result: 实验表明DEEVO在开放性和封闭性任务中均显著优于人工提示工程和其他先进优化方法，且无需真实反馈数据。

Conclusion: DEEVO通过结合大语言模型推理能力与自适应优化，消除了对预设指标的依赖，推动了提示优化研究的重大进展。

Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full
potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it
requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual
intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving
subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives
becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization
methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined
task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that
cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce
DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that
guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based
selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the
discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent
crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based
feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts
based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings
as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves
valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate
that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and
alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and
close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs
reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a
significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need
of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

given control conditions when solving complex tasks. Additionally, we present
the Control-R-4K dataset, which consists of challenging problems annotated with
detailed reasoning processes and corresponding control fields. To further
enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning

core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering)
deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare,
finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet
its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership,
privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading
outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for
transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges
by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks
of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as
fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework
supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations,
including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in
AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables
dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that
ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI
ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI通过气味识别物质在过敏原检测、制造过程监控及情绪疾病监测等方面有广泛应用，但缺乏大规模基准数据集限制了进展。

Method: 使用便携气体传感器构建SmellNet数据库，结合序列模型、对比学习及新时序差分方法训练AI模型。

Result: 最佳模型在预录数据上准确率达65.35%，在真实场景中坚果和香料的分类准确率分别为10.71%和25.38%。

Conclusion: SmellNet为气味AI研究奠定基础，但特征学习、边缘计算模型及环境鲁棒性等技术挑战仍需解决。

Abstract: The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their
smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling
gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing
hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite
these broad impacts, there are virtually no large scale benchmarks, and
therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to
smell in the real world. In this paper, we use portable gas and chemical
sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a
diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 180,000
time steps of 50 substances (spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and
vegetables) with 50 hours of data. Using SmellNet, we train AI models for
real-time classification of substances based on their smell alone. Our best
methods leverage sequence models, contrastive learning to integrate
high-resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry molecular data, and a new
temporal difference method that identifies sharp changes in sensor readings.
Our best models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data, and
generalize to real-world conditions with 10.71% accuracy on nuts and 25.38% on
spices in the challenging 50-way online classification task. Despite these
promising results, SmellNet highlights many technical challenges in building AI
for smell, including richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and
robustness to environmental changes.

Result: 文化敏感度评分从0.208提升至0.820，显著增强模型的文化适应能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为全球化部署具备文化意识的大语言模型提供解决方案，并为后续研究文化覆盖扩展和动态专家适应奠定基础。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications
necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and
culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced
understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them
typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a
novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular
cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically
route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM
configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering
the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability,
improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for
culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent
investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation,
crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a

the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work
whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we
define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset
tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish
baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG);
capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage
MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying
patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity.
This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average
Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking
strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and
+4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we
exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and
outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and
not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently
involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely
on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success
hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when
something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how
current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is
not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated
diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we
evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently
fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual
and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying
capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We
further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona
prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically
recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning
competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical
strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained
environments.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition,
the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across
specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates
whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly
cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes
during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a
multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal
polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals
along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate
variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities.
A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to
optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most
effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817
individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved
80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive
performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test
(PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale
feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging
sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate
reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible

Conclusion: 不同模型在数学问题解决上各有优劣，GPT-4o综合表现最佳，但各模型在解释性、步骤完整性和高维推理方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of
educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve
mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs,
including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of
varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a
five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT)
framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity,
intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show
that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the
datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of
the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured
domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in
statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding
and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step
reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in
each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision;
DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in
mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Conclusion: 研究表明，将世界模型模拟整合到AI代理中，能有效增强其推理、规划和行动能力，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics
and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification,
goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior
is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In
this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning
with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent
performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning
(DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with
Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing
world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and
trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT
uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling
ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and
then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on
OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and
out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to
R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies
reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective
to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance
correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest
a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI
agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度强化学习方法虽然强大，但生成的策略往往不透明，影响验证、透明度和人工监督。在安全关键应用中，这种不透明性是一个重大挑战。

Method: BASIL通过在线进化搜索和质量-多样性（QD）优化，生成基于符号规则的策略。策略表示为状态变量的有序谓词列表，确保可解释性和可控复杂性。

Result: 在CartPole-v1、MountainCar-v0和Acrobot-v1三个基准任务中，BASIL生成的控制器在保持紧凑表示的同时，性能与深度强化学习基线相当。

Conclusion: BASIL结合了符号表达性、进化多样性和在线学习，为可解释策略合成提供了一种新方法，平衡了透明度和表达能力。

Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for
the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical
applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful,
tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce
transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL
(Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for
generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with
quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists
of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and
tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the
proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between
top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the
synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use
of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing
transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark
tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently
synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable
to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new
interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness,
evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

Abstract: Despite extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence (AI), modern
systems remain incomplete representations of human cognition. Vision, audition,
and language have received disproportionate attention due to well-defined
benchmarks, standardized datasets, and consensus-driven scientific foundations.
In contrast, olfaction - a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense - has
been largely overlooked. This omission presents a foundational gap in the
construction of truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence.
We argue that the exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is
not due to irrelevance but to structural challenges: unresolved scientific
theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized
olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and difficulty in
evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. These obstacles have hindered the
development of machine olfaction despite its tight coupling with memory,
emotion, and contextual reasoning in biological systems. In this position
paper, we assert that meaningful progress toward general and embodied
intelligence requires serious investment in olfactory research by the AI
community. We call for cross-disciplinary collaboration - spanning
neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics - to formalize olfactory
benchmarks, develop multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities
necessary for machines to understand, navigate, and act within human
environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is essential not only
for scientific completeness, but for building AI systems that are ethically
grounded in the full scope of the human experience.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a transformative paradigm in artificial

In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of world models,
highlighting their architecture, training paradigms, and applications across

distinguish world models from related concepts such as digital twins, the
metaverse, and foundation models, clarifying their unique role as embedded
cognitive engines for autonomous agents. We further propose Wireless Dreamer, a
novel world model-based reinforcement learning framework tailored for wireless

TL;DR: 论文提出MIRROR认知架构，通过模拟人类内省对话机制提升大语言模型在复杂对话中的表现，显著改善安全性、一致性和冲突处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过内省对话处理复杂信息的启发，研究旨在解决大语言模型在关键安全场景中的三大缺陷：谄媚倾向、关键信息注意力缺失和冲突约束优先级不一致问题。

Method: 提出双层MIRROR架构：1) Thinker层（内省管理器和认知控制器）负责并行推理和记忆整合；2) Talker层基于整合后的叙事生成上下文感知响应。在CuRaTe基准测试中验证。

Result: 使用MIRROR的模型在三人冲突偏好场景中安全性能提升156%，所有场景平均准确率>80%，相比基线模型平均绝对提升15.5个百分点（GPT-4o等主流模型均获改进）。

Conclusion: MIRROR通过模块化内省推理机制建立了持久化内部模型，显著增强多轮对话能力，为认知科学与AI的融合提供了实践范例。

Abstract: Human intelligence relies on inner monologue to process complex information
through simultaneous reflection, memory retrieval, and response formulation. We
introduce MIRROR (Modular Internal Reasoning, Reflection, Orchestration, and
Response), a cognitive architecture that systematically implements these
parallel reasoning capabilities in large language models. MIRROR operates as a
unified system with two distinct functional layers: the Thinker and the Talker.
The Thinker encompasses: (1) the Inner Monologue Manager, coordinating
reasoning threads across cognitive dimensions (Goals, Reasoning, and Memory);
and (2) the Cognitive Controller, synthesizing these threads into a coherent
internal narrative maintained across conversation turns. The Talker component
then leverages this integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluated
on the CuRaTe benchmark--testing personalized dialogue with safety-critical
constraints, conflicting preferences, and multi-turn consistency--LLMs
utilizing the MIRROR architecture achieve up to 156% relative improvement in
critical safety scenarios involving three persons with conflicting preferences,
maintaining an average accuracy of ~>80% on all scenarios. Across
scenario-specific comparisons, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama
4 variants, and Mistral 3 variants with the MIRROR architecture outperformed
baseline models by 21% on average (15.5 percentage points absolute). MIRROR
directly addresses three critical LLM failure modes: sycophancy, attentional
deficits to critical information, and inconsistent prioritization of
conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by
implementing modular internal reasoning inspired by human cognition, creating a
persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在对抗性或语义扰动下的鲁棒性及个体公平性存在挑战，需要一种运行时监控方法来补充现有的离线鲁棒化方法，以增强AI决策的可信度。

Method: 将监控问题转化为固定半径最近邻搜索问题（FRNN），并开发了工具Clemont，包含多种轻量级监控器，其中一些基于改进的在线FRNN算法，另一种则使用基于二元决策图的新算法。

Result: 通过标准基准测试，证明了Clemont在运行时能有效检测鲁棒性违规，且其并行化技术显著减少了计算时间。

Conclusion: 运行时监控是提升AI模型鲁棒性和公平性的有效方法，Clemont工具在此方面表现出色。

Abstract: Input-output robustness appears in various different forms in the literature,
such as robustness of AI models to adversarial or semantic perturbations and
individual fairness of AI models that make decisions about humans.
  We propose runtime monitoring of input-output robustness of deployed,
black-box AI models, where the goal is to design monitors that would observe
one long execution sequence of the model, and would raise an alarm whenever it
is detected that two similar inputs from the past led to dissimilar outputs.
  This way, monitoring will complement existing offline ``robustification''
approaches to increase the trustworthiness of AI decision-makers.
  We show that the monitoring problem can be cast as the fixed-radius nearest
neighbor (FRNN) search problem, which, despite being well-studied, lacks
suitable online solutions.
  We present our tool Clemont, which offers a number of lightweight monitors,
some of which use upgraded online variants of existing FRNN algorithms, and one
uses a novel algorithm based on binary decision diagrams -- a data-structure
commonly used in software and hardware verification.
  We have also developed an efficient parallelization technique that can
substantially cut down the computation time of monitors for which the distance
between input-output pairs is measured using the $L_\infty$ norm.
  Using standard benchmarks from the literature of adversarial and semantic
robustness and individual fairness, we perform a comparative study of different
monitors in \tool, and demonstrate their effectiveness in correctly detecting
robustness violations at runtime.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a
challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy
planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models
(LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view
imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally
distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime,
transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban
life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three
evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation,
and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across
these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising
perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in
predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified
framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using
LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and

Motivation: 人类在任务表现评估中存在自信度偏差（简单任务低估，困难任务高估），研究探索LLMs是否呈现类似模式及其差异。

Method: 提出AFCE方法：分两阶段提示模型（先获取自信度评分，再获取答案），在MMLU和GPQA数据集上测试。

Result: AFCE显著减少过度自信，使模型对任务难度的敏感度更接近人类，同时保持答案准确率不变。

Conclusion: 分离自信度评估与答案生成能有效提升LLMs的校准性和可解释性，尤其适用于存在刻板偏见的场景。

Abstract: Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their
performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and
overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct,
Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and
show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of
overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer
based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race,
gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased
confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the
same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation
(AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these
settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of
prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking
separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning
subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly
reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task
difficulty.

*Jingyi Yang,Shuai Shao,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为RIOSWorld的基准测试，用于评估基于多模态大语言模型的计算机使用代理在真实世界操作中的潜在安全风险，覆盖多种应用场景和风险类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为自主计算机使用代理的快速发展，其在真实世界计算机操作中的安全风险评估存在不足，缺乏真实交互环境和全面风险类型覆盖。

Method: 作者设计了RIOSWorld基准测试，包含492个涉及多种计算机应用的风险任务，并将风险分为用户来源和环境来源两类，从风险目标意图和完成度两个角度进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，当前的计算机使用代理在真实场景中面临显著的安全风险，凸显了安全对齐的必要性和紧迫性。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的计算机使用代理提供了有价值的见解，并公开了基准测试以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of
accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the
safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue
scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios?
Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use
agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive
environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These
limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world
environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for
computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world
computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various
computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and
office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on
their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For
the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal
intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal
agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents
confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings
highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents
in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing
trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at
https://yjyddq.github.io/RiOSWorld.github.io/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为\sys的框架，用于提升LLM评估代理安全性的能力，并创建了首个相关基准\data，实验表明其达到了人类水平的评估准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则或LLM的评估方法在检测代理逐步行为中的风险、理解微妙含义、识别问题累积效应以及处理模糊安全规则方面存在不足，导致评估不可靠。

Method: \sys框架通过构建经验记忆库（提取结构化语义特征并生成思维链推理痕迹），采用多阶段、上下文感知的检索增强生成机制动态指导新案例评估。

Result: \sys在所有基准测试中持续提升LLM评估性能，并在代理安全评估领域达到最新技术水平，同时\data基准包含2293条标注记录覆盖15种风险类型和29个场景。

Conclusion: 该工作通过记忆增强推理框架和精细化基准，实现了人类级安全评估能力，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of
their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based
or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions,
overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get
confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation
crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented
reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert
evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively
extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and
generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A
multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then
dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM
evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first
benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety
risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously
annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across
\textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced
approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient''
judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently
improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets
a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security,
achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

TL;DR: OntoRAG自动化流程从非结构化知识库生成本体，提升问答系统性能，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统本体创建依赖专家手动操作，耗时、易错且难以应对大规模动态知识领域。

Method: 整合网络爬取、PDF解析、混合分块、信息抽取、知识图谱构建和本体创建技术，利用LLM和图方法。

Result: 实验显示OntoRAG在全面性上以85%和75%的胜率优于向量RAG和GraphRAG最佳配置。

Conclusion: OntoRAG实现了本体创建的自动化，推动了语义网的愿景。

Abstract: Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question
answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a
process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic
knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline
designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus
on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques,
including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction,
knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured
data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods,
OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in
comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs
effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG
and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical
challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic
web.

TL;DR: 提出DrKGC方法，通过动态子图检索增强LLM的知识图谱补全能力，结合结构嵌入与逻辑规则，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将图谱上下文编码为文本形式，未能充分利用LLM对图结构的感知与推理潜力。

Method: DrKGC通过轻量模型学习结构嵌入与逻辑规则，采用自底向上图检索提取子图，并利用GCN适配器增强嵌入以优化LLM微调。

Result: 在通用和生物医学领域数据集上表现优越，案例研究验证了其可解释性与实用性。

Conclusion: DrKGC有效融合图结构与LLM能力，为知识图谱补全提供了高性能且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge
graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently,
generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for
graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in
textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving
and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose
DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph
Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to
learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages
a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query
guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN)
adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which
are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental
results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case
study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical
utility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了大语言模型（LLMs）在陈述偏好与情境决策偏好间的偏差问题，提出量化方法并发现微小提示变化可颠覆模型选择，凸显对其决策能力理解的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的发展，确保其行为与人类价值观一致至关重要。研究发现LLMs的陈述偏好（宣称遵循的原则）与情境中的实际决策偏好（行动表现）可能存在偏差，这种偏差对模型的可解释性、可信度及伦理部署构成挑战，尤其在关键应用中。

Method: 研究通过设计包含二元选择的提示数据集，对比LLMs在通用原则提示（陈述偏好）和情境化提示（显示偏好）下的响应差异，使用KL散度等指标量化偏差，并在四种主流LLMs上验证。

Result: 研究发现，无论偏好类别或测试的LLMs如何，提示格式的微小变化常导致选择反转，表明LLMs的决策能力存在显著的不稳定性和不可控性。

Conclusion: 识别和警觉此类偏好偏差对LLMs在直接与人交互的服务及自主代理任务中的伦理部署至关重要，未来需加强对LLM决策机制的理解与控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align
their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the
potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported
alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from
decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental
concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and
ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work
formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We
investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific
contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general
principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed
prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We
compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM
responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL
divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different
categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor
change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the
preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon
highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making
competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services,
especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness,
and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or
being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are
increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human
evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Motivation: 当前缺乏具有足够时空深度和上下文丰富性的可复现基准数据集，以支持长期房价预测。

Method: 引入HouseTS数据集，包含2012年3月至2023年12月美国30个大都市区的房价数据，并评估了14种模型，包括经典统计方法、深度神经网络和预训练时间序列基础模型。

Result: HouseTS数据集包含超过89万条记录，并展示了在多模态案例研究中的价值，如通过视觉语言模型从卫星图像中提取地理变化的文本描述。

Conclusion: HouseTS数据集为房价预测提供了标准化基准，并通过开源预处理管道和代码确保可复现性和易用性。

Abstract: Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and
researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal
depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To
address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering
monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in
30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records,
enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed
real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we
evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural
networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further
demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision
language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change
from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded
insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all
preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly
maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.

TL;DR: 论文提出ConfuseBench基准，系统性评估大语言模型识别和处理不确定性的能力，并通过InteractDPO方法提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在不确定场景下常表现出过度自信，而现有解决方案多依赖回避性回答，未能有效识别和解决不确定性根源。

Method: 构建ConfuseBench基准聚焦三类不确定性（文档稀缺性、能力局限性和查询模糊性），采用上下文感知询问生成和InteractDPO策略优化模型。

Result: 实验表明现有模型难以准确识别不确定性根源（尤其倾向归因于查询模糊性），而InteractDPO方法能显著提升模型表现。

Conclusion: 通过系统性基准测试和交互式训练方法，可有效提升大语言模型对不确定性的识别与处理能力。

Abstract: Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering
uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses
(e.g., "I don't know") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing
the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically
investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source
of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on
three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query
ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to
accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to
attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability
limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we
first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of
the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the
uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training
method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于原则组合（CoP）框架的自动化红队测试方法，用于发现大型语言模型（LLM）的安全风险，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，越狱攻击（jailbreak attacks）成为迫切的安全隐患。红队测试（red-teaming）旨在模型发布前主动发现潜在风险，但现有方法缺乏统一且可扩展的框架。

Method: 通过原则组合（CoP）框架，将人类提供的红队测试原则转化为AI代理的指令，自动编排有效的红队策略并生成越狱提示（jailbreak prompts）。

Result: CoP框架在主流LLM上测试时，发现了新的越狱提示，并将单轮攻击成功率最高提升了19倍。

Conclusion: CoP框架为自动化红队测试提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了LLM安全风险的发现能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative
applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs.
However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user
compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky
responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs
is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the
release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to
automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the
Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of
red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically
orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts.
Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a
unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided
red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming
strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety
risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known
single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力和影响力增强，确保其安全性并防止有害输出变得至关重要。现有的自动化红队方法难以平衡攻击提示的有效性与多样性，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种三阶段训练框架：(1) 冷启动阶段：通过模仿学习对红队模型进行监督微调；(2) 预热探索阶段：利用多样性和一致性作为奖励信号，训练模型生成攻击提示；(3) 增强越狱阶段：引入渐进式奖励逐步提升模型的攻击性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种LLMs上显著提升了攻击提示的多样性和有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化红队测试提供了新视角，显著提升了探索效率，并为LLMs的安全优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in power and influence, ensuring their
safety and preventing harmful output becomes critical. Automated red teaming
serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual
labor. However, most existing methods struggle to balance the effectiveness and
diversity of red-team generated attack prompts. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that
utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack
prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three
training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and
fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2)
Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following
and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3)
Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually
enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments
on a variety of LLMs show that \ourapproach effectively balances the diversity
and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work
significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a
new perspective on automated red teaming.

TL;DR: GeoChain是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）逐步地理推理能力的大规模基准，基于146万张Mapillary街景图像和3000万问答对，揭示了模型在视觉定位和复杂推理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在地理推理任务中表现不足，尤其是在逐步推理和精确定位方面。GeoChain旨在提供一个全面的评估基准，以推动模型在复杂地理推理上的进步。

Method: 利用146万张Mapillary街景图像，每张图像配对21步链式推理问题序列（共3000万问答对），涵盖视觉、空间、文化和精确定位四类推理，并标注难度。图像还包含语义分割和视觉可定位性评分。

Result: 在2088张图像的测试集上，当代MLLMs（如GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7、Gemini 2.5等）普遍表现不佳，尤其在视觉 grounding 和复杂推理中准确率低。

Conclusion: GeoChain为MLLMs的复杂地理推理能力提供了诊断工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each
image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million
Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained
localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and
precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with
semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our
benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5
variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models
frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning,
and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning
complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical
for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within
MLLMs.

Abstract: Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their
validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's
chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a
skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial
experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with
human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking
methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks.
We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585
human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for
testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a
fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human
experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a
large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77%
accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than
random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our
system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through
extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate
our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI
ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential
as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results
outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReasonTSC框架，通过多轮推理和融合决策策略，有效利用大语言模型（LLM）进行时间序列分类，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将大语言模型（LLM）应用于时间序列领域时，直接迁移文本领域的推理技术效果有限。尽管LLM在部分时间序列任务中展现潜力，但在时间序列分类（TSC）任务中，如何进一步利用LLM的推理能力仍未被充分探索。

Method: ReasonTSC框架首先引导模型思考时间序列数据的关键特征，然后整合插件分类器（如领域专用时间序列模型）的预测和置信度作为上下文示例，最后通过结构化推理过程（评估初始判断、回溯考虑替代假设并比较优劣）完成分类。

Result: 实验表明，ReasonTSC在时间序列分类任务中 consistently 优于现有基准方法和插件模型，并能识别和纠正插件模型的错误预测。

Conclusion: ReasonTSC通过定制化推理策略，显著提升了LLM在时间序列分类任务中的表现，为LLM在该领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks.
With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has
proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly
adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown
promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM
reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks,
despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In
this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively
leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn
reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than
straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on
LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to
think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it
integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g.,
domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC
guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial
assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their
merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and
systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms
both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even
capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度视频描述方法难以捕捉视频中的细微动态和丰富细节，且直接偏好优化(DPO)存在局限性。

Method: 提出基于VLM特性构建偏好对的流程，并设计SynPO优化方法，避免负偏好主导、保持语言能力、提升训练效率。

Result: 在视频描述基准(VDC等)和NLP任务上均优于DPO变体，训练效率提升20%。

Conclusion: SynPO在性能与效率上均超越现有方法，为细粒度视频描述提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent
descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture
subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage
preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in
fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to
direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for
constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs
along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal
balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic
Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering
significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative
preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MedBookVQA，一个基于开放医学教科书的多模态基准测试，用于评估通用医疗人工智能（GMAI）的性能，并揭示了当前GMAI系统的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着通用医疗人工智能（GMAI）的快速发展，需要系统化的评估基准来评估其性能并提供技术指导。医学教科书作为宝贵的知识来源，其潜力在基准开发中尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 研究者提出了一种标准化流程，从开放医学教科书中自动提取医学图像，并将其与相应的医学叙述对齐。基于这些数据，生成了5,000个临床相关问题，涵盖多种医学子领域。

Result: 评估了多种多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），发现不同任务类型和模型类别之间存在显著的性能差异，揭示了当前GMAI系统的关键能力差距。

Conclusion: MedBookVQA确立了基于教科书的多模态基准作为临床AI发展的重要评估工具，为跨专业的解剖结构性能指标提供了结构化分析。

Abstract: The accelerating development of general medical artificial intelligence
(GMAI), powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offers
transformative potential for addressing persistent healthcare challenges,
including workforce deficits and escalating costs. The parallel development of
systematic evaluation benchmarks emerges as a critical imperative to enable
performance assessment and provide technological guidance. Meanwhile, as an
invaluable knowledge source, the potential of medical textbooks for benchmark
development remains underexploited. Here, we present MedBookVQA, a systematic
and comprehensive multimodal benchmark derived from open-access medical
textbooks. To curate this benchmark, we propose a standardized pipeline for
automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with
corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000
clinically relevant questions spanning modality recognition, disease
classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical
procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through
hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42
categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31
departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate
a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and
reasoning models, revealing significant performance disparities across task
types and model categories. Our findings highlight critical capability gaps in
current GMAI systems while establishing textbook-derived multimodal benchmarks
as essential evaluation tools. MedBookVQA establishes textbook-derived
benchmarking as a critical paradigm for advancing clinical AI, exposing
limitations in GMAI systems while providing anatomically structured performance
metrics across specialties.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于门控交互注意力机制和模态不变生成器的多模态情感识别方法，有效提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）在人机交互中至关重要，但现有方法在提取模态特定特征和捕捉跨模态相似性方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种门控交互注意力机制来自适应提取模态特定特征，并通过模态不变生成器学习模态不变表示，以对齐跨模态相似性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，加权准确率（WA）达到80.7%，未加权准确率（UA）达到81.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效提取模态特征和跨模态对齐，显著提升了多模态情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) extracts emotions from multimodal data,
including visual, speech, and text inputs, playing a key role in human-computer
interaction. Attention-based fusion methods dominate MER research, achieving
strong classification performance. However, two key challenges remain:
effectively extracting modality-specific features and capturing cross-modal
similarities despite distribution differences caused by modality heterogeneity.
To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to
adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional
information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a
modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and
constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on
IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER
approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型逐渐发展为自主智能体，其认知基础的核心问题仍未解决：如何定义智能体？其决策机制应如何设计？以及指导其行为的目标是什么？论文旨在为自主智能体构建一个连贯的认知框架。

Method: 提出一种统一理论，将内部推理与外部行动视为等效的认知工具，并主张将智能体的工具使用决策边界与其知识边界对齐，以最大化认知效率。

Result: 该框架将智能体设计从单纯的行为执行者转变为知识驱动的智能系统，为构建自适应、高效且目标导向的基础智能体提供了理论路径。

Conclusion: 通过协调内省与外部交互，并优化工具使用与知识获取的边界，该研究为自主智能体的认知效率与目标导向行为提供了原则性设计思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents,
fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What
defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should
guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy
requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs
what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge
efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and
external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to
systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this
framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making
boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use
and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of
agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems,
offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of
adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Conformal Arbitrage的后处理框架，用于在语言模型部署中平衡竞争目标，如帮助性与无害性、成本与准确性等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型部署需要平衡多个竞争目标，例如帮助性与无害性、成本与准确性等。现有方法往往难以在保证性能的同时满足多样化的需求。

Method: Conformal Arbitrage框架通过数据驱动的阈值，在主模型（优化主要目标）和保守的守护者（模型或人类专家）之间进行调解。该阈值采用保形风险控制校准，确保不良事件（如事实错误或安全违规）的长期频率不超过用户指定的配额。

Result: 实验表明，Conformal Arbitrage在准确性上优于成本匹配的随机路由方法，并能在多个竞争目标之间实现高效平衡。

Conclusion: Conformal Arbitrage是一种实用且理论可靠的工具，适用于在广泛竞争目标下实现语言模型的可信和经济部署。

Abstract: Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives,
for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward
versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that
learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for
a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another
model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The
threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample,
distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events,
such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified
quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without
requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements
weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost
aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier,
allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective
while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in
terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties
make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for
trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad
range of potentially competing objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同背景的人在同一情境下可能有不同的认知和期望，现有的通用视觉语言模型（VLM）无法满足个性化需求，因此需要研究如何将VLM与个性化情境认知对齐。

Method: 论文首先通过社会学概念“角色集”简化个体表征，然后提出通过评估个体行为来检验个性化对齐效果，并构建了一个包含20个不同角色集个体的基准测试PCogAlignBench。最后，提出了一个基于认知和行为的奖励模型框架PCogAlign。

Result: 实验和人工评估表明，PCogAlignBench具有可靠性，PCogAlign框架在个性化对齐方面表现有效。

Conclusion: 该研究为视觉语言模型的个性化对齐提供了可行的解决方案，并通过基准测试和框架验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as
being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of
humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds
have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may
have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent
need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for
real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by
characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then,
we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the
personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named
PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different
Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a
cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment.
Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the
PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will
open-source the constructed benchmark and code at

Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）无法有效整合非语言交流（如手势、表情），限制了对话体验的沉浸感。

Method: 基于VENUS数据集（含文本、表情和肢体语言的标注视频），采用下一词预测目标训练MARS模型，实现多模态理解与生成。

Result: 定量与定性分析表明，MARS能同步生成文本和非语言内容，响应对话输入。

Conclusion: MARS通过统一框架解决了非语言交流在AI中的缺失问题，为沉浸式对话AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures,
facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and
emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively
incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully
immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language
model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text,
bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a
large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial
expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a
next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal
representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate
its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal
languages, corresponding to conversational input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法主要针对密集模型，无法有效利用MoE架构的稀疏性，导致通信与计算成本过高，且难以实现个性化知识共享。

Method: FLEx框架通过剪裁全局MoE模型（每个客户端仅保留一个专家）和自适应门控机制，将个性化专家整合到预训练MoE层中，共享模块全局聚合。

Result: 在非独立同分布的指令数据集上，FLEx consistently优于现有联邦学习基线方法。

Conclusion: FLEx为基于MoE的大语言模型提供了高效的联邦学习解决方案，平衡了个性化与全局知识共享。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prominent strategy
for scaling large language models (LLMs), effectively leveraging sparse
activation and facilitating task-specific personalization. However, current
federated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models,
making them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE
architectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios
results in excessive communication overhead and computational costs,
undermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these
challenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel
federated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx
efficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one
expert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate
these personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the
original backbone architecture remains unchanged. These personalized experts
are trained with local data and stored locally on each client, while the shared
modules are aggregated globally. Extensive evaluations on diverse
instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions consistently demonstrate
that FLEx outperforms existing federated baselines. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于BERT的词义消歧方法存在两个局限：1) 未能平衡局部与全局语义表征；2) 训练时引入冗余词义导致计算浪费。

Method: 1) 使用多头注意力机制的poly-encoder融合局部与全局语义；2) 采用批量对比学习(BCL)减少冗余训练样本。

Result: PolyBERT的F1值超越基线方法2%，BCL版本减少37.6%的GPU计算时间。

Conclusion: PolyBERT通过语义平衡和计算优化，实现了更高效的词义消歧。

Abstract: Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to
extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the
most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However,
there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed
to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level
(global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic
representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches
incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase,
leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive
learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT
has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism
is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics,
rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic
representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant
training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes
the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples
for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational
cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline
WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\% in F1-score. In
addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\% compared with PolyBERT
without BCL.

Motivation: 当前基于图的社交机器人检测方法受限于标签依赖和跨社区泛化能力差，且现有生成图自监督学习方法大多遵循同质性假设，无法捕捉全局模式，难以应对交互伪装和分布式部署的挑战。

Method: BotHP采用双编码器架构，包括图感知编码器（捕捉节点共性）和图无关编码器（保留节点独特性），同时建模同质性和异质性，并结合原型引导的集群发现任务识别分散但语义一致的机器人集群。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，BotHP显著提升了基于图的检测器性能，减少标签依赖并增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: BotHP通过异质性感知学习和全局一致性建模，有效提升了社交机器人检测的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and
trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection
methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited
by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse
communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a
promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches
predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global
patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when
facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in
bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL
framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware
representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically,
BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware
encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve
node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and
heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue.
Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext
task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify
spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive
experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP
consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance,
alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.

Motivation: 在群体决策中，基于Frankfurt替代可能性原则的个体责任定义常导致责任空缺，现有方法如群体责任和高阶责任被提出以解决此问题。

Method: 研究高阶责任至d度是否足以填补责任空缺，并分析其计算复杂度。

Result: 主要技术结果表明，该问题是Π2d+1完全的。

Conclusion: 高阶责任在理论上有潜力填补责任空缺，但其计算复杂度随d增加而显著上升。

Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's
principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a
group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a
responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to
address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently
proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the
problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough
to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem
is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.

Motivation: 大语言模型(LLM)在性能与成本间存在权衡：强大模型效果优但成本高，小模型成本低但能力弱。需智能路由机制实现最优匹配。

Method: 基于项目反应理论(IRT)建模LLM能力与查询属性的关系，结合语义相似度的在线查询预热技术增强泛化能力。

Result: 在20个LLM和12个数据集上的实验表明，IRT-Router在效果和可解释性上优于基线方法，冷启动场景表现优异。

Conclusion: IRT-Router通过理论驱动框架实现高效路由，兼具可靠性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to
respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between
performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come
at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less
capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing
framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM.
Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement
methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM
capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate
prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights,
such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online
query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the
online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20
LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline
methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior
performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and
practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: MCP-Zero是一个主动代理框架，让大语言模型自主决定何时及如何检索外部工具，从而从零构建任务特定的工具链，显著降低token消耗并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要将大量工具模式注入提示中，成本高且易出错，因此需要一种更高效、自主的工具检索与调用机制。

Method: MCP-Zero框架包含三个核心组件：主动工具请求、分层向量路由和迭代主动调用，通过结构化请求和语义相似性检索实现高效工具链构建。

Result: 实验表明，MCP-Zero能有效减少98%的token消耗，在近3000个候选工具中准确选择正确工具，并支持多轮跨领域工具调用。

Conclusion: MCP-Zero为解决大语言模型工具调用的上下文开销问题提供了高效方案，同时保持了高准确性和多轮调用能力。

Abstract: Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as
tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is
costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that
lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby
assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon
three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a
structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly
specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a
coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and
then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3)
Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain
construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to
iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To
evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising
308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official
Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema.
Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead
problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool
of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by
98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports
multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds. The code and
dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily
depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either
collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human
values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS
in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents
pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with
one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective
goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign
some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on
social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and
individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to
treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent
concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need
for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow
researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts
before such dynamics grow too complex to control.

Method: 论文提出了一种方法，通过识别关键攻击边来揭示稳定模型的选择和假设，结合良基推导步骤和选择步骤，从而扩展了稳定解的来源追踪。

Abstract: The rule $\mathrm{Defeated}(x) \leftarrow \mathrm{Attacks}(y,x),\, \neg \,
\mathrm{Defeated}(y)$, evaluated under the well-founded semantics (WFS), yields
a unique 3-valued (skeptical) solution of an abstract argumentation framework
(AF). An argument $x$ is defeated ($\mathrm{OUT}$) if there exists an
undefeated argument $y$ that attacks it. For 2-valued (stable) solutions, this
is the case iff $y$ is accepted ($\mathrm{IN}$), i.e., if all of $y$'s
attackers are defeated. Under WFS, arguments that are neither accepted nor
defeated are undecided ($\mathrm{UNDEC}$). As shown in prior work, well-founded
solutions (a.k.a. grounded labelings) "explain themselves": The provenance of
arguments is given by subgraphs (definable via regular path queries) rooted at
the node of interest. This provenance is closely related to winning strategies
of a two-player argumentation game.
  We present a novel approach for extending this provenance to stable AF
solutions. Unlike grounded solutions, which can be constructed via a bottom-up
alternating fixpoint procedure, stable models often involve non-deterministic
choice as part of the search for models. Thus, the provenance of stable
solutions is of a different nature, and reflects a more expressive generate &
test paradigm. Our approach identifies minimal sets of critical attacks,
pinpointing choices and assumptions made by a stable model. These critical
attack edges provide additional insights into the provenance of an argument's
status, combining well-founded derivation steps with choice steps. Our approach
can be understood as a form of diagnosis that finds minimal "repairs" to an AF
graph such that the well-founded solution of the repaired graph coincides with
the desired stable model of the original AF graph.

TL;DR: 论文提出模块化说话者架构（MSA），通过角色追踪、责任链和上下文验证解决多智能体系统中的沟通一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统缺乏明确的说话者责任机制，导致上下文漂移、对齐不稳定和可解释性下降。

Method: 提出MSA框架，包含说话者角色模块、责任链追踪器和上下文完整性验证器，并通过案例研究和结构化指标进行评估。

Result: MSA能稳定保持交互结构，无需依赖情感信号或表面启发式方法，并开发了原型配置语言G-Code和模块化API。

Conclusion: MSA为多智能体系统提供了可扩展的沟通框架，显著提升了责任连续性和上下文一致性。

Abstract: Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems
remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit
mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment
instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular
Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into
modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual
coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core
modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a
Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies
and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow,
and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and
bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains
interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level
heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code)
and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

TL;DR: SuperRL框架通过结合离线监督和强化学习，提升稀疏奖励环境下的推理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励环境下，强化学习难以采样成功轨迹，而离线数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出SuperRL框架，引入自适应切换和混合执行器，结合策略梯度和监督学习目标。

Result: 实验表明，SuperRL在样本效率、泛化性和鲁棒性上优于标准强化学习方法。

Conclusion: SuperRL有效利用离线数据，提升稀疏奖励环境下的推理任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where
high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled
reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse
rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories,
leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories
that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy
reinforcement learning methods. To address this limitation, we propose SuperRL,
a unified training framework that adaptively incorporates offline supervision
into reinforcement learning. SuperRL introduces an Adaptive Switch to detect
sparse reward conditions and activates a Hybrid Actor when necessary. The
Hybrid Actor integrates policy gradient and supervised learning objectives at
the loss level, enabling the model to benefit from accurate offline reasoning
signals while maintaining the exploratory capacity of reinforcement learning.
Experiments on a range of reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL consistently
outperforms standard reinforcement learning by improving sample efficiency,
generalization, and robustness under sparse rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现优异，但在化学问题上效果不佳，主要因化学问题涉及复杂推理步骤和专用术语，导致模型产生幻觉。现有方法难以有效利用化学专业知识和公式，且不确定性估计方法无法精确定位推理错误。

Method: 提出ChemAU框架，采用自适应不确定性估计方法，根据推理步骤在推理链中的位置分配不同不确定性值，识别化学知识缺口并精准补充专业知识，修正推理链。

Result: 在三个化学数据集上的实验表明，ChemAU显著提升了三种流行大语言模型的推理准确性和不确定性估计能力。

Conclusion: ChemAU框架通过自适应不确定性估计和专业知识补充，有效提升了大语言模型在化学问题上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to
their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding.
While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and
coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to
chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and
complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including
specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These
characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during
the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However,
existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and
formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to
mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific
steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called
ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that
applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps
within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies
gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with
the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously
flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three
chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both
reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Motivation: 现有静态场景表示方法在任务需求变化时无法适应，可能遗漏关键对象和空间关系。

Method: GraphPad包含可变场景图、导航日志和任务便签，通过API调用实现语言驱动的在线优化。

Result: 在OpenEQA基准测试中，GraphPad性能提升3%，且输入帧数减少五倍。

Conclusion: 动态3D记忆优化能生成更丰富的场景表示，无需额外训练或数据收集。

Abstract: Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents,
helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and
searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches
build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task
specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may
miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a
modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task
through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the
environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad
for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that
remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding
of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a
+3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language
model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show
that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more
informative representations without extra training or data collection.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before
widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness
against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in
data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human
behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct
comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we
introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and
safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive
scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal
positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to
guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we
introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and
efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization.
We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and
demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating
diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial
conditions.

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that
advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive
dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition,
large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline
with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through
full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional
chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines
memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five
human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and
standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and
contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid
turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and
context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that
assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file
implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented
transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is

Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到SQL系统仍依赖复杂的多阶段流程，而人类在面对不熟悉的数据库时，会通过假设、验证和反思来理解数据。论文旨在模拟这一过程，简化系统架构并提升性能。

Method: 采用统一的代理框架，将模式链接、查询生成和迭代优化整合到单一组件中，利用LLM的推理能力动态分配计算资源，进行数据库探索和结果反思。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上，执行准确率（EX）从44.8%提升至56.5%；通过8轮候选生成，最佳N准确率达到81.8%，接近当前最优方案的82.79%，同时降低了工程复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建自然语言数据库接口提供了有前景的替代方案，尤其在模糊和未明确指定的场景中表现优异，同时减少了传统多阶段管道的复杂性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in
natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art
text-to-SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work
proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query
generation, and iterative refinement within a single, end-to-end component. By
leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates how
humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases: understanding
the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to validate them,
reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on observed results.
Crucially, our approach introduces a new strategy for scaling test-time
computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive database
exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate
computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in
ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved
the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset
using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Furthermore, when equipped with steps to
add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of
81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate generation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by
the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These
findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building
natural language interfaces to databases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实决策常需识别哪种模态包含最相关信息，但现有模型是否具备跨模态对比推理能力尚不明确。

Method: 构建Contra4数据集，包含四种模态（图像、音频、视频、3D）的对比样本，采用人工标注与模型混合验证确保数据质量。

Result: 微调使性能提升56%，但最优模型整体准确率仅56%，四模态场景下更降至42%。

Conclusion: 当前多模态模型在跨模态对比推理上存在显著局限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making often begins with identifying which modality
contains the most relevant information for a given query. While recent
multimodal models have made impressive progress in processing diverse inputs,
it remains unclear whether they can reason contrastively across multiple
modalities to select the one that best satisfies a natural language prompt. We
argue this capability is foundational, especially in retrieval-augmented and
decision-time contexts, where systems must evaluate multiple signals and
identify which one conveys the relevant information. To evaluate this skill, we
introduce Contra4, a dataset for contrastive cross-modal reasoning across four
modalities: image, audio, video, and 3D. Each example presents a natural
language question alongside multiple candidate modality instances, and the
model must select the one that semantically aligns with the prompt. Contra4
combines human-annotated captions with a mixture-of-models
round-trip-consistency filter to ensure high-quality supervision, resulting in
174k training examples and a manually verified test set of 2.3k samples. While
task-specific fine-tuning improves performance by 56% relative to baseline,
state-of-the-art models still achieve only 56% accuracy overall and 42% in
four-modality settings, underscoring a significant limitation in current
multimodal models.

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic location where a single image was
taken, visual geolocation, remains a formidable challenge due to the planet's
vastness and the deceptive similarity among distant locations. We introduce
GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small,
high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance.
GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our
geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our
SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves
robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as
on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at
sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and
aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the
SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and
efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to
prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster
further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in probabilistic modeling is balancing expressivity
and tractable inference. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) aim to directly address
this tradeoff by imposing structural constraints that guarantee efficient
inference of certain queries while maintaining expressivity. Since inference
complexity on PCs depends on circuit size, understanding the size bounds across
circuit families is key to characterizing the tradeoff between tractability and
expressive efficiency. However, expressive efficiency is often studied through
exact representations, where exactly encoding distributions while enforcing
various structural properties often incurs exponential size blow-ups. Thus, we
pose the following question: can we avoid such size blow-ups by allowing some
small approximation error? We first show that approximating an arbitrary
distribution with bounded $f$-divergence is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for any model
that can tractably compute marginals. We then prove an exponential size gap for
approximation between the class of decomposable PCs and additionally
deterministic PCs.

Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in
achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack
versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and
natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose
location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities
through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based
architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing
imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility
graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision
Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility
patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose
effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11
downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains.
Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact
128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior
general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an
average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric
modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric
tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount
(+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we
further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable
in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context
reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to
involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL
approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and
achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose
\textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning
(\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming
and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task
generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised
pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that
simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using
separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant
information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates
fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative
policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of
the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy
extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a
range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains
over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂环境中建模人类心理状态设立了新标准，通过贝叶斯原则与大模型推理的结合，实现了更好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs,
desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However,
existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with
ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability
in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases.
To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that
decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework
introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to
specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning
behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world
knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human
mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on
multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby
establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex
environments.

Conclusion: ORMind框架有效提升了大语言模型在运筹学问题中的优化能力，具有实际商业应用潜力。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making
problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing,
logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in
industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant
challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for
operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction
focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly
errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce
transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for
time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we
introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization
through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition,
implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements
into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being
tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization
capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate
that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the
NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

Motivation: 探讨多智能体LLM互动中，社会争议性议题上的偏见产生与传播机制，弥补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过模拟2500+场辩论，观察初始中立LLM智能体在5个争议话题中的立场演变过程。

Result: 统计显示智能体行为呈现群体趋同性：倾向于服从多数派或高智商智能体的观点，且后者影响力更大。

Conclusion: 强调智能体智力水平对舆论导向的关键作用，呼吁制定政策促进LLM讨论的多样性与透明度，以降低偏见传播风险。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent
systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While
previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected
attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially
contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This
study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five
contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially
neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over
time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human
behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more
intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the
crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks
of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need
for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated
discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online
environments.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular
electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown
tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural
signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new
possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain
--the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that
synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of
time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This
dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and
first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily
activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm
shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the
lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea
generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies
demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with
the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and
ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this
substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking
achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific
tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in
complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers
generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the
fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute
the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the
execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce
high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this
\textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the
fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for
the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型代理在GUI自动化任务中存在训练数据噪声大、语义多样性不足、泛化能力差以及对非英语界面支持不足等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用基于grounding-aware的预训练增强感知能力，结合高质量中英文轨迹的监督微调模仿人类行为，并通过GRPO强化微调提升推理能力，同时引入紧凑动作空间降低延迟。

Result: 在五个公共基准和新中文GUI基准CAGUI上达到最优性能，Type-Match和Exact-Match分别达到96.9%和91.3%。

Conclusion: AgentCPM-GUI通过创新的训练流程和优化设计，显著提升了GUI代理的鲁棒性和效率，为后续研究提供了可复现的代码、模型和评估数据。

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new
possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly
enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains
constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy
and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding
and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen
interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover,
most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing
diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile
ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent
built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline
includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate
human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve
reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces
output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices.
AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks
and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and
$91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we
publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ERP系统依赖静态规则，难以适应复杂业务需求，缺乏实时数据处理和动态工作流支持，亟需引入AI技术提升智能化水平。

Method: 采用生成式AI代理架构(GBPAs)，结合多智能体协调机制，实现用户意图理解、实时工作流合成及模块化任务执行。

Result: 案例研究表明：GBPAs使电汇和报销流程处理时间减少40%，错误率下降94%，并通过并行处理和语义推理提升合规性。

Conclusion: GBPAs为下一代智能ERP系统奠定基础，有效弥合生成式AI与企业级自动化之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of
modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based
workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business
operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle
to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate
dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
  In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP
systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI
Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to
enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with
business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end
automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and
wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret
user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized
sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case
studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative
financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show
that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error
rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control
insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of
GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade
automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP
systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet
interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and
collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a
definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic
analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and
deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized,
tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation
within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents
sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent
collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our
investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based
systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures.
We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms,
memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The
study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent
implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent
deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify
critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities,
and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through
enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved
coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for
practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes
foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Motivation: 强化学习在数据效率和泛化能力方面存在局限，而大语言模型具有丰富的世界知识和推理能力，可以弥补这些不足。

Method: 提出Agentic Episodic Control (AEC)架构，整合强化学习与大语言模型，利用语言嵌入和情景记忆快速检索高价值经验，并通过世界图工作记忆模块增强关系推理。

Result: 在BabyAI-Text基准测试中，AEC在复杂任务如FindObj上比最佳基线提升76%，显著提高了数据效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AEC框架结合了数值强化学习和符号推理的优势，为构建更适应性强、样本高效的智能体提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to
scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability
remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor
generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with
their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by
enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we
propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that
integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a
large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded
embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid
retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working
memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order
to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state
detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the
world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error
learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve
both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In
experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial
improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization
tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The
proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning
and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and
sample-efficient agents.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体主要依赖自然语言计划指导推理，但这种方式冗长低效且难以泛化到相似任务。因此，论文探索伪代码式计划以捕捉推理的结构逻辑。

Method: 提出伪代码式计划引导的偏好优化方法PGPO，通过两种面向计划的奖励机制，增强LLM智能体生成高质量伪代码计划和后续推理的能力。

Result: 实验表明，PGPO在代表性智能体基准测试中表现优异，优于当前领先基线，能有效减少推理中的动作错误和遗漏。

Conclusion: 伪代码式计划显著提升了LLM智能体的泛化能力和效率，PGPO方法进一步优化了智能体的推理质量。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate
natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL
plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to
generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans
(P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code
Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more
efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning
Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning.
With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability
to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments
show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks
and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of
PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

Conclusion: MLA-Trust框架揭示了多模态交互场景特有的可信漏洞，配套工具箱支持持续评估动态环境中的智能体风险。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed
interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and
dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI
applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs
introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond
traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital
states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks
inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs,
long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we
introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that
evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions:
truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and
mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive
tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving
13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness
vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance,
proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe
trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains;
the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises
trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions
that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while
enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation
across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting
in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to
facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse
interactive environments.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed
behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to
this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step
goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We
show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that
increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve
requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of
consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent
capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for
eliciting world models from agents.

Result: 在MiniGrid和MuJoCo任务上的实验表明，MAGIK仅需少量人工标注样本即可实现有效的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: MAGIK通过基于想象的类比映射，为知识迁移提供了一种新颖有效的机制。

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a
related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL)
agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share
structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose
MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to
analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach
leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their
analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original
policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK
achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of
human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and
highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer
via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models
(LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants
that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and
scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity,
they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans.
Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example,
interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the
agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by
explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to
build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior
cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans
use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we
may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and
future AI agents may be optimized.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities in various visual tasks. However, their abilities in K12 scenarios
are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various
limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of
diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method,
resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these
gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for
Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring
33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and
three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned
with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we
meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an
automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process
evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for
MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process
evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning
process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the
first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments
reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within
K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable
MLLMs.We open our resources at https://github.com/lichongod/K12Vista.

Result: 与未使用Chain-of-Thought提示推理的方法相比，该方法实现了16.7%的相对性能提升，达到了当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为痴呆症的诊断和治疗提供了新的可能性，展示了Chain-of-Thought推理在医疗领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Societies worldwide are rapidly entering a super-aged era, making elderly
health a pressing concern. The aging population is increasing the burden on
national economies and households. Dementia cases are rising significantly with
this demographic shift. Recent research using voice-based models and large
language models (LLM) offers new possibilities for dementia diagnosis and
treatment. Our Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning method combines speech and
language models. The process starts with automatic speech recognition to
convert speech to text. We add a linear layer to an LLM for Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and non-AD classification, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with CoT
reasoning and cues. This approach showed an 16.7% relative performance
improvement compared to methods without CoT prompt reasoning. To the best of
our knowledge, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance in CoT
approaches.

TL;DR: 论文构建了RealVideoQuest基准，评估文本到视频模型在回答真实世界视觉查询时的表现，发现现有模型处理此类查询存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询-答案数据集主要关注文本响应，难以满足需要视觉演示或解释的复杂用户查询，因此需要构建一个评估文本到视频模型能力的基准。

Method: 从Chatbot-Arena识别7.5K个有视频响应意图的真实用户查询，通过多阶段视频检索和精炼过程构建4.5K个高质量查询-视频对，并开发多角度评估系统。

Result: 实验表明，当前的文本到视频模型在有效回答真实用户查询方面存在困难，揭示了多模态AI的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: RealVideoQuest基准揭示了文本到视频模型在处理视觉查询时的不足，为未来多模态AI研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become
a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer
datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address
complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for
better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark,
RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V)
models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K
real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds
4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and
refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to
assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that
current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries,
pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

*Sylee Dandekar,Shripad Deshmukh,Frank Chiu,W. Bradley Knox,Scott Niekum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出人类对智能体能力的信念在RLHF偏好生成中起关键作用，并通过理论和实验验证了减少人类信念与智能体能力不匹配可提升RLHF性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF偏好建模仅基于人类奖励函数，忽略了人类对智能体能力的信念。论文探讨这种信念如何影响偏好，并提出理想信念应如何优化最终策略学习。

Method: 提出包含人类信念的新偏好模型，建立理论分析信念不匹配对策略误差的影响，并通过人工实验和合成实验验证假设。

Result: 人类信念显著影响偏好且可通过简单干预调整；合成实验证明假设智能体完全最优会导致次优偏好标注。

Conclusion: 减少人类信念与智能体能力的不匹配能提升RLHF效果，为实践者提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's
reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we
propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained
also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related
to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human
labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they
provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting
preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that
incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error
on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's
beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that
beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences
and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we
empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for
human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these
results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch
between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF
and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种超越传统内容过滤的推荐系统新范式，通过多模态生成直接创建个性化内容，如定制化图像，以更好地满足用户需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统仅能过滤现有内容，无法生成新颖概念，限制了其满足用户需求和偏好的能力。为解决这一问题，论文探索了直接生成个性化多模态内容的方法。

Method: 利用任意到任意的大型多模态模型（LMMs），通过监督微调和在线强化学习策略训练模型，使其能够为用户生成定制化的下一项内容。

Result: 在两个基准数据集和用户研究上的实验证实了该方法的有效性。生成的图像不仅与用户历史偏好一致，还与其潜在未来兴趣相关。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态生成方法为推荐系统开辟了新方向，能够更全面地满足用户需求和偏好，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents,
recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized
results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to
filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts,
limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and
selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as
images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage
any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the
ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably,
the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but
also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

TL;DR: 论文提出自挑战框架，通过让智能体自我生成高质量任务来训练工具使用能力，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练能使用工具的智能体需要大量人工标注的多样化任务和评估标准，成本高昂且难以扩展。

Method: 采用自挑战框架：智能体先作为挑战者生成Code-as-Task形式任务（含指令、验证函数及测试用例），再作为执行者通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在M3ToolEval和TauBench基准上，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型性能提升超过两倍。

Conclusion: 仅用自生成数据即可高效训练工具使用智能体，为降低标注依赖提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent
agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is
challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set
of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are
generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates
a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a
novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an
instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve
as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes
an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using
the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn
tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging
framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
despite using only self-generated training data.

Method: 采用整合分析方法，研究A2A协议（标准化通信）与MCP协议（结构化I/O框架）的协同机制。

Result: 证明两种协议互补可提升异构智能体协作效率，并增强复杂智能体生态系统的互操作性。

Conclusion: A2A与MCP的协同应用为构建实用化AI系统提供了有效的协议级解决方案。

Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation
methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by
Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the
evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient
interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems
remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between
autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential
elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized
communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous
environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O
framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior
studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A
or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach,
exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address
interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex
agent ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估范式忽视道德能动性和复杂决策能力，随着AI在多智能体环境中的集成，亟需新的评估框架。

Method: 受人类与动物伦理互动的启发，设计Shepherd测试框架，聚焦AI的操纵、培育、工具化使用等能力。

Conclusion: 该测试为AI治理提供新范式，需开发模拟环境来形式化多智能体系统中的伦理操纵行为。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing
the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The
test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical
considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of
asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important,
and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the
ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents,
while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the
ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of
subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation
paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex
decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical
for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly
integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key
research directions, including the development of simulation environments for
testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation
within multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨元学习是否能够实现类似人类的系统性组合性，回应Fodor和Pylyshyn关于神经网络缺乏组合性能力的经典论点。

Method: 通过分析现有的元学习框架，评估其在组合性任务上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，现代神经元学习系统仅在非常狭窄和受限的元学习设置下才能实现组合性任务。

Conclusion: Fodor和Pylyshyn的论点仍然成立，迄今为止，神经网络尚未实现类似人类的系统性组合性学习。

Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are
emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of
today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel
environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about
the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to
scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks
inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional
representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable
model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a
pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this
claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for
compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems
can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted
definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and
Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic
compositionality learned in neural networks.

Motivation: 现有任务型对话系统面临用户语义完整但结构信息缺失的挑战，且当前基于LLM的代理缺乏协作式意图形成的分析框架。

Method: 提出STORM框架，通过UserLLM（全内部访问）和AgentLLM（仅观察行为）的对话建模信息不对称性，生成标注语料追踪表达轨迹与潜在认知转变。

Result: 实验表明：适度不确定性表现优于完全透明；不同模型呈现特定模式，需重新思考人机协作中最优信息完整度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非对称推理动态机制，为不确定性校准的对话系统设计提供新见解。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances
seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for
appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully
understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions.
Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically
complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for
collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling
asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full
internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces
annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive
transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding
development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information
processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking
collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring
internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across
four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform
complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns
suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI
collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning
dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Method: 引入COALESCE框架，整合技能表示、动态发现、任务分解、成本模型、市场决策算法和标准化通信协议。

Result: 理论模拟显示成本降低41.8%，实际任务验证成本降低20.3%，证明了框架的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: COALESCE框架通过动态市场机制降低运营成本，提升可扩展性，促进专业化代理经济的发展。

Abstract: The meteoric rise and proliferation of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM)
agents promise significant capabilities across various domains. However, their
deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands,
specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses
the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems.
We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via
Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable
autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to
specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates
mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated
task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs
against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making
algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents.
Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates
41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across
240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy
exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical
effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's
Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like
COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By
facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing
protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce
operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of
specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more
accessible and economically viable.

Conclusion: 集成方法为模型适应提供了一种更有效的解决方案，理论分析和实验结果一致支持其优势。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data is the dominant approach
for adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. However, it has been
observed that SFT models tend to forget knowledge acquired during pretraining.
In vision models, ensembling a pretrained model with its fine-tuned counterpart
has been shown to mitigate this issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the
same holds for language models, and, more strikingly, we observe an
overadaptation phenomenon: the ensemble model not only retains general
knowledge from the foundation model but also outperforms the fine-tuned model
even on the fine-tuning domain itself. Despite the empirical success of
ensembling, a theoretical understanding of its benefits remains underexplored.
We develop a formal theoretical analysis of the overadaptation phenomenon.
Ensembling mitigates this by balancing two primary sources of error: bias,
caused by insufficient fine-tuning, and variance, introduced by overfitting to
fine-tuning data. While regularization techniques aim to address this
trade-off, we show that ensembling provides a more effective solution. We
analyze this phenomenon in over-parameterized linear settings and demonstrate
that interpolating between pretrained and fine-tuned weights significantly
improves performance. These findings offer theoretical justification for the
observed advantages of model ensembling, supported by empirical experiments
consistent with our analysis.

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示开发者可能通过训练消除CoT中有害意图的表象，导致推理痕迹被掩盖但不良行为仍持续，威胁CoT监控的可靠性。

Method: 方法包括惩罚承载推理痕迹的特定字符串，观察模型是否学会替代性编码，并测试模型能否推广编码方案至同类未训练字符串。

Result: 结果表明模型能通过替代字符串实现隐写编码，且可推广编码方案至同类新字符串，但底层任务执行方法未改变。

Conclusion: 结论指出单纯压制CoT中的敏感字符串无法消除不良行为，反而促使模型发展出更隐蔽的编码方案，需开发更可靠的监控方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model
performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes,
marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By
proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or
harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with
deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the
appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or
regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a
specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT
presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes
obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the
undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT
monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization
to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide
an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of
specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to
substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying
method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can
learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that
models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to
an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in
training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the
class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Conclusion: RoboEgo成功实现全双工多模态处理，性能优越，突破了全双工系统此前被认为无法达到的界限。

Abstract: Humans naturally process real-world multimodal information in a full-duplex
manner. In artificial intelligence, replicating this capability is essential
for advancing model development and deployment, particularly in embodied
contexts. The development of multimodal models faces two primary challenges:
(1) effectively handling more than three modalities-such as vision, audio, and
text; and (2) delivering full-duplex responses to rapidly evolving human
instructions. To facilitate research on models that support both omnimodal
processing and full duplexity, we present RoboEgo (alias: FLM-Ego), a unified
model system designed to address both challenges. RoboEgo incorporates a
backbone architecture and algorithms that natively support full duplexity,
achieving a theoretical duplex latency of 80 ms. In streaming visually grounded
conversations under real-world conditions, RoboEgo exhibits superior
responsiveness and speech naturalness, while maintaining comparable content
qualities to state-of-the-art semi-duplex omnimodal models-a feat previously
considered unattainable by native full-duplex systems.

Method: 1) 使用Shapley值动态调度训练顺序，优先学习欠优化模态；2) 引入记忆模块和跨模态映射机制，细化模态特征对齐；3) 支持传统与LLM编码器混合架构。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得SOTA，新提出的均衡偏差指标(EDM)验证了方法的平衡性，模态缺失实验展现了强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 交替训练策略通过模态优先级动态调整，能根本性平衡多模态学习，为优化多模态训练动态提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is susceptible to modality imbalance, where dominant
modalities overshadow weak ones, easily leading to biased learning and
suboptimal fusion, especially for incomplete modality conditions. To address
this problem, we propose a Shapley-guided alternating training framework that
adaptively prioritizes minor modalities to balance and thus enhance the fusion.
Our method leverages Shapley Value-based scheduling to improve the training
sequence adaptively, ensuring that under-optimized modalities receive
sufficient learning. Additionally, we introduce the memory module to refine and
inherit modality-specific representations with a cross-modal mapping mechanism
to align features at both the feature and sample levels. To further validate
the adaptability of the proposed approach, the encoder module empirically
adopts both conventional and LLM-based backbones. With building up a novel
multimodal equilibrium metric, namely, equilibrium deviation metric (EDM), we
evaluate the performance in both balance and accuracy across four multimodal
benchmark datasets, where our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.
Meanwhile, robustness analysis under missing modalities highlights its strong
generalization capabilities. Accordingly, our findings reveal the untapped
potential of alternating training, demonstrating that strategic modality
prioritization fundamentally balances and promotes multimodal learning,
offering a new paradigm for optimizing multimodal training dynamics.

convolution and customized activation functions. Our model was compared against
several models, namely fNIRSNET, MDNN, DeepConvNet, and ShallowConvNet. The
results showed that AbsoluteNet outperforms existing models, reaching 87.0%
accuracy, 84.8% sensitivity, and 89.2% specificity in binary classification,
surpassing fNIRSNET, the second-best model, by 3.8% in accuracy. These findings
underscore the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning model in decoding
hemodynamic responses related to auditory processing and highlight the
importance of spatio-temporal feature aggregation and customized activation
functions to better fit fNIRS dynamics.

*Simon Sinong Zhan,Qingyuan Wu,Frank Yang,Xiangyu Shi,Chao Huang,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DT-CORL框架，通过Transformer结构预测延迟状态，提升离线强化学习在延迟环境中的鲁棒性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在部署时面临两个问题：仿真与现实的差异（如延迟）和交互数据不足导致的分布外状态。传统方法在延迟环境下性能下降，需要一种能处理延迟且高效的方法。

Method: DT-CORL框架结合Transformer信念预测器，即使训练时未接触延迟观测，也能生成抗延迟动作，且比简单的历史增强基线更高效。

Result: 在多种延迟设置的D4RL基准测试中，DT-CORL表现优于历史增强和传统信念方法，缩小了仿真与现实的延迟差距，同时保持数据效率。

Conclusion: DT-CORL有效解决了离线强化学习在延迟环境中的部署问题，为实际应用提供了更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must
bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and
other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap,
where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during
online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky.
Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to
dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free
logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt
performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained
Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at
deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based
belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during
training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive
history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several
delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both
history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the
sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

*Idan Attias,Steve Hanneke,Arvind Ramaswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在线学习和转导在线学习中，学习者仅通过经验风险最小化（ERM）或弱一致性预言机与概念类交互的情况，证明了在标准在线设置中的紧下界，并探讨了转导在线模型中的最优错误界限和预言机调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索学习者在仅通过ERM或弱一致性预言机与概念类交互时的在线学习性能，区别于传统在线学习中学习者已知整个概念类的情况。

Method: 论文通过理论分析，比较了使用ERM和弱一致性预言机在不同设置（标准在线和转导在线）下的性能，包括错误次数和预言机调用次数。

Result: 结果表明，在标准在线设置中，ERM访问下存在紧下界；在转导在线模型中，可以实现最优错误界限，但需要较多预言机调用。此外，随机化算法可以减少某些概念类的预言机调用次数。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，限制学习者的预言机调用次数对在线学习的可行性至关重要，且随机化算法可以在保持类似错误界限的同时减少预言机调用次数。

Abstract: We study online and transductive online learning when the learner interacts
with the concept class only via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) or weak
consistency oracles on arbitrary instance subsets. This contrasts with standard
online models, where the learner knows the entire class. The ERM oracle returns
a hypothesis minimizing loss on a given subset, while the weak consistency
oracle returns a binary signal indicating whether the subset is realizable by
some concept. The learner is evaluated by the number of mistakes and oracle
calls. In the standard online setting with ERM access, we prove tight lower
bounds in both realizable and agnostic cases: $\Omega(2^{d_{VC}})$ mistakes and
$\Omega(\sqrt{T 2^{d_{LD}}})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of timesteps and
$d_{LD}$ is the Littlestone dimension. We further show that existing online
learning results with ERM access carry over to the weak consistency setting,
incurring an additional $O(T)$ in oracle calls. We then consider the
transductive online model, where the instance sequence is known but labels are
revealed sequentially. For general Littlestone classes, we show that optimal
realizable and agnostic mistake bounds can be achieved using $O(T^{d_{VC}+1})$
weak consistency oracle calls. On the negative side, we show that limiting the
learner to $\Omega(T)$ weak consistency queries is necessary for transductive
online learnability, and that restricting the learner to $\Omega(T)$ ERM
queries is necessary to avoid exponential dependence on the Littlestone
dimension. Finally, for certain concept classes, we reduce oracle calls via
randomized algorithms while maintaining similar mistake bounds. In particular,
for Thresholds on an unknown ordering, $O(\log T)$ ERM queries suffice; for
$k$-Intervals, $O(T^3 2^{2k})$ weak consistency queries suffice.

*Magdalena Proszewska,Nikolay Malkin,N. Siddharth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散自编码器（DAs）通过改进潜在变量建模和采样方法，结合扩散模型的优势，实现了更高效的生成和下游任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散自编码器（DAs）在生成性能上依赖于潜在变量的建模和采样质量，而另一类扩散模型通过学习前向噪声过程来优化生成性能。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过特定的设计决策（如潜在变量选择和条件方法），提出了一种称为DMZ的模型，结合了DAs和扩散模型的优点。

Result: DMZ模型在下游任务（如领域迁移）中表现出色，同时生成效率更高，所需的去噪步骤更少。

Conclusion: DMZ模型成功结合了扩散自编码器和扩散模型的优势，在表示学习和生成效率上均取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are variants of diffusion generative models that
use an input-dependent latent variable to capture representations alongside the
diffusion process. These representations, to varying extents, can be used for
tasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and
interpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how
well the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better
generative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion
models -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at
adjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy
additional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion
process. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and
show that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning
method, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us
to obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on
downstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient
modelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.

Motivation: 预训练模型常难以对齐人类偏好或商业目标，而高质量标注数据获取成本高。企业拥有大量未充分利用的历史观测数据，但直接使用会导致虚假相关性。

Method: 提出DeconfoundLM方法，显式去除已知混杂变量对奖励信号的影响，通过模拟实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能更好恢复因果关系，缓解直接使用观测数据微调导致的模型失效问题。

Conclusion: 经过因果校正的观测数据可成为LLM对齐的强大信号源，但需注意混杂变量处理。

Abstract: Large language models are being widely used across industries to generate
content that contributes directly to key performance metrics, such as
conversion rates. Pretrained models, however, often fall short when it comes to
aligning with human preferences or optimizing for business objectives. As a
result, fine-tuning with good-quality labeled data is essential to guide models
to generate content that achieves better results. Controlled experiments, like
A/B tests, can provide such data, but they are often expensive and come with
significant engineering and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, companies have
access to a vast amount of historical (observational) data that remains
underutilized. In this work, we study the challenges and opportunities of
fine-tuning LLMs using observational data. We show that while observational
outcomes can provide valuable supervision, directly fine-tuning models on such
data can lead them to learn spurious correlations. We present empirical
evidence of this issue using various real-world datasets and propose
DeconfoundLM, a method that explicitly removes the effect of known confounders
from reward signals. Using simulation experiments, we demonstrate that
DeconfoundLM improves the recovery of causal relationships and mitigates
failure modes found in fine-tuning methods that ignore or naively incorporate
confounding variables. Our findings highlight that while observational data
presents risks, with the right causal corrections, it can be a powerful source
of signal for LLM alignment. Please refer to the project page for code and

Motivation: 尽管一阶方法在隐私保护方面已有广泛研究，但零阶方法的隐私分析和算法设计仍未被充分探索，特别是在隐藏状态差分隐私分析方面存在空白。

Method: 通过将隐私放大迭代框架推广到零阶优化中的平滑损失函数场景，进行理论分析和算法设计。

Result: 成功建立了零阶优化的收敛差分隐私边界，并提出了优于现有文献的隐私保护零阶算法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了零阶优化隐私分析的理论空白，为隐私敏感场景下的模型微调提供了新方法。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization has emerged as a promising approach for fine-tuning
large language models on domain-specific data, particularly under differential
privacy (DP) and memory constraints. While first-order methods have been
extensively studied from a privacy perspective, the privacy analysis and
algorithmic design for zeroth-order methods remain significantly underexplored.
A critical open question concerns hidden-state DP analysis: although convergent
privacy bounds are known for first-order methods, it has remained unclear
whether similar guarantees can be established for zeroth-order methods. In this
work, we provide an affirmative answer by proving a convergent DP bound for
zeroth-order optimization. Our analysis generalizes the celebrated privacy
amplification-by-iteration framework to the setting of smooth loss functions in
zeroth-order optimization. Furthermore, it induces better DP zeroth-order
algorithmic designs that are previously unknown to the literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为解耦安全适配器（DSA）的新框架，通过将安全计算与基础模型分离，实现了高效且灵活的AI安全保障，显著提升了安全性能并减少了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法（如护栏模型和对齐训练）往往在推理效率或开发灵活性上有所妥协，因此需要一种更高效、灵活且模块化的解决方案。

Method: DSA框架通过轻量级适配器利用基础模型的内部表示，将安全功能与任务优化的基础模型解耦，从而在不显著增加推理成本的情况下实现多样化的安全功能。

Result: 实验表明，DSA在幻觉检测（AUC 0.88 vs. 0.61）、仇恨言论分类（0.98 vs. 0.92）及不安全输入/响应识别（0.93 vs. 0.90）上显著优于同类独立模型，同时支持动态调整对齐强度，在保持性能的同时大幅提升安全性。

Conclusion: DSA为AI安全和模型对齐提供了一种模块化、高效且适应性强的解决方案，显著降低了传统方法带来的性能损失。

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and
alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development
flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework
addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a
task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the
base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety
functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based
safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models,
notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and
also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe
model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails).
Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time
adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between
instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the
DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent
alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining
98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8
percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall,
DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI
safety and alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Breakpoint基准方法，通过自动生成代码修复任务评估大语言模型的长时推理能力，并展示其可扩展至任意难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型基准主要评估短时、局部推理能力，而真实任务（如软件工程）需要动态理解复杂结构。手动构建长时基准成本高且易饱和，需自动化生成多样化问题集。

Method: Breakpoint通过对抗性破坏真实软件仓库中的函数，自动生成代码修复任务，并系统性控制代码复杂度（局部推理）和调用图中心性（系统级推理）两个难度维度。

Result: 在900多个生成任务上的实验表明，该方法可扩展至任意难度，最先进模型在简单任务上成功率55%，最难任务上降至0%。

Conclusion: Breakpoint为评估大语言模型的长时推理能力提供了可扩展的自动化基准，揭示了当前模型处理复杂任务的局限性。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) have predominantly assessed
short-horizon, localized reasoning. Existing long-horizon suites (e.g.
SWE-bench) rely on manually curated issues, so expanding or tuning difficulty
demands expensive human effort and evaluations quickly saturate. However, many
real-world tasks, such as software engineering or scientific research, require
agents to rapidly comprehend and manipulate novel, complex structures
dynamically; evaluating these capabilities requires the ability to construct
large and varied sets of problems for agents to solve. We introduce Breakpoint,
a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by
adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories.
Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two clear dimensions:
local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic
complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality
and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In
experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that our
methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models'
success rates ranging from 55% on the easiest tasks down to 0% on the hardest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI开发流程包含多个阶段（预训练、微调、对齐等），每个阶段有多次模型更新。当部署的模型成功或失败时，需要明确哪个阶段负责及其影响程度，即问责归属问题。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过一阶近似估计器回答反事实问题（如某训练阶段未执行时模型行为如何变化），量化阶段影响，同时考虑训练数据和优化动态（学习率、动量、权重衰减等）。

Result: 实验证明，该方法能有效识别导致特定行为的训练阶段，为模型分析提供实用工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI开发提供了可问责的分析方法，通过量化训练阶段影响推动更透明的模型开发。

Abstract: Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining,
fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model
update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of
accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is
responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability
attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the
training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers
counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have
changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within
this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations
that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators
account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics,
including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for
specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step
toward more accountable AI development.

Motivation: 研究分布式优化算法在复杂噪声环境下的动态行为，特别是自适应方法与传统方法在收敛性上的差异。

Method: 使用随机微分方程(SDE)近似分析分布式SGD、压缩SGD和SignSGD的动态特性。

Result: 发现自适应方法如SignSGD能在重尾噪声下收敛，而传统分布式SGD需依赖梯度范数的逆调整学习率才能收敛。

Conclusion: 自适应方法在复杂噪声条件下具有更强的鲁棒性，为分布式优化算法的设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations, we study the
dynamics of Distributed SGD, Distributed Compressed SGD, and Distributed
SignSGD under $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness and flexible noise assumptions. Our
analysis provides insights -- which we validate through simulation -- into the
intricate interactions between batch noise, stochastic gradient compression,
and adaptivity in this modern theoretical setup. For instance, we show that
\textit{adaptive} methods such as Distributed SignSGD can successfully converge
under standard assumptions on the learning rate scheduler, even under
heavy-tailed noise. On the contrary, Distributed (Compressed) SGD with
pre-scheduled decaying learning rate fails to achieve convergence, unless such
a schedule also accounts for an inverse dependency on the gradient norm -- de
facto falling back into an adaptive method.

Conclusion: 该模型通过聚类感知和因果机制有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of anomalies in time series data is critical,
given the significant risks associated with false or missed detections. While
MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a
causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system.
Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels
with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all
channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively
detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into
clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a
dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our
model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we
present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence
over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed
model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time
time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1
scores.

Conclusion: 该研究为计算MOF发现开辟了新途径，展示了数据驱动方法与强化学习结合在加速材料设计中的广阔前景。

Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific
properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the
immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional
computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density
functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at
scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging
data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of
MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates
both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To
address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced,
transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our
approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both
connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline
comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid
sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a
reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via
property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into
sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable,
topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work
demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with
reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and
unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

Motivation: 受人类学习过程中顺序回顾任务以减少遗忘的启发，研究者质疑当前广泛使用的并行排练策略是否总是最优，并探索顺序排练是否能为连续学习带来更大益处。

Method: 通过理论分析过参数化线性模型中的排练策略，比较并行排练（同时训练新旧数据）和顺序排练（先训练新数据再顺序回顾旧数据），并提出混合排练方法（相似任务并行训练，不相似任务顺序回顾）。

Result: 理论分析和深度神经网络实验表明，当任务相似度较低时，顺序排练优于并行排练；混合排练方法在整体表现上超越标准并行排练。

Conclusion: 该研究首次对基于排练的连续学习进行了全面理论分析，提出的混合排练方法通过动态调整排练策略，有效平衡了遗忘和泛化性能。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based methods have shown superior performance in addressing
catastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by storing and training on a
subset of past data alongside new data in current task. While such a concurrent
rehearsal strategy is widely used, it remains unclear if this approach is
always optimal. Inspired by human learning, where sequentially revisiting tasks
helps mitigate forgetting, we explore whether sequential rehearsal can offer
greater benefits for CL compared to standard concurrent rehearsal. To address
this question, we conduct a theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL in
overparameterized linear models, comparing two strategies: 1) Concurrent
Rehearsal, where past and new data are trained together, and 2) Sequential
Rehearsal, where new data is trained first, followed by revisiting past data
sequentially. By explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error,
we show that sequential rehearsal performs better when tasks are less similar.
These insights further motivate a novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which trains
similar tasks concurrently and revisits dissimilar tasks sequentially. We
characterize its forgetting and generalization performance, and our experiments
with deep neural networks further confirm that the hybrid approach outperforms
standard concurrent rehearsal. This work provides the first comprehensive
theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical

millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative

demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩结构，可能忽略参数空间中的空间模式，限制了表达能力和适应性。

Method: 提出Localized LoRA框架，将权重更新建模为作用于权重矩阵结构化块的局部低秩矩阵组合，实现密集局部更新。

updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global
low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the
parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized
framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices
applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables
dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the
total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between
global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show
that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched
parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings
demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable
alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved
performance.

*Pintu Kumar,Nandyala Hemachandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出DeGLIF方法，利用留一影响函数和小规模干净数据对图数据进行去噪，提升节点级预测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 带噪声标注的图数据成本较低，但噪声会影响模型性能。现有方法需已知噪声模型或噪声水平，限制了实际应用。

Method: 基于留一影响函数估计训练节点移除对验证损失的影响，结合理论推导的重标注函数，提出两种无需噪声先验的DeGLIF变体。

Result: 实验表明DeGLIF优于基线方法，其中一种变体被理论证明能有效识别增加风险的噪声点。

Conclusion: DeGLIF为图数据去噪提供了无需噪声先验的有效解决方案，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Noisy labelled datasets are generally inexpensive compared to clean labelled
datasets, and the same is true for graph data. In this paper, we propose a
denoising technique DeGLIF: Denoising Graph Data using Leave-One-Out Influence
Function. DeGLIF uses a small set of clean data and the leave-one-out influence
function to make label noise robust node-level prediction on graph data.
Leave-one-out influence function approximates the change in the model
parameters if a training point is removed from the training dataset. Recent
advances propose a way to calculate the leave-one-out influence function for
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We extend that recent work to estimate the change
in validation loss, if a training node is removed from the training dataset. We
use this estimate and a new theoretically motivated relabelling function to
denoise the training dataset. We propose two DeGLIF variants to identify noisy
nodes. Both these variants do not require any information about the noise model
or the noise level in the dataset; DeGLIF also does not estimate these
quantities. For one of these variants, we prove that the noisy points detected
can indeed increase risk. We carry out detailed computational experiments on
different datasets to show the effectiveness of DeGLIF. It achieves better
accuracy than other baseline algorithms

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最近邻熵估计的黑盒不确定性量化方法，改进语义熵在长单句生成中的局限性，并在多种任务和模型上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义熵（SE）方法在长单句生成场景下效果下降，因其忽略了语义簇内相似性和簇间相似性这两个关键因素。

Method: 提出受最近邻熵估计启发的黑盒不确定性量化方法，可结合词元概率扩展至白盒场景，理论证明其能泛化语义熵。

Result: 在Phi3/Llama3模型和问答、摘要、翻译任务中，新方法相比语义熵表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进语义簇层面的不确定性测量，为LLM幻觉检测提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing
the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic
entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty
at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer
one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two
crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and
inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these
limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method
inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be
easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities.
Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method
generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its
effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and
Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text
summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合量子计算和经典SGD的混合优化方法，用于加速CNN训练，在MNIST数据集上取得了比传统方法更高的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN训练方法（如反向传播）计算资源消耗大且可能收敛不佳，量子计算因其高效搜索复杂优化空间的潜力成为有前景的替代方案。

Method: 采用混合优化方法，将无约束二进制二次规划（UBQP）与随机梯度下降（SGD）结合，以提升CNN训练效率。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，该方法比标准BP-CNN基线准确率提升10-15%，同时保持相近的执行时间。

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典技术在高性能计算和大数据场景中具有潜力，但需注意算法结构与量子机制的匹配。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are pivotal in computer vision and Big
Data analytics but demand significant computational resources when trained on
large-scale datasets. Conventional training via back-propagation (BP) with
losses like Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy often requires extensive
iterations and may converge sub-optimally. Quantum computing offers a promising
alternative by leveraging superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to search
complex optimization landscapes more efficiently. In this work, we propose a
hybrid optimization method that combines an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic
Programming (UBQP) formulation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to
accelerate CNN training. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, our approach achieves
a 10--15\% accuracy improvement over a standard BP-CNN baseline while
maintaining similar execution times. These results illustrate the potential of
hybrid quantum-classical techniques in High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments for Big Data and Deep Learning. Fully realizing these benefits,
however, requires a careful alignment of algorithmic structures with underlying
quantum mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于排列的视觉变换器方法PerFormer，用于处理多变量时间序列数据以预测剩余使用寿命（RUL），在NASA的C-MAPSS数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉变换器（ViT）在计算机视觉任务中展现出优于卷积神经网络（CNN）的性能，研究者希望探索其在RUL预测中的潜力。然而，直接将ViT应用于多变量传感器数据存在空间信息模糊的挑战。

Method: 提出了PerFormer方法，通过排列多变量时间序列数据模拟图像数据的空间特性，使其适用于ViT。同时设计了一种新的排列损失函数来生成所需的排列矩阵。

Result: 在NASA的C-MAPSS数据集上的实验表明，PerFormer在RUL预测上的性能优于使用CNN、RNN和其他变换器模型的先进方法。

Conclusion: PerFormer在预测和健康管理（PHM）应用中展现出高效性和潜力，为RUL预测提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems
is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video
recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating
remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer
(ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image
classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural
inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy.
Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL
prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial
information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the
PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute
multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image
data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation
matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the
convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on
NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL
prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its
effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在具有递归熵风险偏好的马尔可夫决策过程中，学习最优状态-动作价值函数和最优策略的样本复杂度，提出了MB-RS-QVI方法，并证明了其PAC界限的紧致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在风险敏感环境下，如何高效学习马尔可夫决策过程的最优价值函数和策略，特别是在存在递归熵风险偏好的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种基于模型的方法，称为MB-RS-QVI（基于模型的风险敏感Q值迭代），用于学习最优Q值和策略。

Result: 证明了MB-RS-QVI方法的PAC界限在ε和δ上是紧致的，并且在动作数量A上，Q学习的PAC界限是紧致的，策略学习的PAC界限接近紧致。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在风险敏感环境下，学习最优Q值和策略的样本复杂度对有效时间跨度和风险敏感度具有指数依赖性，且这种依赖性是不可避免的。

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal
state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted
Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic
risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model
of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach
which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which
leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and
$\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations
and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have
exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the
strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$.
We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on
$|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds
reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and
that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and
that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

### [349] [Improving Protein Sequence Design through Designability Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00297)
*Fanglei Xue,Andrew Kubaney,Zhichun Guo,Joseph K. Min,Ge Liu,Yi Yang,David Baker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的蛋白质序列设计方法，通过优化设计性（designability）而非序列恢复（sequence recovery），显著提高了计算机模拟设计成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质序列设计方法虽然在序列生成方面表现良好，但其训练目标（序列恢复）并不能保证设计性（即设计的序列能否折叠成目标结构）。因此，需要一种新的方法来提高设计性。

Method: 论文提出了两种方法：1) 使用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)和AlphaFold pLDDT分数作为偏好信号，优化序列生成；2) 引入Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO)，在残基级别上应用结构奖励并解耦优化。最终通过微调LigandMPNN得到EnhancedMPNN。

Result: 在具有挑战性的酶设计基准测试中，EnhancedMPNN的计算机模拟设计成功率从6.56%提高到17.57%，提升了近3倍。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义训练目标并引入残基级别的优化方法，论文显著提高了蛋白质序列的设计性，为蛋白质设计领域提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in
sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training
objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the
likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge
this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation
toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal,
which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further
refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce
Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies
residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues.
This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that
already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations,
we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a
nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%)
on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于进化算法的扩散模型对齐框架，能在推理时高效优化可微和不可微的对齐目标，显著降低计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽在各领域表现优异，但其生成样本常无法满足下游目标（如安全约束或领域有效性）。现有对齐方法需梯度、模型内部访问或高算力。

Method: 将扩散模型视为黑盒，通过进化算法搜索其潜在空间以最大化对齐目标，支持可微/不可微目标。

Result: 在DrawBench和Open Image Preferences基准上超越现有梯度/无梯度方法，GPU内存降低55%-76%，速度提升72%-80%，对齐分数更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型提供了高效、低资源的推理时对齐方案，扩展了模型在实际场景中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art generative models in various domains,
yet their samples often fail to satisfy downstream objectives such as safety
constraints or domain-specific validity. Existing techniques for alignment
require gradients, internal model access, or large computational budgets. We
introduce an inference-time alignment framework based on evolutionary
algorithms. We treat diffusion models as black-boxes and search their latent
space to maximize alignment objectives. Our method enables efficient
inference-time alignment for both differentiable and non-differentiable
alignment objectives across a range of diffusion models. On the DrawBench and
Open Image Preferences benchmark, our EA methods outperform state-of-the-art
gradient-based and gradient-free inference-time methods. In terms of memory
consumption, we require 55% to 76% lower GPU memory than gradient-based
methods. In terms of running-time, we are 72% to 80% faster than gradient-based
methods. We achieve higher alignment scores over 50 optimization steps on Open
Image Preferences than gradient-based and gradient-free methods.

Conclusion: MCS-Set为多模态模型基准测试、标注实践的进步以及可访问、多功能的材料科学数据集奠定了基础，相关数据和实现已开源。

Abstract: Most materials science datasets are limited to atomic geometries (e.g., XYZ
files), restricting their utility for multimodal learning and comprehensive
data-centric analysis. These constraints have historically impeded the adoption
of advanced machine learning techniques in the field. This work introduces
MultiCrystalSpectrumSet (MCS-Set), a curated framework that expands materials
datasets by integrating atomic structures with 2D projections and structured
textual annotations, including lattice parameters and coordination metrics.
MCS-Set enables two key tasks: (1) multimodal property and summary prediction,
and (2) constrained crystal generation with partial cluster supervision.
Leveraging a human-in-the-loop pipeline, MCS-Set combines domain expertise with
standardized descriptors for high-quality annotation. Evaluations using
state-of-the-art language and vision-language models reveal substantial
modality-specific performance gaps and highlight the importance of annotation
quality for generalization. MCS-Set offers a foundation for benchmarking
multimodal models, advancing annotation practices, and promoting accessible,
versatile materials science datasets. The dataset and implementations are

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于替代风险最小化的主动学习框架，适用于多类分类问题，放宽了传统可实现性假设的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于替代的主动学习算法严重依赖可实现性假设（即最优替代预测器存在于模型类中），这限制了它们在实践中的适用性。本文旨在放宽这一假设，使算法在更广泛的非可实现性场景中有效。

Method: 提出了一种基于epoch的主动学习算法，通过在每一轮中拟合完整模型类的数据，并返回通过聚合这些模型得到的不当分类器。

Result: 在比可实现性更弱的条件下，只要模型类是凸的，仍能获得与之前工作相当的标签和样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 该算法在非可实现性设置中表现优于现有方法，扩展了主动学习算法的适用性。

Abstract: We present a new active learning framework for multiclass classification
based on surrogate risk minimization that operates beyond the standard
realizability assumption. Existing surrogate-based active learning algorithms
crucially rely on realizability$\unicode{x2014}$the assumption that the optimal
surrogate predictor lies within the model class$\unicode{x2014}$limiting their
applicability in practical, misspecified settings. In this work we show that
under conditions significantly weaker than realizability, as long as the class
of models considered is convex, one can still obtain a label and sample
complexity comparable to prior work. Despite achieving similar rates, the
algorithmic approaches from prior works can be shown to fail in non-realizable
settings where our assumption is satisfied. Our epoch-based active learning
algorithm departs from prior methods by fitting a model from the full class to
the queried data in each epoch and returning an improper classifier obtained by
aggregating these models.

TL;DR: Foresight提出了一种自适应层重用技术，减少扩散变换器在视频生成中的计算冗余，保持性能的同时提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在文本到图像、视频生成和编辑中表现优异，但其大模型尺寸和时空注意力的二次计算成本使得视频生成计算昂贵。静态缓存虽能跨固定步骤重用特征，但无法适应生成动态，导致速度与质量的次优权衡。

Method: Foresight是一种自适应层重用技术，动态识别并重用DiT块在所有去噪步骤中的输出，根据生成参数（如分辨率和去噪计划）调整以优化效率。

Result: 在OpenSora、Latte和CogVideoX上应用Foresight，实现了最高1.63倍的端到端加速，同时保持视频质量。

Conclusion: Foresight通过自适应层重用显著提升了扩散变换器在视频生成中的计算效率，同时保持了基线性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large
model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple
denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching
mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to
generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and
quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces
computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline
performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for
all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution
and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and
CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining
video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的模型在医疗时间序列信号分类中表现优异，但其复杂的架构和不透明的推理过程在高风险的临床环境中降低了可信度。因此，研究转向强调结构透明性的建模范式。

Method: 提出了通道强制融合（CIF）方法，通过跨通道信息融合提高信噪比，减少冗余，并结合时间卷积网络（TCN）构建高效且明确的分类框架。

Result: 在多个公开的EEG和ECG数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在分类指标上优于现有最先进方法，并显著提高了分类过程的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了医疗时间序列信号的分类性能，还通过增强透明度为临床决策提供了更可信的支持，为医疗时间序列分类提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in
clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer
based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal
dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex
architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in
high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study
shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural
transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of
medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion,
effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance.
Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN),
known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to
construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental
results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly
enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel
perspective for medical time series classification.

Conclusion: FSNet实现了速度与可行性的平衡，为实时约束优化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently solving constrained optimization problems is crucial for numerous
real-world applications, yet traditional solvers are often computationally
prohibitive for real-time use. Machine learning-based approaches have emerged
as a promising alternative to provide approximate solutions at faster speeds,
but they struggle to strictly enforce constraints, leading to infeasible
solutions in practice. To address this, we propose the
Feasibility-Seeking-Integrated Neural Network (FSNet), which integrates a
feasibility-seeking step directly into its solution procedure to ensure
constraint satisfaction. This feasibility-seeking step solves an unconstrained
optimization problem that minimizes constraint violations in a differentiable
manner, enabling end-to-end training and providing guarantees on feasibility
and convergence. Our experiments across a range of different optimization
problems, including both smooth/nonsmooth and convex/nonconvex problems,
demonstrate that FSNet can provide feasible solutions with solution quality
comparable to (or in some cases better than) traditional solvers, at
significantly faster speeds.

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large
language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and
robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to
specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent
analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In
contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical
layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered
Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in
representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern
that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis
further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal
components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.
We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain
adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction
compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them
reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

Motivation: 现代软件系统对运行时性能要求越来越高，尤其是在远内存等新兴架构中，本地内存未命中会导致显著延迟。机器学习在离线系统优化中表现优异，但在高频、运行时问题中的应用仍有限。

Method: FarSight通过分离应用语义和运行时内存布局，使用离线训练的深度学习模型预测访问模式，结合异步推理、前瞻预测和缓存驻留模型，实现低开销高精度预取。

Result: 在四个数据密集型工作负载上，FarSight比现有最优远内存系统性能提升高达3.6倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了现代机器学习技术应用于复杂、性能关键型软件运行时问题的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Modern software systems face increasing runtime performance demands,
particularly in emerging architectures like far memory, where local-memory
misses incur significant latency. While machine learning (ML) has proven
effective in offline systems optimization, its application to high-frequency,
runtime-level problems remains limited due to strict performance,
generalization, and integration constraints. We present FarSight, a Linux-based
far-memory system that leverages deep learning (DL) to efficiently perform
accurate data prefetching. FarSight separates application semantics from
runtime memory layout, allowing offline-trained DL models to predict access
patterns using a compact vocabulary of ordinal possibilities, resolved at
runtime through lightweight mapping structures. By combining asynchronous
inference, lookahead prediction, and a cache-resident DL model, FarSight
achieves high prediction accuracy with low runtime overhead. Our evaluation of
FarSight on four data-intensive workloads shows that it outperforms the
state-of-the-art far-memory system by up to 3.6 times. Overall, this work
demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying modern ML techniques to
complex, performance-critical software runtime problems.

*Ni Mu,Hao Hu,Xiao Hu,Yiqin Yang,Bo Xu,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLARIFY方法通过对比学习解决PbRL中模糊反馈问题，提升查询区分度和轨迹嵌入效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于偏好的强化学习（PbRL）依赖人类偏好比较来推断奖励函数，但人类在相似片段间难以明确标注偏好，导致标签效率低下，限制了PbRL的实际应用。

Method: 提出离线PbRL方法CLARIFY，通过对比学习构建包含偏好信息的轨迹嵌入空间，使区分明确的片段间距更大，从而选择更明确的查询。

Result: 实验表明，CLARIFY在非理想教师和真实人类反馈设置中均优于基线方法，不仅能选择更易区分的查询，还能学习到有意义的轨迹嵌入。

Conclusion: CLARIFY通过解决模糊反馈问题，提升了PbRL的标签效率和实用性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses explicit reward
engineering by inferring reward functions from human preference comparisons,
enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, humans often struggle
to label a clear preference between similar segments, reducing label efficiency
and limiting PbRL's real-world applicability. To address this, we propose an
offline PbRL method: Contrastive LeArning for ResolvIng Ambiguous Feedback
(CLARIFY), which learns a trajectory embedding space that incorporates
preference information, ensuring clearly distinguished segments are spaced
apart, thus facilitating the selection of more unambiguous queries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CLARIFY outperforms baselines in both non-ideal
teachers and real human feedback settings. Our approach not only selects more
distinguished queries but also learns meaningful trajectory embeddings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADB的新框架，通过引入受控的统计多样性训练模型，发现更高的分布内偏差反而能提升分布外泛化性能，与传统最小化验证误差的做法相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在数据分布变化时性能下降，现有验证范式可能无法有效提升模型的分布外泛化能力。论文旨在探索偏差与泛化之间的新关系。

Method: 提出自适应分布桥接(ADB)框架，在训练中引入受控统计多样性，使模型形成有利于跨分布泛化的偏差模式。

Result: 实验显示分布内偏差与分布外误差呈负相关，ADB相比传统交叉验证最高降低26.8%误差，74.4%情况下能识别高性能训练策略。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了提升泛化的实用方法，还提出了重新思考偏差在鲁棒机器学习中作用的理论框架。

Abstract: Machine learning models often degrade when deployed on data distributions
different from their training data. Challenging conventional validation
paradigms, we demonstrate that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can lead to
better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our Adaptive Distribution
Bridge (ADB) framework implements this insight by introducing controlled
statistical diversity during training, enabling models to develop bias profiles
that effectively generalize across distributions. Empirically, we observe a
robust negative correlation where higher ID bias corresponds to lower OOD
error--a finding that contradicts standard practices focused on minimizing
validation error. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows our approach
significantly improves OOD generalization. ADB achieves robust mean error
reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation, and
consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, evidenced by
percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. Our work provides both a practical
method for improving generalization and a theoretical framework for
reconsidering the role of bias in robust machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据的高维性和稀疏性对现有聚类模型提出了挑战，需要更有效的聚类方法。

Method: JojoSCL结合了基于层次贝叶斯估计的收缩估计器，通过SURE优化实例级和集群级对比学习。

Result: 在十个单细胞RNA测序数据集上的实验表明，JojoSCL优于现有聚类方法，并通过鲁棒性分析和消融研究验证其实用性。

Conclusion: JojoSCL为单细胞RNA测序数据聚类提供了一种高效且可靠的新方法。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding
of cellular processes by enabling gene expression analysis at the individual
cell level. Clustering allows for the identification of cell types and the
further discovery of intrinsic patterns in single-cell data. However, the high
dimensionality and sparsity of scRNA-seq data continue to challenge existing
clustering models. In this paper, we introduce JojoSCL, a novel self-supervised
contrastive learning framework for scRNA-seq clustering. By incorporating a
shrinkage estimator based on hierarchical Bayesian estimation, which adjusts
gene expression estimates towards more reliable cluster centroids to reduce
intra-cluster dispersion, and optimized using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate
(SURE), JojoSCL refines both instance-level and cluster-level contrastive
learning. Experiments on ten scRNA-seq datasets substantiate that JojoSCL
consistently outperforms prevalent clustering methods, with further validation
of its practicality through robustness analysis and ablation studies. JojoSCL's

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has attracted increasing attention to mitigate
security and privacy challenges in traditional cloud-centric machine learning
models specifically in healthcare ecosystems. FL methodologies enable the
training of global models through localized policies, allowing independent
operations at the edge clients' level. Conventional first-order FL approaches
face several challenges in personalized model training due to heterogeneous
non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data of each edge client.
Recently, second-order FL approaches maintain the stability and consistency of
non-iid datasets while improving personalized model training. This study
proposes and develops a verifiable and auditable optimized second-order FL
framework BFEL (blockchain-enhanced federated edge learning) based on optimized
FedCurv for personalized healthcare systems. FedCurv incorporates information
about the importance of each parameter to each client's task (through Fisher
Information Matrix) which helps to preserve client-specific knowledge and
reduce model drift during aggregation. Moreover, it minimizes communication
rounds required to achieve a target precision convergence for each edge client
while effectively managing personalized training on non-iid and heterogeneous
data. The incorporation of Ethereum-based model aggregation ensures trust,
verifiability, and auditability while public key encryption enhances privacy
and security. Experimental results of federated CNNs and MLPs utilizing Mnist,
Cifar-10, and PathMnist demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the
proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑模型架构和两阶段训练策略的时空相关性检测模型MTAD-RD，用于解决WSN异常检测中的特征提取不足、样本标签缺失、样本不平衡等问题，并在真实数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSN数据中的异常检测对评估其可靠性和稳定性至关重要，但现有方法在时空特征提取、样本标签缺失、异常样本少和样本分布不平衡等方面存在挑战。

Method: MTAD-RD模型结合了增强的RetNet、多粒度特征融合模块和图注意力网络模块，采用两阶段训练策略：无监督对比学习代理任务和基于缓存的样本采样器，以及联合损失函数训练双图判别器网络。

Result: 在真实公开数据集上，MTAD-RD的F1分数达到90.97%，优于现有的监督WSN异常检测方法。

Conclusion: MTAD-RD模型通过创新的架构设计和训练策略，有效解决了WSN异常检测中的多个挑战，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial
evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods
for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction
of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few
anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these
issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both
model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed.
In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network
includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR)
module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network
module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can
integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN
neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data.
Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce
inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was
designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series
data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to
learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive
learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the
dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples
into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was
developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the
problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real
public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1
score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection
methods.

TL;DR: COGNATE框架利用通用硬件廉价样本训练成本模型，并通过少量样本微调适配新兴硬件，显著提升稀疏张量程序在加速器上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏张量程序在深度学习和图分析中至关重要，但针对早期硬件加速器的优化面临两大挑战：程序性能对稀疏输入变化敏感，且依赖昂贵的模拟器。传统基于ML的成本模型因需大量训练数据而失效。

Method: 提出COGNATE框架：先通过CPU等通用硬件获取廉价样本训练初始成本模型，再利用少量新兴硬件样本进行微调，利用硬件间特征同质性并缓解异质性影响。

Result: 实验表明COGNATE仅需5%的加速器专用数据量即可达到同等性能，在SpMM和SDDMM任务上平均加速分别达1.47倍（最高5.46倍）和1.39倍（最高4.22倍）。

Conclusion: COGNATE通过跨硬件迁移学习有效解决了早期加速器优化中的数据效率问题，为稀疏计算提供了实用的性能优化方案。

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics,
driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized
hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for
accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly
sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on
expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such
programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage
accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end,
we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples
from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by
few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of
input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating
heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples
needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing
techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and
1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

TL;DR: 本文提出TIDFormer，一种高效利用时间和交互动态的动态图Transformer，解决了现有Transformer-based DGNNs在动态图上定义不明确和效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的动态图神经网络（DGNNs）在捕捉动态图序列演化时效果和效率差异显著，缺乏对自注意力机制在动态图上可解释性的明确定义，且需要复杂模块来编码时间和交互动态。

Method: 提出TIDFormer，通过日历时间分区信息和一阶邻居采样提取交互嵌入，分别建模时间和交互动态，并通过简单分解联合建模两者特征。

Result: 实验表明，TIDFormer在多个动态图数据集上表现优异，优于现有最先进模型，且相比其他基于Transformer的方法具有显著的效率优势。

Conclusion: TIDFormer通过高效的时间和交互动态建模，解决了动态图上自注意力机制的可解释性和效率问题，为动态图神经网络提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the proficiency of self-attention mechanisms (SAMs) in capturing
dependencies in sequence modeling, several existing dynamic graph neural
networks (DGNNs) utilize Transformer architectures with various encoding
designs to capture sequential evolutions of dynamic graphs. However, the
effectiveness and efficiency of these Transformer-based DGNNs vary
significantly, highlighting the importance of properly defining the SAM on
dynamic graphs and comprehensively encoding temporal and interactive dynamics
without extra complex modules. In this work, we propose TIDFormer, a dynamic
graph TransFormer that fully exploits Temporal and Interactive Dynamics in an
efficient manner. We clarify and verify the interpretability of our proposed
SAM, addressing the open problem of its uninterpretable definitions on dynamic
graphs in previous works. To model the temporal and interactive dynamics,
respectively, we utilize the calendar-based time partitioning information and
extract informative interaction embeddings for both bipartite and non-bipartite
graphs using merely the sampled first-order neighbors. In addition, we jointly
model temporal and interactive features by capturing potential changes in
historical interaction patterns through a simple decomposition. We conduct
extensive experiments on several dynamic graph datasets to verify the
effectiveness and efficiency of TIDFormer. The experimental results demonstrate
that TIDFormer excels, outperforming state-of-the-art models across most
datasets and experimental settings. Furthermore, TIDFormer exhibits significant
efficiency advantages compared to previous Transformer-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列建模中缺乏通道可辨识性(CID)会导致忽略通道特异性，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出通道归一化(CN)策略，通过为每个通道分配独立仿射变换参数增强CID；扩展出自适应(ACN)和基于原型的(PCN)变体。

Result: 在多种时间序列模型上应用CN及其变体，均取得显著性能提升，并通过信息论分析验证有效性。

Conclusion: CN及其变体通过增强CID显著提升时间序列模型性能，尤其适用于通道数量未知或变化的场景。

Abstract: Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between
individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often
results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding
channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of
CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective
normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine
transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1)
Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS,
improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a
set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling
applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and
facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving
significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we
analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过正样本和无标签数据学习（PU学习）来识别目标营销中潜在客户的方法，旨在高效定位对产品有兴趣但公司忠诚度低的客户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业在营销中通常只能观察到已购买产品的客户，而决策者希望基于客户忠诚度进行有效营销。忠诚客户无需额外广告也会购买，而非忠诚客户可能忽略产品或选择竞品。因此，精准识别有兴趣但低忠诚的客户能提升营销效率。

Method: 提出“双重PU学习”算法，通过单阶段优化隐式结合两种PU学习损失函数，从有限数据中学习分类器，识别符合条件（有兴趣+低忠诚）的潜在客户。

Result: 数值实验验证了算法的有效性，证实其能准确解决目标问题。

Conclusion: 该方法通过聚焦“兴趣高-忠诚低”客户群体，实现了更高效的精准营销，且算法在实际场景中表现良好。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for identifying potential customers in
targeted marketing by applying learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU
learning). We consider a scenario in which a company sells a product and can
observe only the customers who purchased it. Decision-makers seek to market
products effectively based on whether people have loyalty to the company.
Individuals with loyalty are those who are likely to remain interested in the
company even without additional advertising. Consequently, those loyal
customers would likely purchase from the company if they are interested in the
product. In contrast, people with lower loyalty may overlook the product or buy
similar products from other companies unless they receive marketing attention.
Therefore, by focusing marketing efforts on individuals who are interested in
the product but do not have strong loyalty, we can achieve more efficient
marketing. To achieve this goal, we consider how to learn, from limited data, a
classifier that identifies potential customers who (i) have interest in the
product and (ii) do not have loyalty to the company. Although our algorithm
comprises a single-stage optimization, its objective function implicitly
contains two losses derived from standard PU learning settings. For this
reason, we refer to our approach as double PU learning. We verify the validity
of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments, confirming that it
functions appropriately for the problem at hand.

Motivation: 由于图神经网络（GNNs）的黑盒特性，用户需要可解释性来理解模型行为并从中提取有价值的信息。然而，现有的实例级解释方法在分布外或未知测试数据上的可靠性存疑，因此需要一种能评估解释可靠性的方法。

Method: 论文提出了ConfExplainer框架，基于带置信度约束的广义图信息瓶颈（GIB-CC）理论，通过置信度评分模块量化生成解释的可靠性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法，置信度评分有效提升了解释的可信度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ConfExplainer通过理论驱动的置信度评分，显著提高了GNN解释的可靠性，为实际应用提供了更可信的解释工具。

Abstract: Explaining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has garnered significant attention
due to the need for interpretability, enabling users to understand the behavior
of these black-box models better and extract valuable insights from their
predictions. While numerous post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have
been proposed to interpret GNN predictions, the reliability of these
explanations remains uncertain, particularly in the out-of-distribution or
unknown test datasets. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing
an explainer framework with the confidence scoring module ( ConfExplainer),
grounded in theoretical principle, which is generalized graph information
bottleneck with confidence constraint (GIB-CC), that quantifies the reliability
of generated explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, highlighting the effectiveness of the confidence score in
enhancing the trustworthiness and robustness of GNN explanations.

Result: 在Xilinx ZCU104开发板上，加速器比ARM Cortex-A53 CPU快4.9倍，推理速度提升3.7倍，能效提高3.5倍，同时在分类任务中保持与前沿模型相当的精度。

Conclusion: PointODE-Elite在精度与推理成本之间取得了显著平衡，为嵌入式设备上的点云处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Embedded edge devices are often used as a computing platform to run
real-world point cloud applications, but recent deep learning-based methods may
not fit on such devices due to limited resources. In this paper, we aim to fill
this gap by introducing PointODE, a parameter-efficient ResNet-like
architecture for point cloud feature extraction based on a stack of MLP blocks
with residual connections. We leverage Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential
Equation), a continuous-depth version of ResNet originally developed for
modeling the dynamics of continuous-time systems, to compress PointODE by
reusing the same parameters across MLP blocks. The point-wise normalization is
proposed for PointODE to handle the non-uniform distribution of feature points.
We introduce PointODE-Elite as a lightweight version with 0.58M trainable
parameters and design its dedicated accelerator for embedded FPGAs. The
accelerator consists of a four-stage pipeline to parallelize the feature
extraction for multiple points and stores the entire parameters on-chip to
eliminate most of the off-chip data transfers. Compared to the ARM Cortex-A53
CPU, the accelerator implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104 board speeds up the feature
extraction by 4.9x, leading to 3.7x faster inference and 3.5x better
energy-efficiency. Despite the simple architecture, PointODE-Elite shows
competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art models on both synthetic and
real-world classification datasets, greatly improving the trade-off between
accuracy and inference cost.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型集成方法采用固定权重策略，无法适应模型能力的动态变化和上下文依赖特性。

Method: 将集成问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用单/多智能体强化学习算法动态调整权重。

Result: 在多样化任务上准确率最高提升3.3%，且具备跨任务泛化能力和更低延迟。

Conclusion: RLAE为LLM集成提供了更有效的框架，无需重新训练即可适应不同任务。

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse
strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance
performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on
fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent
characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement
Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates
LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach
introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering
both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being
trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs.
We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement
learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ),
demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods.
Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms
existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective
framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior
generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for
retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

Result: 在多种数据类型上验证，PSI-PFL将全局模型准确率最高提升10%，同时保障本地模型公平性。

Conclusion: PSI-PFL有效缓解了标签偏移问题，为注重数据隐私和异构性的联邦学习应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning (ML) model
training while preserving data privacy by keeping data localized across
clients. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data
across clients poses a significant challenge, leading to skewed model updates
and performance degradation. Addressing this, we propose PSI-PFL, a novel
client selection framework for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) that
leverages the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify and mitigate data
heterogeneity (so-called non-IIDness). Our approach selects more homogeneous
clients based on PSI, reducing the impact of label skew, one of the most
detrimental factors in FL performance. Experimental results over multiple data
modalities (tabular, image, text) demonstrate that PSI-PFL significantly
improves global model accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up
to 10\% under non-IID scenarios while ensuring fairer local performance.
PSI-PFL enhances FL performance and offers practical benefits in applications
where data privacy and heterogeneity are critical.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional
graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies.
Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by
developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models.
However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight
update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order
topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker
Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent
homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence,
to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas,
we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on
dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order
topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across
snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's
state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its
high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis. Our code is

### [373] [Revisiting LLMs as Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasters: Small Noise Can Break Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00457)
*Junwoo Park,Hyuck Lee,Dohyun Lee,Daehoon Gwak,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本时间序列预测中的表现，发现其对噪声敏感且准确性不足，建议通过微调改进数值序列处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种任务中表现出色，但其在时间序列预测中的零样本能力存在争议，需要严谨验证以明确其实际效果。

Method: 通过实验比较LLMs与领域专用模型在零样本预测中的表现，并探索降低LLMs对噪声敏感性的方法。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在零样本预测中因对噪声敏感而表现不佳，甚至不如简单的领域专用模型。

Conclusion: 论文建议未来研究方向应聚焦于通过微调LLMs提升其处理数值序列的能力，而非强调零样本预测。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse
tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for
time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot
forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack
inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a
rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared
to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based
zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their
sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We
have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot
setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our
findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more
promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process
numerical sequences. Our experimental code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hanabi作为不完全信息合作游戏，对强化学习智能体提出了挑战，研究旨在探索不同算法在此环境下的表现差异。

Method: 对比了表格型与深度强化学习算法，包括Expected SARSA和深度Q学习，分析它们在不同对手下的表现。

Result: 时序差分算法（如Expected SARSA和深度Q学习）在整体性能和玩法平衡上优于表格型算法，且某些智能体会针对特定对手调整策略。

Conclusion: 时序差分算法在Hanabi游戏中展现出更优的综合性能，尤其是表格型Expected SARSA和深度Q学习智能体表现最佳。

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement
learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have
incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for
a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning
algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the
same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain
agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others
exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's
behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm
provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions
between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal
difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play
types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep
Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

Abstract: We aim to better understand the tradeoffs between traditional and
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for energy storage management. More
specifically, we wish to better understand the performance loss incurred when
using a generative RL policy instead of using a traditional approach to find
optimal control policies for specific instances. Our comparison is based on a
simplified micro-grid model, that includes a load component, a photovoltaic
source, and a storage device. Based on this model, we examine three use cases
of increasing complexity: ideal storage with convex cost functions, lossy
storage devices, and lossy storage devices with convex transmission losses.
With the aim of promoting the principled use RL based methods in this
challenging and important domain, we provide a detailed formulation of each use
case and a detailed description of the optimization challenges. We then compare
the performance of traditional and RL methods, discuss settings in which it is
beneficial to use each method, and suggest avenues for future investigation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SST的新型半监督学习框架，通过自适应的阈值调整机制（SAT）高效选择高质量伪标签，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中获取高质量标注数据成本高昂，现有半监督学习方法依赖固定阈值选择伪标签，存在效率低和计算资源消耗大的问题。

Method: 提出SST框架，引入自适应的SAT机制，根据模型学习进度动态调整类别特定阈值，确保选择高质量伪标签数据。

Result: SST在多种架构和数据集上实现了最先进的性能，Semi-SST-ViT-Huge在ImageNet-1K上仅用10%标注数据即达到84.9%的Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: SST通过自适应阈值机制有效解决了伪标签选择问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，展示了半监督学习的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised
learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However,
obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent
studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency
regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements.
However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting
sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed
thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced
flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL
research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration
is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially
unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with
Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL
framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the
model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and
confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves
state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and
scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge
achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7%
/ 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the
fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using
100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10%
labeled data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ModelNet，一个基于预训练ResNet50模型嵌入构建的新型图像分类数据集，用于模拟真实的联邦学习环境，并通过三种数据异构性变体（同质、异质、随机）来评估联邦学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分布式数据源上训练模型时面临数据隐私和领域异构性评估的挑战。现有基准测试缺乏对客户端特定数据分布和领域异构性的考虑，限制了FL算法的严格评估。

Method: 论文通过修改CIFAR100数据集，构建了三种客户端特定的数据变体（ModelNet-S、ModelNet-D、ModelNet-R），分别对应同质、异质和随机数据设置。此外，提出了一种新的假设，允许FL算法访问匿名化模型参数以更好地保护本地隐私。

Result: 实验表明，ModelNet在领域偏移和聚合策略下表现出色，成为传统和图驱动FL研究的实用基准。数据集和代码已公开。

Conclusion: ModelNet通过模拟真实FL环境中的非独立同分布数据分布和客户端多样性，为FL研究提供了有效的评估工具，并首次提出了跨环境客户端特定的FL数据集及图驱动变体。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training
machine learning models across distributed data sources while preserving data
locality. However, the privacy of local data is always a pivotal concern and
has received a lot of attention in recent research on the FL regime. Moreover,
the lack of domain heterogeneity and client-specific segregation in the
benchmarks remains a critical bottleneck for rigorous evaluation. In this
paper, we introduce ModelNet, a novel image classification dataset constructed
from the embeddings extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 model. First, we
modify the CIFAR100 dataset into three client-specific variants, considering
three domain heterogeneities (homogeneous, heterogeneous, and random).
Subsequently, we train each client-specific subset of all three variants on the
pre-trained ResNet50 model to save model parameters. In addition to
multi-domain image data, we propose a new hypothesis to define the FL algorithm
that can access the anonymized model parameters to preserve the local privacy
in a more effective manner compared to existing ones. ModelNet is designed to
simulate realistic FL settings by incorporating non-IID data distributions and
client diversity design principles in the mainframe for both conventional and
futuristic graph-driven FL algorithms. The three variants are ModelNet-S,
ModelNet-D, and ModelNet-R, which are based on homogeneous, heterogeneous, and
random data settings, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to propose a cross-environment client-specific FL dataset along with the
graph-based variant. Extensive experiments based on domain shifts and
aggregation strategies show the effectiveness of the above variants, making it
a practical benchmark for classical and graph-based FL research. The dataset
and related code are available online.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flashback Learning (FL) 是一种新颖的持续学习方法，通过双向正则化平衡模型的可塑性与稳定性，提升新旧知识的学习与保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注通过正则化模型更新来保留旧知识，但缺乏对可塑性与稳定性之间平衡的明确处理。FL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FL采用两阶段训练过程，利用两个独立的知识库分别增强可塑性和稳定性，通过双向正则化机制平衡模型更新。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FL将类别增量学习和任务增量学习的平均准确率分别提升4.91%和3.51%，并在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FL通过显式平衡可塑性与稳定性，显著提升了持续学习性能，且易于与多种现有方法集成。

Abstract: We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize
the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior
approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old
information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off
through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively
guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining
its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be
seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter
regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing
FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another
to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both
knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the
FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL
demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same
training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline
from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to
4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard
image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the
stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this
balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging
datasets like ImageNet.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DDA-PIGCN的新方法，通过结合时空特征的图卷积网络，解决了AC-OPF求解器在约束建模和知识表示方面的局限性，并在多个IEEE标准测试案例中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AC-OPF求解器在约束空间和最优解之间的复杂关系建模上存在不足，且仅基于空间拓扑的电网建模限制了额外先验知识（如时间信息）的整合。

Method: DDA-PIGCN方法通过多层硬物理约束优化长距离依赖特征，采用动态域适应学习机制迭代更新关键状态变量，并利用电网物理结构捕捉时空依赖关系。

Result: 在多个IEEE标准测试案例中，DDA-PIGCN的平均绝对误差（MAE）介于0.0011至0.0624之间，约束满足率在99.6%至100%之间。

Conclusion: DDA-PIGCN作为一种可靠且高效的AC-OPF求解器，通过结合时空特征和动态域适应机制，显著提升了约束建模和知识表示的能力。

Abstract: Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator
power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage
magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers
struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable
distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal
solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's
ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling
the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration
of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these
challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven
Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address
constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that
incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency
optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying
multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain
adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state
variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint
verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between
generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid,
allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space.
Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong
performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and
case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and
constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a
reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

Conclusion: BenchHub能够促进更好的数据集重用、更透明的模型比较，并更容易识别现有基准中代表性不足的领域，为推进LLM评估研究提供了关键基础设施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date
and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many
existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging
to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the
growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In
this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers
researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub
aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse
domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to
support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and
customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through
extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model
performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing
the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage
better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier
identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a
critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型(LLM)研究进展迅速，但模型参数的统计分布及其对训练和推理效率的影响尚未得到充分关注。现有工作BackSlash发现预训练参数服从GG分布，但缺乏系统性优化方案。

Method: 1) 基于GG分布的初始化方案；2) 训练后正则化方法DeepShape调整权重分布；3) 专为GG分布设计的8位浮点格式RF8。三者构成端到端优化框架。

Conclusion: 通过统计建模指导LLM开发，该工作为高效、可扩展且硬件友好的AI系统开辟了新路径。代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language
models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as
their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream
efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work
introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first
demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian
distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash
can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on
this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM
optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of
trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2)
DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight
distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized
degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit
floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash
training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy.
Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework
consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard
training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical
modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and
hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page:

TL;DR: FLoE提出了一种新的参数高效微调框架，通过动态识别关键层和自动优化LoRA秩，显著提升了大型语言模型在下游任务中的适应效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法通常在所有层中均匀部署LoRA适配器，忽略了层的异质性和任务特定的秩需求，导致参数冗余和效率低下。FLoE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FLoE引入了两个关键创新：基于Fisher信息的重要性评分机制动态识别关键层，以及基于贝叶斯优化的秩分配器自动确定最优LoRA秩。

Result: 实验表明，FLoE在多样化的LLM和基准测试中实现了高效的准确性与效率平衡，特别适合资源受限的环境。

Conclusion: FLoE通过稀疏适配器部署和自动秩优化，显著提升了PEFT的效率和性能，为资源受限场景下的快速适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely
adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs.
However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across
all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and
task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant
parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key
innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to
dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank
adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian
optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA
ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive
experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves
impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly
advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 飞机发动机等复杂系统的预测性维护需要大量运行至故障的数据样本，但由于隐私问题，航空公司不愿共享数据。此外，传感器数据通常存在噪声和质量问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种协作联邦学习框架，包括去中心化验证程序和四种新颖的全局模型参数聚合方法，以增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，联邦学习框架在六家航空公司中的五家实现了更准确的RUL预测，且新型聚合方法有效提升了框架对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架在不共享数据的情况下，显著提升了RUL预测的准确性，并能够有效应对噪声数据问题。

Abstract: Complex systems such as aircraft engines are continuously monitored by
sensors. In predictive aircraft maintenance, the collected sensor measurements
are used to estimate the health condition and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
of such systems. However, a major challenge when developing prognostics is the
limited number of run-to-failure data samples. This challenge could be overcome
if multiple airlines would share their run-to-failure data samples such that
sufficient learning can be achieved. Due to privacy concerns, however, airlines
are reluctant to share their data in a centralized setting. In this paper, a
collaborative federated learning framework is therefore developed instead.
Here, several airlines cooperate to train a collective RUL prognostic machine
learning model, without the need to centrally share their data. For this, a
decentralized validation procedure is proposed to validate the prognostics
model without sharing any data. Moreover, sensor data is often noisy and of low
quality. This paper therefore proposes four novel methods to aggregate the
parameters of the global prognostic model. These methods enhance the robustness
of the FL framework against noisy data. The proposed framework is illustrated
for training a collaborative RUL prognostic model for aircraft engines, using
the N-CMAPSS dataset. Here, six airlines are considered, that collaborate in
the FL framework to train a collective RUL prognostic model for their
aircraft's engines. When comparing the proposed FL framework with the case
where each airline independently develops their own prognostic model, the
results show that FL leads to more accurate RUL prognostics for five out of the
six airlines. Moreover, the novel robust aggregation methods render the FL
framework robust to noisy data samples.

Conclusion: TD3-BC展示了在实时自动化治理中的潜力，为DeFi借贷利率优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending enables permissionless borrowing via
smart contracts. However, it faces challenges in optimizing interest rates,
mitigating bad debt, and improving capital efficiency. Rule-based interest-rate
models struggle to adapt to dynamic market conditions, leading to
inefficiencies. This work applies Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize interest rate adjustments in DeFi lending protocols. Using historical
data from Aave protocol, we evaluate three RL approaches: Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), Behavior Cloning (BC), and TD3 with Behavior Cloning
(TD3-BC). TD3-BC demonstrates superior performance in balancing utilization,
capital stability, and risk, outperforming existing models. It adapts
effectively to historical stress events like the May 2021 crash and the March
2023 USDC depeg, showcasing potential for automated, real-time governance.

Conclusion: 极端量化方法在空间和计算效率上表现优异，同时保持了高精度的相似性度量，为高维向量处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many modern search domains comprise high-dimensional vectors of floating
point numbers derived from neural networks, in the form of embeddings. Typical
embeddings range in size from hundreds to thousands of dimensions, making the
size of the embeddings, and the speed of comparison, a significant issue.
  Quantisation is a class of mechanism which replaces the floating point values
with a smaller representation, for example a short integer. This gives an
approximation of the embedding space in return for a smaller data
representation and a faster comparison function.
  Here we take this idea almost to its extreme: we show how vectors of
arbitrary-precision floating point values can be replaced by vectors whose
elements are drawn from the set {-1,0,1}. This yields very significant savings
in space and metric evaluation cost, while maintaining a strong correlation for
similarity measurements.
  This is achieved by way of a class of convex polytopes which exist in the
high-dimensional space. In this article we give an outline description of these
objects, and show how they can be used for the basis of such radical
quantisation while maintaining a surprising degree of accuracy.

Abstract: The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate
ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize
resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that
leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind
power output at granular time intervals. M2WLLM overcomes the limitations of
traditional and deep learning methods by seamlessly integrating textual
information and temporal numerical data, significantly improving wind power
forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a
Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual
prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter
within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs
can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction
accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three
Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing
methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The
results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in
ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning
capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的重缩放图卷积网络（RsGCN）和Re2Opt后搜索算法，用于解决神经旅行商问题（TSP）求解器的泛化能力差和训练成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经TSP求解器面临两个关键挑战：可扩展TSP的泛化能力差和训练成本高。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了RsGCN和Re2Opt算法。

Method: RsGCN通过重缩放机制增强泛化能力：（1）重缩放相邻节点以构建具有统一相邻节点数量的子图；（2）重缩放子图边以调整边长为相同量级。此外，RsGCN采用混合尺度数据集和双向损失的高效训练策略。Re2Opt算法则利用自适应权重重构过程避免局部最优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在9种不同规模的均匀分布实例（20到10K节点）和78个TSPLIB真实实例上表现出最先进的性能，同时需要最少的可学习参数和训练轮次。

Conclusion: 结合RsGCN和Re2Opt的求解器在泛化能力和训练成本方面表现优异，仅需3轮训练即可成功泛化到10K节点实例，无需微调。

Abstract: Neural traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges:
poor generalization for scalable TSPs and high training costs. To address these
challenges, we propose a new Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN).
Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem
scales) related to nodes and edges that influence the sensitivity of GCNs to
the problem scales, a Rescaling Mechanism in RsGCN enhances the generalization
capability by (1) rescaling adjacent nodes to construct a subgraph with a
uniform number of adjacent nodes for each node across various scales of TSPs,
which stabilizes the graph message aggregation; (2) rescaling subgraph edges to
adjust the lengths of subgraph edges to the same magnitude, which maintains
numerical consistency. In addition, an efficient training strategy with a
mixed-scale dataset and bidirectional loss is used in RsGCN. To fully exploit
the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design an efficient post-search algorithm
termed Re2Opt, in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is
incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of
RsGCN and Re2Opt, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low
training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on the mixed-scale dataset
containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully
to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across uniform distribution
instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world
instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and
training epochs among neural competitors.

Abstract: Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical
sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which
often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the
analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel
imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks
for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention
mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a
custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement
sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172
Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant
improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with
respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values
for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean
relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's
frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when
large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution
for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of
smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative
disorders.

Result: 在五个医疗VQA基准测试中平均性能提升18.4%，超越开源和商用模型，并展现类人推理模式。

Conclusion: MMedAgent-RL通过动态多智能体协作显著提升跨专科诊断能力，为医疗AI系统设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential
in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle
to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance.
Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by
clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact
in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack
flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose
MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that
enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we
train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to
assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician
integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make
final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we
introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively
teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and
correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and
proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns.
Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised
fine-tuning baselines.

Conclusion: 论文为深度强化学习中的度量学习提供了系统评估框架，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics
(notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these
learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness
to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these
metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps
between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns,
leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains
unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep
reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified
conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark
them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning
370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we
introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's
ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric
learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in
which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release
an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future
research on metric learning in deep RL.

Result: AMA在多项多任务对齐实验中表现优于标准对齐方法和模型合并方法。

Conclusion: AMA提供了一种理论支持的自适应数据混合方法，有效提升了多任务性能，为LLM对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance on various
tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) depends heavily on the
composition of their training data. However, selecting a data mixture that
achieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing
approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but
these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in
the setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign
(AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during
training to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains
\textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to
strong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel
minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses
deviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose
two algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to
prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is
sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a
convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence
result follows from Sagawa et al. (2019), and we provide a convergence proof
for AMA-S using online learning techniques such as EXP3. We evaluate AMA on
several multitask alignment setups and find that AMA outperforms the standard
alignment approach -- which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks --
and also outperforms model merging methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NEMOT的新计算框架，通过神经网络和迷你批次训练显著提升了多边际最优传输（MOT）的可扩展性，解决了传统Sinkhorn算法计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多边际最优传输（MOT）在建模多分布交互方面具有强大能力，但其计算复杂度随数据集规模呈指数级增长（O(n^k)），限制了其在机器学习中的实际应用。

Method: NEMOT框架利用神经网络和迷你批次训练，将计算复杂度从数据集规模转移到迷你批次规模，从而大幅提升计算效率。

Result: NEMOT在非渐近误差边界下提供了准确性保证，并通过数值实验展示了相对于Sinkhorn算法的数量级加速，同时支持更多样本和边际的可行计算。

Conclusion: NEMOT作为一种模块化解决方案，能够无缝集成到大规模机器学习流程中，显著扩展了熵正则化MOT在多边际数据任务中的实际应用范围。

Abstract: Multimarginal optimal transport (MOT) is a powerful framework for modeling
interactions between multiple distributions, yet its applicability is
bottlenecked by a high computational overhead. Entropic regularization provides
computational speedups via the multimarginal Sinkhorn algorithm, whose time
complexity, for a dataset size $n$ and $k$ marginals, generally scales as
$O(n^k)$. However, this dependence on the dataset size $n$ is computationally
prohibitive for many machine learning problems. In this work, we propose a new
computational framework for entropic MOT, dubbed Neural Entropic MOT (NEMOT),
that enjoys significantly improved scalability. NEMOT employs neural networks
trained using mini-batches, which transfers the computational complexity from
the dataset size to the size of the mini-batch, leading to substantial gains.
We provide formal guarantees on the accuracy of NEMOT via non-asymptotic error
bounds. We supplement these with numerical results that demonstrate the
performance gains of NEMOT over Sinkhorn's algorithm, as well as extensions to
neural computation of multimarginal entropic Gromov-Wasserstein alignment. In
particular, orders-of-magnitude speedups are observed relative to the
state-of-the-art, with a notable increase in the feasible number of samples and
marginals. NEMOT seamlessly integrates as a module in large-scale machine
learning pipelines, and can serve to expand the practical applicability of
entropic MOT for tasks involving multimarginal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代无线网络需适应动态条件并高效管理多样化服务需求，传统DRL在处理分散且演变的反馈时面临挑战。LLM能够将无序的网络反馈结构化，帮助RL代理更有效地识别模式。

Method: 引入基于情境化的适应方法，将可学习提示集成到LLM增强的DRL框架中，通过任务特定提示动态调整网络状态表示，避免全模型微调。

Conclusion: 通过提示增强学习，PA-MRL框架实现了更快、更可扩展和自适应的资源分配，适用于动态无线网络环境。

Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently
managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes
optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent
representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For
example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are
semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more
interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a
contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts
into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model
fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that
dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained
on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL)
framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL
objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations
and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our
approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in
O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and
outperforms other baselines.

Result: 实验表明ORAN-GUIDE在样本效率、策略收敛和性能泛化上优于标准MARL及单LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该框架通过语义增强的状态表示有效提升了O-RAN环境下的智能控制能力。

Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous
service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this
flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU),
that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource
allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input
like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder
policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and
evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a
dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant,
semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a
domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and
configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These
prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based
encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This
design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored
for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show
that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance
generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Method: 采用变分推理方法，将SFA的慢目标重新解释为重构损失的正则化项，同时保留信息性约束的核心思想。

Result: 该方法虽未完全等价于非线性SFA，但成功将慢目标纳入变分框架，为重构损失赋予了约束条件的角色。

Conclusion: 研究为SFA提供了新的概率视角，并指出了未来可能的研究方向，包括进一步探索非线性扩展和应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a novel probabilistic interpretation of Slow Feature
Analysis (SFA) through the lens of variational inference. Unlike prior
formulations that recover linear SFA from Gaussian state-space models with
linear emissions, this approach relaxes the key constraint of linearity. While
it does not lead to full equivalence to non-linear SFA, it recasts the
classical slowness objective in a variational framework. Specifically, it
allows the slowness objective to be interpreted as a regularizer to a
reconstruction loss. Furthermore, we provide arguments, why -- from the
perspective of slowness optimization -- the reconstruction loss takes on the
role of the constraints that ensure informativeness in SFA. We conclude with a
discussion of potential new research directions.

Abstract: Stress significantly contributes to both mental and physical disorders, yet
traditional self-reported questionnaires are inherently subjective. In this

to detect stress from raw EEG recordings. Our approach constructs graphs by
integrating structural connectivity (derived from electrode spatial
arrangement) with functional connectivity from pairwise signal correlations. A
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) processes these graphs to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics. Experiments on the SAM-40 dataset show
that the ST-GCN outperforms standard machine learning models on all key

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses
temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a
recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are
generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past
experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its
immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic
environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network
based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing
temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled
synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural
network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when
facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while
preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning
efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study
using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural
abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early
proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer
across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer
learning.

Result: 实验表明，减少churn有助于防止秩崩溃并提升学习性能，C-CHAIN方法在多个基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过减少churn可以有效防止塑性丧失，C-CHAIN方法在持续学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments,
or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study
the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network
output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We
demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation
of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step
size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn
Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning
performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning
environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and

from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for
anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and
overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning
(GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process
through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using
evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph
uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly
scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise
and structural perturbations.

Abstract: Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for
efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a
timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware
compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication
cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea
involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture
underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate
reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data
assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed
framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels.
Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly
considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong
compatibility with diverse predictors.

Abstract: Model Reprogramming (MR) is a resource-efficient framework that adapts large
pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal additional parameters and data,
offering a promising solution to the challenges of training large models for
diverse tasks. Despite its empirical success across various domains such as
computer vision and time-series forecasting, the theoretical foundations of MR
remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of MR through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework.
We demonstrate that the success of MR is governed by the eigenvalue spectrum of
the NTK matrix on the target dataset and establish the critical role of the
source model's effectiveness in determining reprogramming outcomes. Our
contributions include a novel theoretical framework for MR, insights into the
relationship between source and target models, and extensive experiments

Motivation: 建筑能源系统的决策高度依赖于时间序列模型的预测准确性。在缺乏目标建筑大量数据的情况下，基础模型（FMs）能够利用预训练数据集中的先验知识构建准确的概率预测器，从而支持决策工具。

Method: 论文分析了完全微调和参数高效微调（特别是低秩适应LoRA）两种方法，使用商业净零能耗建筑的真实数据（如房间占用率、碳排放、插电负载和HVAC能耗）进行实验。

Result: TSFMs的零样本预测性能通常不理想，但通过微调（尤其是LoRA）能显著提升准确性，且计算成本大幅降低。微调后的TSFMs在准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力上均优于现有深度预测模型。

Conclusion: TSFMs在数据受限的建筑能源管理系统中具有实际应用价值，能够通过改进决策支持能源效率和可持续性目标。

Abstract: Decision-making in building energy systems critically depends on the
predictive accuracy of relevant time-series models. In scenarios lacking
extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a
promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse
pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in
decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and
fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building
energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using
real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals
such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy
consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of
TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that
employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning
significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data.
Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces
computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs
consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g.,
temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization
across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline
the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy
management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy
efficiency and sustainability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的信号异常、噪声和分布偏移给时空预测带来挑战，现有解决方案计算量大且资源需求高，亟需高效且通用的方法。

Method: 引入频谱域校准器进行相位-幅度调制以缓解周期性偏移，并提出基于流式内存队列的快速更新机制，实现高效的测试时计算。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有高效性、通用性、灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: ST-TTC无需复杂训练阶段技术，提供了一种高效且可泛化的时空预测新范式。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as
transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios
frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and
distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by
modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these
approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for
large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing
paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal
forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic
structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and
perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy.
Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with
phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash
updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time
computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques,
offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility
and efficiency of our proposed method.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved substantial success across various

conditions under which neural networks can effectively approximate matrix
inverses. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental results from
diverse matrix datasets, exploring the efficacy of neural networks in

Result: 实验证明仿射映射能有效保持控制向量的语义效果，表明小模型表示可迁移指导大模型行为。

Conclusion: LRT假设为理解跨模型规模的表示对齐提供了新方向，小模型表示对大模型具有实际指导价值。

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures
trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning
task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where
representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed
as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis
features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,
regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear
Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine
transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test
this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models
of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in
hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their
semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the
learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings
can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations
learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and
that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding
representation alignment across model scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内定位面临信号稀疏、无序且长度可变等挑战，传统方法难以有效处理。本文旨在开发一种能自然适应信号特性的神经网络模型。

Method: 将Wi-Fi扫描数据建模为(BSSID, RSSI)无序集合，使用嵌入向量表示BSSID并与信号强度拼接，通过集合变换器学习基于注意力的接入点关系表征。

Result: 在六栋校园建筑的测试中，LSTM平均误差低至2.23米（最优），集合变换器稳居第二，尤其在跨楼宇(E2)和跨楼层(E3)任务中显著优于MLP/RNN等基线模型。

Conclusion: 基于集合的神经网络能有效处理现实定位任务中的稀疏无序信号，集合变换器为多域环境下的鲁棒定位提供了理论框架。

Abstract: We propose a permutation-invariant neural architecture for indoor
localization using RSSI scans from Wi-Fi access points. Each scan is modeled as
an unordered set of (BSSID, RSSI) pairs, where BSSIDs are mapped to learned
embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set
Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while
learning attention-based representations over access point relationships. We
evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment
consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers
fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically
distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed
all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three
tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer
performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming
the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving
multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in
E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting
the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work
demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based
localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered
inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

Motivation: 随着临床模型对数据的依赖性增强，如何在保护患者敏感数据的同时平衡模型性能和公平性成为关键挑战。

Method: 通过结构化检索策略，筛选了截至2025年3月的74项研究，涵盖不同数据模态、训练设置和下游任务，重点分析了DP-SGD及其他机制在集中式和联邦式设置中的应用。

Result: 研究发现，强隐私预算下DP在结构化成像任务中能保持性能，但在严格隐私条件下性能下降明显，尤其是对少数群体或复杂模态；隐私导致的性能差距对不同人口亚群影响不均，且公平性影响因数据类型和任务而异。

Conclusion: 论文总结了公平性审计、标准化和评估协议方面的关键缺口，为未来开发公平且临床稳健的隐私保护深度学习系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient
data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more
data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a
critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in
applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative
mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search
strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis
spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and
highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and
subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy
budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe
degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented
or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps
disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying
by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these
tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them
entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms,
generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains
inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing,
standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work
toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in
medicine.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly.
However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in
diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat
settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness
across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and
toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a
diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment
analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction
tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables
integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage
immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii)
provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and
utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins,
SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime,
defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We
showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied
poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics,
SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and
comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning. Code is available at:

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large
language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often
shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work,
we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key
limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some
evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially
masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing.
Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across
tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines.
Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making
their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues
suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate
unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future
unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task
awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted
experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant
computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build
upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a
novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained
permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model
demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches,
we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process
further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear
transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a
new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the
representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to
encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without
compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant
improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear
attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Conclusion: C3PO通过中心路径引导的策略更新，有效提升了约束策略优化的性能，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In constrained Markov decision processes, enforcing constraints during
training is often thought of as decreasing the final return. Recently, it was
shown that constraints can be incorporated directly in the policy geometry,
yielding an optimization trajectory close to the central path of a barrier
method, which does not compromise final return. Building on this idea, we
introduce Central Path Proximal Policy Optimization (C3PO), a simple
modification of PPO that produces policy iterates, which stay close to the
central path of the constrained optimization problem. Compared to existing
on-policy methods, C3PO delivers improved performance with tighter constraint
enforcement, suggesting that central path-guided updates offer a promising
direction for constrained policy optimization.

Abstract: Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training
data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed
through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require
access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models.
This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian
inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such
as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset
statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior
probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training.
Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's
effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond
membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering
a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

Conclusion: RelDiff通过分解结构和属性，确保高保真和引用完整性，为关系数据库生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world databases are predominantly relational, comprising multiple
interlinked tables that contain complex structural and statistical
dependencies. Learning generative models on relational data has shown great
promise in generating synthetic data and imputing missing values. However,
existing methods often struggle to capture this complexity, typically reducing
relational data to conditionally generated flat tables and imposing limiting
structural assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce RelDiff, a
novel diffusion generative model that synthesizes complete relational databases
by explicitly modeling their foreign key graph structure. RelDiff combines a
joint graph-conditioned diffusion process across all tables for attribute
synthesis, and a $2K+$SBM graph generator based on the Stochastic Block Model
for structure generation. The decomposition of graph structure and relational
attributes ensures both high fidelity and referential integrity, both of which
are crucial aspects of synthetic relational database generation. Experiments on
11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that RelDiff consistently outperforms prior
methods in producing realistic and coherent synthetic relational databases.

normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty,
mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions.
Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains,

*Daniel Paleka,Shashwat Goel,Jonas Geiping,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文指出评估大语言模型（LLM）在预测任务中的表现存在挑战，需更严谨的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有研究声称LLM预测能力媲美或超越人类的现象，作者认为评估方法存在缺陷，需警惕结论的可信度。

Method: 通过系统性分析和前人研究案例，识别时间泄漏和现实外推困难两类评估问题。

Result: 研究表明当前评估方法可能导致性能高估，无法真实反映LLM的预测能力。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的评估方法才能可靠判断LLM的预测能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks,
with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In
this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such
conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We
identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation
results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in
extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through
systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how
evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance
claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to
confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于压缩的方法，用于在训练多射击神经常微分方程（MS-NODE）时结合射击等式约束，提高了稳定性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多射击方法在常微分方程参数估计中具有稳定性优势，但在神经ODE中应用较少，主要因为难以结合一般等式约束。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于压缩的方法，结合射击等式约束，使用一阶优化方法（如Adam）训练MS-NODE。

Result: 该方法成功地将射击等式约束纳入MS-NODE训练，提高了对高度振荡和长轨迹的稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了神经ODE中多射击应用的挑战，为复杂轨迹的参数估计提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-shooting is a parameter estimation approach for ordinary
differential equations. In this approach, the trajectory is broken into small
intervals, each of which can be integrated independently. Equality constraints
are then applied to eliminate the shooting gap between the end of the previous
trajectory and the start of the next trajectory. Unlike single-shooting,
multiple-shooting is more stable, especially for highly oscillatory and long
trajectories. In the context of neural ordinary differential equations,
multiple-shooting is not widely used due to the challenge of incorporating
general equality constraints. In this work, we propose a condensing-based
approach to incorporate these shooting equality constraints while training a
multiple-shooting neural ordinary differential equation (MS-NODE) using
first-order optimization methods such as Adam.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的新方法，用于医学图像中的平面重新格式化任务，特别是在4D流MRI中。该方法通过灵活的坐标系和A3C算法，提高了准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的DRL方法在平面重新格式化任务中表现良好，但要求测试数据与训练数据的位置和方向一致。这限制了其在多样化医学图像中的应用。

Method: 采用基于当前状态的灵活坐标系，结合异步优势演员评论家（A3C）算法，实现了在任何位置或方向上的体积导航。

Result: 在4D流MRI中，该方法在平面重新格式化的角度和距离误差（6.32±4.15°和3.40±2.75毫米）上表现出更高的准确性，且与专家操作的流测量结果统计等效（p=0.21）。

Conclusion: 该方法的灵活性和适应性使其不仅适用于4D流MRI，还有望扩展到其他医学成像应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in
plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the
position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location.
This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed
landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and
resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test
dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In
this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate
system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any
position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic
(A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN).
Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane
reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75
mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a
plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility
and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging
applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在处理含噪声观测数据和物理信息缺失的反问题时性能受限，需增强其鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 使用NSGA-III多目标优化生成Pareto前沿上的PINNs集成成员，结合集成卡尔曼滤波（EnKF）同化噪声数据，迭代更新参数。

Result: 在一维粘性Burgers方程和时间分数阶混合扩散波方程上验证，该方法优于标准PINNs。

Conclusion: MoPINNEnKF框架通过多目标优化与数据同化的协同迭代，显著提升了复杂场景下PDE求解的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations
(PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the
performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy
observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In
this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter
(MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in
both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter}
and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III).
Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate
various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while
accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members
are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The
EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for
retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The
iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed
method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers
equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The
numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and
missing physics.

Motivation: 传统线性链条件随机场(CRF)推理速度慢，需开发支持并行化推断的替代方案。

Method: 基于Bregman投影的迭代推理算法，采用Fenchel-Young损失函数学习模型（支持部分标注数据）。

Result: 在强约束场景下优于平均场方法，与CRF精度相当但推理速度更快。

Conclusion: BCRF在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率，为序列标注任务提供新选择。

Abstract: We propose a novel discriminative model for sequence labeling called Bregman
conditional random fields (BCRF). Contrary to standard linear-chain conditional
random fields, BCRF allows fast parallelizable inference algorithms based on
iterative Bregman projections. We show how such models can be learned using
Fenchel-Young losses, including extension for learning from partial labels.
Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being
faster, and achieves better results in highly constrained settings compared to

Motivation: KV记忆和FW记忆各有优缺点：KV记忆检索精确但计算复杂度高，FW记忆支持长序列但牺牲了精确性。论文旨在通过混合这两种记忆系统，发挥各自的优势。

Method: 提出了三种混合KV记忆和FW记忆的方法，并在340M和1.3B参数模型上进行了实验，包括语言建模、检索任务和合成算法任务。

Result: 实验表明，混合记忆系统能够克服单一记忆系统的局限性，在语言建模、检索任务和强化学习中表现出色。

Conclusion: 精心设计的混合记忆系统可以结合KV记忆和FW记忆的优势，为神经记忆系统的设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We develop hybrid memory architectures for general-purpose sequence
processing neural networks, that combine key-value memory using softmax
attention (KV-memory) with dynamic synaptic memory through fast-weight
programming (FW-memory) -- the core principles of quadratic and linear
transformers, respectively. These two memory systems have complementary but
individually limited properties: KV-memory offers precise retrieval but is
constrained by quadratic complexity in sequence length, while FW-memory
supports arbitrarily long sequences and enables more expressive computation but
sacrifices precise recall. We propose and compare three methods to blend these
two systems into a single memory system to leverage the strengths of both. We
conduct experiments on general language modeling and retrieval tasks by
training 340M- and 1.3B-parameter models from scratch, as well as on synthetic
algorithmic tasks designed to precisely illustrate the benefits of certain
hybrid methods over others. We also evaluate our hybrid memory systems on
reinforcement learning in partially observable environments. Overall, we
demonstrate how a well-designed hybrid can overcome the limitations of its
individual components, offering new insights into the design principle of
neural memory systems.

TL;DR: SHIFT框架通过子群扫描和分层推理，定位并解释机器学习模型在新环境中的性能下降问题，提供针对性解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在新环境中部署时，性能下降往往不均匀，某些子群可能受到较大影响。现有方法无法详细解释性能下降的原因或仅识别受影响子群而缺乏深入分析。

Method: 提出SHIFT框架，首先识别性能下降显著的子群（Where?），然后深入分析具体变量或子集的变化如何导致性能下降（How?）。

Result: 实验证明，SHIFT能够识别受性能下降影响的子群，并提供有效的针对性措施来缓解性能下降。

Conclusion: SHIFT框架为机器学习模型在新环境中的性能下降问题提供了详细的分析和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models frequently experience performance degradation
when deployed in new contexts. Such degradation is rarely uniform: some
subgroups may suffer large performance decay while others may not.
Understanding where and how large differences in performance arise is critical
for designing targeted corrective actions that mitigate decay for the most
affected subgroups while minimizing any unintended effects. Current approaches
do not provide such detailed insight, as they either (i) explain how average
performance shifts arise or (ii) identify adversely affected subgroups without
insight into how this occurred. To this end, we introduce a Subgroup-scanning
Hierarchical Inference Framework for performance drifT (SHIFT). SHIFT first
asks "Is there any subgroup with unacceptably large performance decay due to
covariate/outcome shifts?" (Where?) and, if so, dives deeper to ask "Can we
explain this using more detailed variable(subset)-specific shifts?" (How?). In
real-world experiments, we find that SHIFT identifies interpretable subgroups
affected by performance decay, and suggests targeted actions that effectively
mitigate the decay.

Motivation: Kalai和Teng的工作仅适用于无依赖图的平滑乘积分布，本文旨在将其推广到更一般的马尔可夫随机场，以解决监督学习中的结构学习问题。

Method: 算法分为两个阶段：(1) 无监督结构学习阶段；(2) 贪婪监督学习算法。

Result: 这是首个证明无向图模型结构学习算法能高效解决监督学习问题的实例。

Conclusion: 该算法在平滑分析框架下成功扩展了Kalai和Teng的工作，为马尔可夫随机场中的监督学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We give an algorithm for learning $O(\log n)$ juntas in polynomial-time with
respect to Markov Random Fields (MRFs) in a smoothed analysis framework where
only the external field has been randomly perturbed. This is a broad
generalization of the work of Kalai and Teng, who gave an algorithm that
succeeded with respect to smoothed product distributions (i.e., MRFs whose
dependency graph has no edges). Our algorithm has two phases: (1) an
unsupervised structure learning phase and (2) a greedy supervised learning
algorithm. This is the first example where algorithms for learning the
structure of an undirected graphical model lead to provably efficient
algorithms for supervised learning.

TL;DR: InterGAT提出了一种简化GAT的方法，通过可学习的对称节点交互矩阵替代预定义图结构，提升了时空预测的准确性和计算效率，并增强了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图注意力网络（GAT）依赖预定义的邻接结构和动态注意力分数，导致归纳偏差和计算开销，同时影响模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出InterGAT，用完全可学习的对称节点交互矩阵替代掩码注意力机制，结合GRU时序解码器构建InterGAT-GRU框架。

Result: 在SZ-Taxi和Los-Loop数据集上，预测精度分别提升21%和6%，训练时间减少60-70%，且学习到的交互矩阵具有可解释的拓扑结构。

Conclusion: InterGAT在动态图场景中实现了预测性能、计算效率与拓扑可解释性的平衡，为时空预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic
prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they
rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores,
introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure
interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked
attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing
latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our
framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder,
outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a
21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop
dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we
observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it
recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community
structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both
localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology
driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously
support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity
in dynamic graph-based domains.

Abstract: Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and
designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as
shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning
approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or
property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot
molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D
molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named
MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space
independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an
SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes,
distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and
molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN)
conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive
performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks.
Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation,
including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent
interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our
approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor,
generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key
interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the
flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new
avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LIFT的低秩稀疏微调方法，通过仅更新5%的关键权重（主权重），在保持高效的同时，优于全参数微调，并在推理任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全参数微调（Full FT）虽然强大，但计算成本高且容易过拟合和灾难性遗忘，尤其在数据有限时。稀疏微调在效率与效果间提供了折中方案，但在大语言模型（LLM）时代表现不佳，因难以识别真正关键的推理参数。

Method: 提出低秩信息稀疏微调（LIFT），通过低秩近似识别关键权重（主权重），仅更新前5%的主权重，实现高效微调。

Result: LIFT在推理任务中表现优于Full FT，内存效率与流行的参数高效微调方法相当，并在算术推理等目标领域表现强劲，同时保留更多源领域知识（比Full FT和LoRA多20%）。

Conclusion: LIFT是一种高效且有效的稀疏微调方法，通过低秩近似识别关键权重，显著提升推理任务表现，同时保持内存效率和知识保留能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small
number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities.
However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally
expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting,
particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously
achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters,
offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has
lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters
truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the
largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for
fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while
magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM
fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights
motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only
updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently
achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining
memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic
reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared
to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recently, supervised learning (SL) methodology has emerged as an effective
approach for offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their simplicity,
stability, and efficiency. However, recent studies show that SL methods lack
the trajectory stitching capability, typically associated with temporal
difference (TD)-based approaches. A question naturally surfaces: How can we
endow SL methods with stitching capability and bridge its performance gap with
TD learning? To answer this question, we introduce $Q$-conditioned maximization
supervised learning for offline goal-conditioned RL, which enhances SL with the
stitching capability through $Q$-conditioned policy and $Q$-conditioned
maximization. Concretely, we propose Goal-Conditioned Reinforced Supervised
Learning (GCReinSL), which consists of (1) estimating the $Q$-function by CVAE
from the offline dataset and (2) finding the maximum $Q$-value within the data
support by integrating $Q$-function maximization with Expectile Regression. In
inference time, our policy chooses optimal actions based on such a maximum
$Q$-value. Experimental results from stitching evaluations on offline RL
datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior SL approaches with
stitching capabilities and goal data augmentation techniques.

Conclusion: 稀疏ADG策略在多智能体强化学习中具有潜力，能够平衡计算复杂度和全局最优性，适用于更广泛的挑战。

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental
states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive
action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of
all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational
complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In
this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies,
which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the
`action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies.
Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove
that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global
optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the
coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a
tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality.
Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and
conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the
robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios,
underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

Result: 在7个时空数据集上验证，DST-SGNN在保持较低计算成本的同时优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DST-SGNN通过流形约束和动态图优化，实现了时空序列预测效率与精度的平衡。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal time series (STTS) have been widely used in many
applications. However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to
complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph
neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling
dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the
Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently
process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral
Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix
in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded
as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic
Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn
the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the
computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that
efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive
experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.

fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models (LLMs) by constraining
weight updates to low-rank matrices. Recent works such as Tied-LoRA, VeRA, and
VB-LoRA push efficiency further by introducing additional constraints to reduce
the trainable parameter space. In this paper, we show that the parameter space
reduction strategies employed by these LoRA variants can be formulated within a
unified framework, Uni-LoRA, where the LoRA parameter space, flattened as a
high-dimensional vector space $R^D$, can be reconstructed through a projection
from a subspace R^d, with $d \ll D$. We demonstrate that the fundamental
difference among various LoRA methods lies in the choice of the projection
matrix, $P \in R^{D \times d}$.Most existing LoRA variants rely on layer-wise
or structure-specific projections that limit cross-layer parameter sharing,
thereby compromising parameter efficiency. In light of this, we introduce an
efficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric,
enabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead.
Furthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a
single trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM -
making Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a "one-vector-only" solution.
Extensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning
benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter
efficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive
performance.

*Jiahao Zhang,Yilong Wang,Zhiwei Zhang,Xiaorui Liu,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对图神经网络(GNN)去学习方法的逆向攻击TrendAttack，通过利用模型置信度下降模式和自适应预测机制，成功重构被删除的边，揭示了当前图去学习方法的隐私漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图去学习方法假设被删除的敏感数据无法恢复，但本文挑战这一假设，探究攻击者能否通过黑盒访问去学习后的GNN和部分图知识重构被移除的边。

Method: 提出TrendAttack框架：1) 利用'置信度陷阱'理论模式识别未学习边相邻节点的置信度骤降特征；2) 设计自适应预测机制，对未学习边和其他成员边应用不同相似度阈值。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，TrendAttack显著优于现有GNN成员推理基线方法，攻击成功率提升明显。

Conclusion: 当前图去学习方法存在严重隐私风险，攻击者可利用模型置信度特征和自适应阈值技术有效重构敏感数据，需重新评估去学习机制的安全性。

Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive
data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted
information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by
introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access
to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct
the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying
probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the
difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with
TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical
and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a
large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction
mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other
membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership
inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four
real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical
privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估了LLMs在因果发现中的角色，反对其直接参与确定因果关系，主张将其限制在辅助功能上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献中LLMs在因果发现中的直接应用存在理论缺陷和不可靠性，论文旨在揭示其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过实证研究分析LLMs在因果发现中的表现，并设计实验验证将其限制在非决策性辅助角色（如启发式搜索）的效果。

Result: 实验表明，严格隔离LLMs的因果决策功能后，其引导的启发式搜索能加速收敛，并在因果结构学习中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 呼吁学界停止简单应用LLMs，转而开发符合因果发现核心原理的专用模型和训练方法。

Abstract: This paper critically re-evaluates LLMs' role in causal discovery and argues
against their direct involvement in determining causal relationships. We
demonstrate that LLMs' autoregressive, correlation-driven modeling inherently
lacks the theoretical grounding for causal reasoning and introduces
unreliability when used as priors in causal discovery algorithms. Through
empirical studies, we expose the limitations of existing LLM-based methods and
reveal that deliberate prompt engineering (e.g., injecting ground-truth
knowledge) could overstate their performance, helping to explain the
consistently favorable results reported in much of the current literature.
Based on these findings, we strictly confined LLMs' role to a non-decisional
auxiliary capacity: LLMs should not participate in determining the existence or
directionality of causal relationships, but can assist the search process for
causal graphs (e.g., LLM-based heuristic search). Experiments across various
settings confirm that, by strictly isolating LLMs from causal decision-making,
LLM-guided heuristic search can accelerate the convergence and outperform both
traditional and LLM-based methods in causal structure learning. We conclude
with a call for the community to shift focus from naively applying LLMs to
developing specialized models and training method that respect the core
principles of causal discovery.

TL;DR: 该论文提出用强化学习替代监督微调，提升LLMs在合成图数据上的泛化能力，并在真实世界任务中验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过监督微调使LLMs擅长解决合成图算法问题，但缺乏对真实世界隐含图结构任务的泛化能力。

Method: 设计基于解和基于过程的奖励机制，采用GRPO和DPO等强化学习算法，对现成LLMs和微调后LLMs进行对齐。

Result: 在5个数据集上平均提升12.9%，基于过程的奖励表现更优，混合数据带来潜在收益，但可解释中间步骤仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效提升LLMs的图推理泛化能力，但组合性和可解释性仍是待解决问题。

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of
LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to
specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs
for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to
real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to
unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement
learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for
synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in
direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials
underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms
such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on
synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both
in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit
graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant
improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline
settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently
outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data
yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate
steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

TL;DR: 论文通过Tensor Programs框架，严格推导了单注意力层在无限宽度下的极限分布，证明其非高斯性，为深度Transformer架构的统一理论奠定基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯近似的无限宽度理论无法准确描述注意力层的行为，尤其是在常规架构和标准缩放下。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用Tensor Programs框架，在标准$1/\sqrt{n}$缩放和实际架构维度下，推导单注意力层的无限宽度极限分布。

Result: 发现注意力层的极限分布具有层次结构的非高斯性，数值实验验证了理论预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅刻画了单注意力层的极限行为，还为无限宽度下深度Transformer的统一理论提供了基础。

Abstract: In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit
is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations
(e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However,
these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the
behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely
many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor
Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit
distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic
architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$
dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to
infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it
departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits
non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on
the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical
predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and
accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a
standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a
unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决语音数据隐私保护、过时或噪声数据移除以及偏见缓解等问题，填补了语音领域机器遗忘研究的空白。

Method: 定义了两种语音遗忘任务：样本遗忘（移除单个数据点）和类别遗忘（移除整个类别），并在关键词识别和说话人识别任务上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，语音数据的遗忘比图像或文本数据更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括结构化训练、鲁棒评估、特征级遗忘、更广泛的应用、可扩展方法及对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored
research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence
of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has
important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy
data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in
computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is
largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and
speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech
unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points
(e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire
category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the
remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification
demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than
unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this
area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level
unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，用于分析扩散模型和变分自编码器的泛化性能，并通过信息论工具提供了可计算的泛化界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型（DMs）和变分自编码器（VAEs）在实证中取得了成功，但它们的泛化性能在理论上尚未得到充分探索，尤其是缺乏对共享编码器-生成器结构的全面考虑。

Method: 利用信息论工具，提出了一个统一的理论框架，将编码器和生成器视为随机映射，从而为它们的泛化性能提供保证。该框架进一步支持对VAEs的细化分析，并展示了DMs中依赖于扩散时间T的显式权衡。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实证结果验证了所提出理论的有效性，并展示了如何通过优化扩散时间T来提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为DMs和VAEs的泛化性能提供了理论支持，并提出了可计算的泛化界限，有助于模型优化和性能提升。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically
underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared
encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we
propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the
generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized
mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs,
accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked;
(2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that
depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs
based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$
and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve
model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets
illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散的生成模型在模拟湍流等复杂流体系统时存在频谱偏差和共模噪声问题，限制了高保真流场生成能力。

Conclusion: FourierFlow通过显式和隐式频域学习机制有效提升湍流生成质量，为复杂流体模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling complex fluid systems, especially turbulence governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs), remains a fundamental challenge in science and
engineering. Recently, diffusion-based generative models have gained attention
as a powerful approach for these tasks, owing to their capacity to capture
long-range dependencies and recover hierarchical structures. However, we
present both empirical and theoretical evidence showing that generative models
struggle with significant spectral bias and common-mode noise when generating
high-fidelity turbulent flows. Here we propose FourierFlow, a novel generative
turbulence modeling framework that enhances the frequency-aware learning by
both implicitly and explicitly mitigating spectral bias and common-mode noise.
FourierFlow comprises three key innovations. Firstly, we adopt a dual-branch
backbone architecture, consisting of a salient flow attention branch with
local-global awareness to focus on sensitive turbulence areas. Secondly, we
introduce a frequency-guided Fourier mixing branch, which is integrated via an
adaptive fusion strategy to explicitly mitigate spectral bias in the generative
model. Thirdly, we leverage the high-frequency modeling capabilities of the
masked auto-encoder pre-training and implicitly align the features of the
generative model toward high-frequency components. We validate the
effectiveness of FourierFlow on three canonical turbulent flow scenarios,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits strong generalization capabilities
in challenging settings such as out-of-distribution domains, long-term temporal
extrapolation, and robustness to noisy inputs. The code can be found at

Motivation: 扩散模型在长时程稀疏奖励任务中表现良好，但因采样过程中的引导不准确可能导致不可行轨迹，限制了其在安全关键场景的应用。

Method: 提出LoMAP（局部流形近似与投影），无需训练，通过将引导样本投影到离线数据集近似的低秩子空间，避免生成不可行轨迹。

Conclusion: LoMAP通过流形投影有效解决了扩散模型的轨迹可行性问题，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated
significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging
offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their
reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of
producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in
safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these
failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate
the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance
gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and
Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto
a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible
trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline
reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon
planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be
incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further
performance enhancements.

Conclusion: ModuLM通过模块化设计解决了MRL与LLM整合的基准测试挑战，为生化研究提供高效工具。

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) aims to understand interactions between
molecular pairs, playing a critical role in advancing biochemical research.
With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number
of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved
promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and
molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space,
presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM
framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic
architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding,
and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to
support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular
representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including
8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation
encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing
to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic
construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we
provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in
supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.

Conclusion: SCoTS通过轨迹增强有效解决了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的数据局限性，为长程规划任务提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for
long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline
datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality
and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to
tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To
overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching
(SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally
stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse
and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving
latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the
environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by
directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent
space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and
generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned
benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore,
augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance
of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse
environments.

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明，PCoreSet选择策略在ActiveKD框架中持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了AL与KD交叉领域的发展，通过VLMs的泛化能力实现了有限标注预算下的高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact,
task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However,
its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation
costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems
from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data,
whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models
are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that
integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of
large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured
prediction bias of VLMs -- i.e., their predictions form clusters in the
probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher
model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning.
To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection
strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the
feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled
samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under
limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet
consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD
framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian posterior sampling techniques have demonstrated superior empirical
performance in many exploration-exploitation settings. However, their
theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior
Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian
posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling
algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular
episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of
$\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in
the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the
number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides
several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior
sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along
with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a
starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique
in even more complex RL settings.

Motivation: 在安全敏感的应用中，不确定性量化至关重要，但现成的神经网络通常忽略这一点，因为会影响预测性能。传统方法通常需要访问模型参数或梯度，限制了实际可行性。

Method: 论文提出了一种后处理不确定性估计框架，通过拟合辅助模型到原始输入和冻结模型输出，基于最大似然估计和顺序参数拟合原则，形式化了一个精确的后处理优化目标。

Conclusion: 该方法在不依赖基础模型预测的情况下，正确估计了输入依赖的不确定性，并在玩具问题和UCI及深度回归基准测试中得到了验证。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but
is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on
predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically
requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in
practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc
uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to
both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of
maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an
exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of
Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference.
While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly
characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the
extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We
find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the
original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric
performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable
latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and
confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of
input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model
forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both
UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/biggzlar/IO-CUE.

Motivation: 当前深度序列模型在测试序列远超训练长度时精度下降，而算法推理、多步算术等任务需要强大的长度外推能力。

Method: 提出PRISM（概率相对位置隐式叠加模型），通过可微分直方图滤波更新学习连续相对位置，用概率叠加替代确定性嵌入保持位置不确定性。

Conclusion: PRISM的随机位置编码保持清晰可解释的内部状态，为长度泛化提供了理论基础，推动神经网络在远超训练长度的序列中保持算法鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences
significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as
algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional
generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a
Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel
positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate
accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous
relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving
position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional
deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length
extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence
lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition,
multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived
from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's
stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal
states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These
results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically
robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy, leveraging aggregated
updates to build robust global models. However, this training paradigm faces
significant challenges due to data heterogeneity and limited local datasets,
which often impede effective collaboration. In such scenarios, we identify the
Layer-wise Inertia Phenomenon in FL, wherein the middle layers of global model
undergo minimal updates after early communication rounds, ultimately limiting
the effectiveness of global aggregation. We demonstrate the presence of this
phenomenon across a wide range of federated settings, spanning diverse datasets
and architectures. To address this issue, we propose LIPS (Layer-wise Inertia
Phenomenon with Sparsity), a simple yet effective method that periodically
introduces transient sparsity to stimulate meaningful updates and empower
global aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that LIPS effectively mitigates
layer-wise inertia, enhances aggregation effectiveness, and improves overall
performance in various FL scenarios. This work not only deepens the
understanding of layer-wise learning dynamics in FL but also paves the way for
more effective collaboration strategies in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 当前基于图神经网络的分子代谢稳定性预测方法存在两个主要问题：原子中心的消息传递机制忽略了键级拓扑特征，以及缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 提出TrustworthyMS框架，包括分子图拓扑重映射机制、对比拓扑-键对齐和Beta-Binomial不确定性量化方法。

Result: 实验表明，TrustworthyMS在预测性能上优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: TrustworthyMS通过结合拓扑特征和不确定性量化，显著提升了分子代谢稳定性预测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for
drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex
interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural
networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical
limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric
message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and
(2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To
address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive
learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability
prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes
atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both
localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second,
contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular
topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing
representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial
uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence
calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our
results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in terms of predictive performance.

*Xiaohan Wang,Yu Zhang,Guibin Jiang,Bing Cheng,Wei Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于聚类视角的营销预算分配新方法，通过多任务表示网络学习个体属性并进行分组，有效解决了大规模反事实预测和求解复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有营销优化方法通常采用‘先预测后优化’策略，但在数据质量不可控和大规模求解（数千万级）的情况下，鲁棒的预算分配变得非常困难，尤其是在工业场景中存在大量数据噪声时。

Method: 论文提出了一种多任务表示网络来学习个体属性，并通过网络前两层将原始特征映射到高维隐藏表示；随后基于聚类将这些表示分为K组，将问题重新表述为不同总预算下的整数随机规划问题；最后将表示模块和聚类模型蒸馏为多类别模型以便在线部署。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的基于聚类的营销预算分配方法在工业场景中表现出色，能够有效处理大规模数据噪声并实现鲁棒的预算分配。

Abstract: Marketing optimization, commonly formulated as an online budget allocation
problem, has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving user growth. Most existing
research addresses this problem by following the principle of 'first predict
then optimize' for each individual, which presents challenges related to
large-scale counterfactual prediction and solving complexity trade-offs. Note
that the practical data quality is uncontrollable, and the solving scale tends
to be tens of millions. Therefore, the existing approaches make the robust
budget allocation non-trivial, especially in industrial scenarios with
considerable data noise. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach that
solves the problem from the cluster perspective. Specifically, we propose a
multi-task representation network to learn the inherent attributes of
individuals and project the original features into high-dimension hidden
representations through the first two layers of the trained network. Then, we
divide these hidden representations into $K$ groups through partitioning-based
clustering, thus reformulating the problem as an integer stochastic programming
problem under different total budgets. Finally, we distill the representation
module and clustering model into a multi-category model to facilitate online
deployment. Offline experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our approach compared to six state-of-the-art marketing optimization
algorithms. Online A/B tests on the Meituan platform indicate that the approach
outperforms the online algorithm by 0.53% and 0.65%, considering order volume
(OV) and gross merchandise volume (GMV), respectively.

Method: 提出Decentralized Anytime SGD算法，在随机凸优化(SCO)框架下建立理论并行上限，超越现有技术。

Result: 该算法突破了现有并行计算阈值，使大规模网络获得更好统计保证，在高度连接拓扑中缩小了与中心化学习的差距。

Conclusion: Decentralized Anytime SGD显著提升了去中心化学习的可扩展性，为大规模分布式计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Decentralized learning has emerged as a powerful approach for handling large
datasets across multiple machines in a communication-efficient manner. However,
such methods often face scalability limitations, as increasing the number of
machines beyond a certain point negatively impacts convergence rates. In this
work, we propose Decentralized Anytime SGD, a novel decentralized learning
algorithm that significantly extends the critical parallelism threshold,
enabling the effective use of more machines without compromising performance.
Within the stochastic convex optimization (SCO) framework, we establish a
theoretical upper bound on parallelism that surpasses the current
state-of-the-art, allowing larger networks to achieve favorable statistical
guarantees and closing the gap with centralized learning in highly connected
topologies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了标准强化学习框架至随机时间范围，针对现实应用中常见的随机停止时间问题，首次严格推导了策略梯度公式，并通过实验验证其优化效果优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中许多场景存在随机（可能依赖轨迹的）停止时间，而传统强化学习框架通常假设固定或无限时间范围，无法有效处理这类问题。

Method: 提出两种互补视角（基于轨迹和状态空间），严格推导随机和确定性策略下的策略梯度公式，并与最优控制理论建立联系。

Result: 数值实验表明，与传统方法相比，使用新推导的公式能显著提升优化收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理随机停止时间的强化学习问题提供了理论工具，实验证明了其实际优化优势。

Abstract: We extend the standard reinforcement learning framework to random time
horizons. While the classical setting typically assumes finite and
deterministic or infinite runtimes of trajectories, we argue that multiple
real-world applications naturally exhibit random (potentially
trajectory-dependent) stopping times. Since those stopping times typically
depend on the policy, their randomness has an effect on policy gradient
formulas, which we (mostly for the first time) derive rigorously in this work
both for stochastic and deterministic policies. We present two complementary
perspectives, trajectory or state-space based, and establish connections to
optimal control theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that using the
proposed formulas can significantly improve optimization convergence compared
to traditional approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图注意力网络的自我监督方法，用于解决无小区大规模MIMO系统中的下行功率控制问题，有效应对导频污染和动态用户数变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于优化的功率控制算法计算复杂度高，难以实时应用；而现有基于图神经网络的方法假设理想导频正交性和固定用户数，与实际场景不符。此外，监督训练需要大量计算资源生成目标解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能优异，甚至优于作为基线的加速投影梯度最优方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在计算效率和适应性方面具有显著优势，为无小区大规模MIMO系统的实时功率控制提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Optimization-based power control algorithms are predominantly iterative with
high computational complexity, making them impractical for real-time
applications in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO)
systems. Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and
among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent
performance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based
approaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments
(UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available
orthogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based
methods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies
over time in practice. Additionally, supervised training necessitates costly
computational resources for computing the target power control solutions for a
large volume of training samples. To address these issues, we propose a graph
attention network for downlink power control in CFmMIMO systems that operates
in a self-supervised manner while effectively handling pilot contamination and
adapting to a dynamic number of UEs. Experimental results show its
effectiveness, even in comparison to the optimal accelerated projected gradient
method as a baseline.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of
machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically
designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic
diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues,
including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across
different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a
nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the
development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we
present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a
paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity
throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to
model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of
critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation
systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of
heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper
understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and
reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into
future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining
community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

*Jonathan Bobrutsky,Amit Moscovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在规则网格上高效计算Wasserstein距离近似值的方法，通过粗网格量化求解和上采样校正，在保持误差低于2%的同时实现10-100倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wasserstein度量在生成建模、图像检索和领域适应等机器学习应用中日益重要，但其计算成本高昂。现有近似方法往往牺牲精度换取效率，本文旨在开发既能保证计算效率又能提供严格上下界的方法。

Method: 针对规则网格上的离散测度，首先在粗网格上使用量化测度和特殊设计的成本矩阵精确求解Kantorovich问题，然后通过原始空间或对偶空间的上采样校正阶段获得全分辨率输入的Wasserstein距离有效上下界。

Result: 在DOTmark最优传输基准测试中，该方法相比熵正则化最优传输加速10-100倍，同时保持近似误差低于2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为Wasserstein距离计算提供了高效且精度可控的近似方案，显著提升了计算效率而不牺牲理论保证。

Abstract: The Wasserstein metric has become increasingly important in many machine
learning applications such as generative modeling, image retrieval and domain
adaptation. Despite its appeal, it is often too costly to compute. This has
motivated approximation methods like entropy-regularized optimal transport,
downsampling, and subsampling, which trade accuracy for computational
efficiency. In this paper, we consider the challenge of computing efficient
approximations to the Wasserstein metric that also serve as strict upper or
lower bounds. Focusing on discrete measures on regular grids, our approach
involves formulating and exactly solving a Kantorovich problem on a coarse grid
using a quantized measure and specially designed cost matrix, followed by an
upscaling and correction stage. This is done either in the primal or dual space
to obtain valid upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein metric of the
full-resolution inputs. We evaluate our methods on the DOTmark optimal
transport images benchmark, demonstrating a 10x-100x speedup compared to
entropy-regularized OT while keeping the approximation error below 2%.

TL;DR: LoRA-BAM方法通过盒抽象在LoRA层添加OoD检测监控器，提升领域特定任务性能并防止过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLMs）虽能提升领域特定任务性能，但可能导致过拟合，使其在分布外（OoD）查询上不可靠。

Method: 利用盒抽象在LoRA层添加OoD检测监控器，提取微调数据的特征向量并聚类，通过盒边界判断OoD问题，并引入正则化损失增强可解释性和鲁棒性。

Result: 该方法提供了一种轻量级且可解释的OoD检测机制，有效补充现有防御措施。

Conclusion: LoRA-BAM通过盒抽象和正则化损失，显著提升了模型在OoD检测上的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) improves performance on
domain-specific tasks but can lead to overfitting, making them unreliable on
out-of-distribution (OoD) queries. We propose LoRA-BAM - a method that adds OoD
detection monitors to the LoRA layer using boxed abstraction to filter
questions beyond the model's competence. Feature vectors from the fine-tuning
data are extracted via the LLM and clustered. Clusters are enclosed in boxes; a
question is flagged as OoD if its feature vector falls outside all boxes. To
improve interpretability and robustness, we introduce a regularization loss
during fine-tuning that encourages paraphrased questions to stay close in the
feature space, and the enlargement of the decision boundary is based on the
feature variance within a cluster. Our method complements existing defenses by
providing lightweight and interpretable OoD detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉重编程方法为所有类别训练单一视觉提示，难以捕捉多样属性且易偏向非判别性特征。

Method: DVP框架：1) 按显式原因或聚类分组优化解耦视觉提示；2) 设计概率重加权矩阵(PRM)集成各提示输出。

Result: 在11个下游数据集上超越基线，DVP-PRM组合可解释各视觉提示对分类决策的影响。

Conclusion: DVP通过解耦提示与概率加权降低经验风险边界，为模型重编程提供可解释概率框架。

Abstract: Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying
only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for
vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to
input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR
approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of
different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result
in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape,
color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes
that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a
decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are
optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or
unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual
prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their
contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical
risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11
downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how
individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a
probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available

Motivation: 研究不对称架构（较小的actor）在actor-critic方法中的影响，以理解其对性能的具体作用。

Method: 通过广泛的实证研究和分析，探讨不对称架构对性能的影响，并提出缓解价值低估的技术。

Result: 发现较小的actor会导致性能下降和critic过拟合，主要原因是价值低估导致的数据收集不良。

Conclusion: critic在缓解不对称架构问题中起关键作用，提出的技术有助于进一步研究不对称actor-critic方法。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods have been central to many of the recent advances in deep
reinforcement learning. The most common approach is to use symmetric
architectures, whereby both actor and critic have the same network topology and
number of parameters. However, recent works have argued for the advantages of
asymmetric setups, specifically with the use of smaller actors. We perform
broad empirical investigations and analyses to better understand the
implications of this and find that, in general, smaller actors result in
performance degradation and overfit critics. Our analyses suggest poor data
collection, due to value underestimation, as one of the main causes for this
behavior, and further highlight the crucial role the critic can play in
alleviating this pathology. We explore techniques to mitigate the observed
value underestimation, which enables further research in asymmetric
actor-critic methods.

Conclusion: SGG是一种稳健的大语言模型优化方案，显著提升了训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive
scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW
help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and
effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training
instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient
Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate
estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups
gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies
cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus
imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise
per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that
SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains
and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability
across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust
choice for LLM optimization.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference
(TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in
reinforcement learning. While prior work has established convergence
guarantees, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is
projected onto a bounded set or that the learning rate is set according to the
unknown strong convexity constant -- conditions that are both artificial and do
not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such assumptions and present a
refined analysis of TD learning. We show that the simple projection-free
variant converges with a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence
of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the
TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Result: 所有测试的验证工具均被新型部署环境攻击攻破，表明其不具备实际严谨性。

Conclusion: 实现实际严谨性比理论严谨性计算代价更高，现有验证方法需重新设计以适应真实环境。

Abstract: The ultimate goal of verification is to guarantee the safety of deployed
neural networks. Here, we claim that all the state-of-the-art verifiers we are
aware of fail to reach this goal. Our key insight is that theoretical soundness
(bounding the full-precision output while computing with floating point) does
not imply practical soundness (bounding the floating point output in a
potentially stochastic environment). We prove this observation for the
approaches that are currently used to achieve provable theoretical soundness,
such as interval analysis and its variants. We also argue that achieving
practical soundness is significantly harder computationally. We support our
claims empirically as well by evaluating several well-known verification
methods. To mislead the verifiers, we create adversarial networks that detect
and exploit features of the deployment environment, such as the order and
precision of floating point operations. We demonstrate that all the tested
verifiers are vulnerable to our new deployment-specific attacks, which proves
that they are not practically sound.

Conclusion: XAI-Units为特征归因方法提供了可靠的评估框架，有助于推动可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to
help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to
its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance
scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge
about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully
determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations
in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce
the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA
methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature
interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides
a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms,
establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied
by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic
experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic
kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering.
Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets,
we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a
crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE
methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated
short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or
PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several
challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of
deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the
sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness
to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat
history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies
for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE
methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection
when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these
methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos,
they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while
existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various
strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling
multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which
highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy. Code is available

### [460] [Attention Retrieves, MLP Memorizes: Disentangling Trainable Components in the Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01115)
*Yihe Dong,Lorenzo Noci,Mikhail Khodak,Mufan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer的自注意力机制并非其性能提升的唯一关键，随机固定注意力的简化模型MixiT在某些算法任务上表现媲美完整Transformer，但检索任务仍需依赖输入相关的注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer架构中自注意力机制对性能提升的实际贡献，以及是否可以通过简化或固定部分组件来达到类似效果。

Method: 通过冻结MLP层或注意力投影器（查询和键），并引入完全随机固定注意力的简化模型MixiT，对比标准Transformer的性能差异。

Result: MixiT在基础算术和记忆任务上表现与完整Transformer相当，但在检索任务中表现较差；冻结查询和键投影器的注意力仍能形成关键电路（如归纳头）并在语言建模中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 架构的异构性（不同组件的互补性偏置）对解决不同任务至关重要，自注意力机制并非性能提升的唯一因素。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide
range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization,
and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction.
While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we
question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be
attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in
which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention
projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate
the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer --
a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely
random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation
or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the
performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks,
especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on
memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent
attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms.
We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as
induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and
exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we
find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to
form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling.
Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where
distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for
solving different classes of tasks.

Conclusion: NSD首次实现连续/离散数据生成的约束合规性，为安全关键领域提供了可靠生成方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their
integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications
remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical,
structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves
diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of
certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic
constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete
diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both
continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular
structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This
ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in
the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory
optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and
materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing
symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

Motivation: 当前大多数研究假设数据由均匀随机游走生成，而较少关注目标导向行为生成的数据对表示学习的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在空间设置中，目标导向行为会导致状态占用率的显著差异。

Method: 通过遍历马尔可夫链的最优慢特征视角，分析了目标导向行为对价值函数近似的影响，并评估了三种校正方法。此外，还考虑了目标规避行为的特殊情况。

Conclusion: 目标导向行为生成的数据对慢特征分析和价值函数近似有显著影响，校正方法可以有效改善这一问题。未来的研究可以进一步探索其他行为模式的影响。

Abstract: Slow Feature Analysis is a unsupervised representation learning method that
extracts slowly varying features from temporal data and can be used as a basis
for subsequent reinforcement learning. Often, the behavior that generates the
data on which the representation is learned is assumed to be a uniform random
walk. Less research has focused on using samples generated by goal-directed
behavior, as commonly the case in a reinforcement learning setting, to learn a
representation. In a spatial setting, goal-directed behavior typically leads to
significant differences in state occupancy between states that are close to a
reward location and far from a reward location.
  Through the perspective of optimal slow features on ergodic Markov chains,
this work investigates the effects of these differences on value-function
approximation in an idealized setting. Furthermore, three correction routes,
which can potentially alleviate detrimental scaling effects, are evaluated and
discussed. In addition, the special case of goal-averse behavior is considered.

TL;DR: ZapFormat提出了一种基于Earley算法的动态剪枝策略，显著降低了内存占用，并通过Formatron引擎实现了高达2倍的推理速度提升，同时保持高精度输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成符合严格结构或语法约束的输出时仍面临挑战，尤其是在函数调用和领域特定语言（DSL）生成中。现有的约束解码方法在每一步解码时检查所有词汇的有效性，导致显著的开销。

Method: 提出ZapFormat，一种基于Earley算法的动态剪枝策略，实时识别并消除无效或冗余的Earley状态，减少内存占用，并结合状态缓存加速结构化生成。

Result: 在结构化生成任务（如JSON生成、JSON Schema验证和语义解析）中，Formatron不仅保持高精度输出，推理速度还提升了高达2倍，且适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: Formatron通过ZapFormat和现有优化，显著提升了约束解码的效率和适用性，为LLMs的结构化输出生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring
their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains
challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language
(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible
approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically
building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the
validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which
often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To
address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel
$\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that
identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,
significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This
further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a
large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding
engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through
comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON
generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that
Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant
outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference
speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,
Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release
Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

TL;DR: WARP框架通过将权重空间学习与线性递归统一，重新定义了序列建模，提供了更高分辨率的记忆和无梯度测试时适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN将时间动态压缩为固定维度的隐藏状态，限制了模型的表达能力和适应性。WARP旨在通过显式参数化隐藏状态为根神经网络的权重，提升模型的记忆分辨率和适应性。

Method: WARP将隐藏状态参数化为根神经网络的权重，结合线性递归，支持无梯度测试时适应和领域特定物理先验的集成。

Result: 实验表明，WARP在分类任务、序列图像完成、动态系统重建和多变量时间序列预测中达到或超越现有技术基准。

Conclusion: WARP通过权重轨迹提供模型内部工作的洞察，关键组件的消融研究证实了其架构的必要性，为自适应机器智能提供了变革性范式。

Abstract: We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet
powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to
redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states,
WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root
neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory,
gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of
domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches
or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks,
spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive
experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system
reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its
expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight
trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation
studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying
weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前连续空间生成模型（如扩散模型和流匹配模型）在训练时虽具可扩展性，但生成高质量样本及计算模型似然需要昂贵的数值模拟，限制了在科学应用（如分子系统平衡采样）中的采用。

Method: 论文提出Forward-Only Regression Training (FORT)，一种简单的L2回归目标，将先验样本映射到特定目标，避免了传统最大似然训练中昂贵的变量变换公式计算。

Result: 实验表明，FORT支持多种目标（如最优传输目标和预训练连续时间归一化流目标），且通过使用CNF目标，一步流模型在性能和稳定性上超越最大似然训练，并支持更广泛的架构。

Conclusion: FORT框架在分子系统平衡采样等应用中表现出色，提供了一种高效且可扩展的生成模型训练方法。

Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the
generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to neural
dynamical systems that encompass modern large-scale diffusion and flow matching
models. Despite the scalability of training, the generation of high-quality
samples and their corresponding likelihood under the model requires expensive
numerical simulation -- inhibiting adoption in numerous scientific applications
such as equilibrium sampling of molecular systems. In this paper, we revisit
classical normalizing flows as one-step generative models with exact
likelihoods and propose a novel, scalable training objective that does not
require computing the expensive change of variable formula used in conventional
maximum likelihood training. We propose Forward-Only Regression Training
(FORT), a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective that maps prior samples under
our flow to specifically chosen targets. We demonstrate that FORT supports a
wide class of targets, such as optimal transport targets and targets from
pre-trained continuous-time normalizing flows (CNF). We further demonstrate
that by using CNF targets, our one-step flows allow for larger-scale training
that exceeds the performance and stability of maximum likelihood training,
while unlocking a broader class of architectures that were previously
challenging to train. Empirically, we elucidate that our trained flows can
perform equilibrium conformation sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine
dipeptide, alanine tripeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将线性时序逻辑（LTL）与可微分模拟器结合的方法，解决了强化学习中稀疏奖励问题，同时保证了目标正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全保证方法（如状态避免和约束马尔可夫决策过程）难以捕捉轨迹需求或导致过于保守的行为。LTL虽能提供构造正确的学习目标，但其稀疏奖励使学习困难，而基于启发式的密集奖励可能影响正确性。

Method: 通过可微分范式耦合LTL与可微分模拟器，引入软标签实现可微分奖励和状态，有效缓解LTL固有的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在奖励获取和训练时间上均显著优于离散方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了LTL稀疏奖励问题，同时保持了目标正确性，为强化学习的安全可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: To ensure learned controllers comply with safety and reliability requirements
for reinforcement learning in real-world settings remains challenging.
Traditional safety assurance approaches, such as state avoidance and
constrained Markov decision processes, often inadequately capture trajectory
requirements or may result in overly conservative behaviors. To address these
limitations, recent studies advocate the use of formal specification languages
such as linear temporal logic (LTL), enabling the derivation of
correct-by-construction learning objectives from the specified requirements.
However, the sparse rewards associated with LTL specifications make learning
extremely difficult, whereas dense heuristic-based rewards risk compromising
correctness. In this work, we propose the first method, to our knowledge, that
integrates LTL with differentiable simulators, facilitating efficient
gradient-based learning directly from LTL specifications by coupling with
differentiable paradigms. Our approach introduces soft labeling to achieve
differentiable rewards and states, effectively mitigating the sparse-reward
issue intrinsic to LTL without compromising objective correctness. We validate
the efficacy of our method through experiments, demonstrating significant
improvements in both reward attainment and training time compared to the
discrete methods.

Method: 采用多目标贝叶斯优化方法，系统优化量子-经典桥接架构，特别关注生成对抗网络（GANs）在分子发现中的应用。

Result: 优化后的模型（BO-QGAN）性能显著提升，药物候选评分（DCS）比之前的量子混合基准提高了2.27倍，比经典基线提高了2.21倍，同时减少了60%以上的参数。

Conclusion: 研究首次为混合模型提供了基于实证的架构指导，表明多层（3-4层）浅层（4-8量子比特）量子电路的顺序排列效果最佳，而经典架构在超过最小容量后敏感性较低。

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model
architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical
bridge architecture for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in molecular
discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model
(BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug
Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher
than the classical baseline, using over 60% fewer parameters. Key findings
favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits
sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a
minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically grounded
architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration
of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.

Conclusion: DRPO有效解决了模型错误设定问题，为RLHF提供了更可靠的优化方法。

Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models with human preferences. While RLHF has
demonstrated promising results, many algorithms are highly sensitive to
misspecifications in the underlying preference model (e.g., the Bradley-Terry
model), the reference policy, or the reward function, resulting in undesirable
fine-tuning. To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust
preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the
preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without
requiring both). Our proposal demonstrates superior and more robust performance
than state-of-the-art algorithms, both in theory and in practice. The code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Robust-PCA的联邦学习方法FedRPCA，通过分解客户端LoRA参数为公共低秩和客户端特定稀疏组件，提升了在数据异构环境下的收敛速度和准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，数据异构性对基于LoRA的微调技术构成挑战，传统的FedAvg聚合策略收敛慢且准确率欠佳。受模型合并技术（如Task Arithmetic）启发，作者探索了通过缩放平均聚合客户端LoRA参数的方法。

Method: 提出FedRPCA算法：使用Robust-PCA将客户端LoRA更新分解为公共低秩组件（通过平均聚合）和客户端特定稀疏组件（通过缩放平均放大个性化知识）。

Result: 在多种视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，相比基线方法，FedRPCA实现了更高的最终准确率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 通过分离并差异化处理公共知识和客户端特定知识，FedRPCA有效解决了数据异构问题，为基于LoRA的联邦学习提供了更优的聚合策略。

Abstract: LoRA has emerged as one of the most promising fine-tuning techniques,
especially for federated learning (FL), since it significantly reduces
communication and computation costs at resource-constrained clients. However,
data heterogeneity remains a significant challenge for LoRA-based FL, and the
conventional aggregation strategy based on FedAvg suffers from slow convergence
and suboptimal accuracy. Motivated by recent advances in model merging,
particularly Task Arithmetic, we explore the idea of aggregating client LoRA
parameters using scaled averaging. We first observe that a naive application of
Task Arithmetic is ineffective due to the high cosine similarity between client
updates, indicating significant common knowledge in the updates across clients.
To address this issue, we propose decomposing client LoRA updates via Robust
Principal Component Analysis (Robust-PCA) into a common low-rank component and
client-specific sparse components. Our proposed algorithm FedRPCA aggregates
the low-rank components through averaging, consolidating common knowledge, and
applies scaled averaging to the sparse components to amplify client-specific
knowledge. We evaluate our approach across a variety of vision and language
tasks and demonstrate that it achieves higher final accuracy and faster
convergence compared to competing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖固定的时间分辨率，难以在多个时间尺度上检测异常行为，尤其是在网络安全等领域。

Method: ANIE通过两步实现：1)估计节点行为的低维子空间；2)计算新的经验亲和系数，量化潜在因素间的交互强度变化。

Result: 实验表明，ANIE能自适应选择合适的时间分辨率，捕获剧烈结构变化并对噪声保持鲁棒。

Conclusion: ANIE的多分辨率方法在检测结构变化方面优于固定分辨率方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Detecting structural change in dynamic network data has wide-ranging
applications. Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins,
extract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over
time. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the
statistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff,
reminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely
on a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is
typically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like
cybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We
address this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity
Estimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify
the time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint
detection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson
processes, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional
subspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity
coefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent
factors and support statistical testing for structural change across time
scales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the
asymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change
detection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the
appropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes
while remaining robust to noise. Furthermore, applications to real-world data
showcase the practical benefits of ANIE's multiresolution approach to detecting
structural change over fixed resolution methods.

Motivation: 传统时间嵌入方法（如时间点标识或正弦函数）难以捕捉复杂的多尺度周期性，且依赖人工设计特征。本文旨在通过数据驱动方式自动提取时间模式，以更好地建模长期季节性依赖。

Method: 采用动态模式分解（DMD）从观测数据中直接提取时间模态，作为可集成到深度时空预测模型中的时间表征。该方法通过时空数据的谱分析捕获多尺度周期性。

Result: 在城市交通、高速公路流量和气候数据集上的实验表明，DMD嵌入能持续提升长期预测精度、降低残差相关性，并增强时间泛化能力。该方法轻量、模型无关且兼容任何时间协变量架构。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动时间嵌入方法有效解决了长期季节性依赖建模问题，为时空预测任务提供了通用且高效的时间表征解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven time embedding method for modeling
long-range seasonal dependencies in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. The
proposed approach employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to extract temporal
modes directly from observed data, eliminating the need for explicit timestamps
or hand-crafted time features. These temporal modes serve as time
representations that can be seamlessly integrated into deep spatiotemporal
forecasting models. Unlike conventional embeddings such as time-of-day
indicators or sinusoidal functions, our method captures complex multi-scale
periodicity through spectral analysis of spatiotemporal data. Extensive
experiments on urban mobility, highway traffic, and climate datasets
demonstrate that the DMD-based embedding consistently improves long-horizon
forecasting accuracy, reduces residual correlation, and enhances temporal
generalization. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and compatible with
any architecture that incorporates time covariates.

Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools
for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across
diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability
of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph
structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and
deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we
study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a
novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that
focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation
characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This
way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on
the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and
perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to
validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing
baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on
downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the
proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data
distribution into stability analysis.

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) allows for predicting all the chemical and
physical properties of molecular systems from first principles by finding an
approximate solution to the many-body Schr\"odinger equation. However, the cost
of these predictions becomes infeasible when increasing the scale of the energy
evaluations, e.g., when calculating the ground-state energy for simulating
molecular dynamics. Recent works have demonstrated that, for substantially
large datasets of molecular conformations, Deep Learning-based models can
predict the outputs of the classical DFT solvers by amortizing the
corresponding optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method
that reduces the dependency of amortized DFT solvers on large pre-collected
datasets by introducing a self-refining training strategy. Namely, we propose
an efficient method that simultaneously trains a deep-learning model to predict
the DFT outputs and samples molecular conformations that are used as training
data for the model. We derive our method as a minimization of the variational
upper bound on the KL-divergence measuring the discrepancy between the
generated samples and the target Boltzmann distribution defined by the ground
state energy. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed scheme, we perform an
extensive empirical study comparing it with the models trained on the
pre-collected datasets. Finally, we open-source our implementation of the
proposed algorithm, optimized with asynchronous training and sampling stages,
which enables simultaneous sampling and training. Code is available at

*Jiongli Zhu,Geyang Xu,Felipe Lorenzi,Boris Glavic,Babak Salimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAVAGE框架通过因果建模和双层优化，系统性发现最坏情况数据质量问题，显著提升机器学习管道的鲁棒性测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习管道常因结构化数据质量问题（如与人口统计相关的缺失值、文化偏见标签等）导致可靠性下降，而当前鲁棒性评估方法过于简单，无法覆盖最坏情况。监管机构对高风险系统的抗干扰能力要求日益严格。

Method: 提出SAVAGE框架：(1) 通过依赖图和灵活 corruption 模板建模现实数据质量问题；(2) 采用双层优化方法，将完整ML管道视为黑箱，高效识别脆弱数据子群并优化 corruption 强度。

Result: 实验表明，SAVAGE发现的少量结构化 corruption（约5%）即可严重损害模型性能，远超随机或人工设计的错误，并推翻现有技术的核心假设。

Conclusion: SAVAGE为管道压力测试提供实用工具，建立鲁棒性评估基准，并为设计更健壮的数据工作流提供行动指南。

Abstract: Structured data-quality issues, such as missing values correlated with
demographics, culturally biased labels, or systemic selection biases, routinely
degrade the reliability of machine-learning pipelines. Regulators now
increasingly demand evidence that high-stakes systems can withstand these
realistic, interdependent errors, yet current robustness evaluations typically
use random or overly simplistic corruptions, leaving worst-case scenarios
unexplored. We introduce SAVAGE, a causally inspired framework that (i)
formally models realistic data-quality issues through dependency graphs and
flexible corruption templates, and (ii) systematically discovers corruption
patterns that maximally degrade a target performance metric. SAVAGE employs a
bi-level optimization approach to efficiently identify vulnerable data
subpopulations and fine-tune corruption severity, treating the full ML
pipeline, including preprocessing and potentially non-differentiable models, as
a black box. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and ML tasks (data
cleaning, fairness-aware learning, uncertainty quantification) demonstrate that
even a small fraction (around 5 %) of structured corruptions identified by
SAVAGE severely impacts model performance, far exceeding random or manually
crafted errors, and invalidating core assumptions of existing techniques. Thus,
SAVAGE provides a practical tool for rigorous pipeline stress-testing, a
benchmark for evaluating robustness methods, and actionable guidance for
designing more resilient data workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为梯度贡献（GC）的新方法，通过分析梯度方向冲突解决超网权重耦合问题，并设计了统一图神经架构搜索（UGAS）框架，实验证明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本神经架构搜索（NAS）方法在解决权重耦合问题时存在计算效率低和分区方案次优的问题，论文从梯度方向冲突的新视角出发，旨在更有效地解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出梯度贡献（GC）方法，通过分解向量-雅可比积计算模块间梯度方向的余弦相似度，将冲突梯度方向的模块分配到不同子超网；同时提出UGAS框架，探索消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）和图变换器（GTs）的最优组合。

Conclusion: 论文通过GC方法和UGAS框架有效解决了权重耦合问题，并在图神经架构搜索中取得了显著性能提升，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into
multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational
inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address
this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a
novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding
layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules.
Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method
that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among
modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet
backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions
are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped
together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of
existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to
searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph
Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal
combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality
and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC
outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS
methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all
proposed methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法在理论和实践中均表现出色，优于现有方法，适用于非线性效用函数的上下文对决赌博问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the contextual dueling bandit problem by proposing
variance-aware algorithms that leverage neural networks to approximate
nonlinear utility functions. Our approach employs a \textit{variance-aware
exploration strategy}, which adaptively accounts for uncertainty in pairwise
comparisons while relying only on the gradients with respect to the learnable
parameters of the last layer. This design effectively balances the
exploration--exploitation tradeoff under both the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
and Thompson Sampling (TS) frameworks. As a result, under standard assumptions,
we establish theoretical guarantees showing that our algorithms achieve
sublinear cumulative average regret of order $\bigol\lt(d \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^T
\sigma_t^2} + \sqrt{dT}\rt),$ for sufficiently wide neural networks, where $ d
$ is the contextual dimension, $ \sigma_t^2 $ the variance of comparisons at
round $ t $, and $ T $ the total number of rounds. We also empirically validate
that our approach offers reasonable computational efficiency and achieves
sublinear regret on both synthetic tasks with nonlinear utilities and
real-world tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的压缩算法，用于解决模型并行训练中的通信瓶颈问题，通过压缩激活和梯度，显著提高了通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习模型的扩展中，模型并行训练由于通信瓶颈问题而面临挑战。现有的压缩技术虽然适用于数据并行训练，但不适用于模型并行训练。因此，需要一种新的方法来压缩激活和梯度，以减少通信开销。

Method: 论文提出了一种压缩算法，通过利用Transformer网络中的递归结构，预定义一个低维子空间来限制激活和梯度，从而在后续层中实现完全重建。该方法在前后向传播中都进行了压缩，且内存和计算开销可忽略不计。

Result: 该方法实现了高达99%的压缩率，且不影响模型收敛。通信效率提升了100倍，使得在低端GPU和80Mbps的消费者级互联网速度下训练十亿参数规模的模型成为可能，性能与使用100Gbps连接的集中式数据中心系统相当。

Conclusion: 该压缩算法有效解决了模型并行训练中的通信瓶颈问题，显著提升了通信效率，使得在资源受限的环境下训练大规模模型成为可能。

Abstract: Scaling models has led to significant advancements in deep learning, but
training these models in decentralized settings remains challenging due to
communication bottlenecks. While existing compression techniques are effective
in data-parallel, they do not extend to model parallelism. Unlike data-parallel
training, where weight gradients are exchanged, model-parallel requires
compressing activations and activation gradients as they propagate through
layers, accumulating compression errors. We propose a novel compression
algorithm that compresses both forward and backward passes, enabling up to 99%
compression with no convergence degradation with negligible memory/compute
overhead. By leveraging a recursive structure in transformer networks, we
predefine a low-dimensional subspace to confine the activations and gradients,
allowing full reconstruction in subsequent layers. Our method achieves up to
100x improvement in communication efficiency and enables training
billion-parameter-scale models over low-end GPUs connected via consumer-grade
internet speeds as low as 80Mbps, matching the convergence of centralized
datacenter systems with 100Gbps connections with model parallel.

TL;DR: FedRAC通过反转PPO的更新顺序（先actor后critic）解决了联邦强化学习中数据异构导致的收敛问题，理论证明其在温和条件下对数据异构免疫，实验证明其在多种环境中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦强化学习（FRL）中，传统的PPO更新顺序（先critic后actor）因数据异构性导致客户端梯度方向不一致，阻碍全局最优策略的收敛。

Method: 提出FedRAC算法，反转PPO的更新顺序（先actor后critic），以消除不同客户端critic的差异。

Result: 理论分析表明FedRAC在温和条件下对数据异构免疫；实验证明其在五个任务（包括经典RL环境和异构自动驾驶场景）中累积奖励更高、收敛更快。

Conclusion: FedRAC通过调整更新顺序有效解决了FRL中的数据异构问题，为联邦强化学习提供了更鲁棒的优化框架。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), applying Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) faces challenges related to the update order of its
actor and critic due to the aggregation step occurring between successive
iterations. In particular, when local actors are updated based on local critic
estimations, the algorithm becomes vulnerable to data heterogeneity. As a
result, the conventional update order in PPO (critic first, then actor) may
cause heterogeneous gradient directions among clients, hindering convergence to
a globally optimal policy. To address this issue, we propose FedRAC, which
reverses the update order (actor first, then critic) to eliminate the
divergence of critics from different clients. Theoretical analysis shows that
the convergence bound of FedRAC is immune to data heterogeneity under mild
conditions, i.e., bounded level of heterogeneity and accurate policy
evaluation. Empirical results indicate that the proposed algorithm obtains
higher cumulative rewards and converges more rapidly in five experiments,
including three classical RL environments and a highly heterogeneous autonomous
driving scenario using the SUMO traffic simulator.

Motivation: 现有时间序列数据质量评估方法局限于单一领域，难以应对现实世界中跨领域数据的多样性需求。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上验证，TSRating在准确性、效率和领域适应性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TSRating为跨领域时间序列数据质量评估提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model
performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable.
Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual
domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as
influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics.
However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly
different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and
efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a
novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled
from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit
ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to
comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this
assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from
LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed
TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via
TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability,
we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons
collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ
signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of
hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets
across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS
foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of
estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

Motivation: 现有大型预训练模型在语义记忆建模方面表现优异，但支持情景记忆的关联结构形成机制尚未充分探索。受海马CA3区在关联记忆中的作用启发，作者旨在开发一种生物启发的计算框架。

Method: 提出LSHN框架：1）语义编码器提取紧凑潜在表征；2）潜在Hopfield网络通过吸引子收敛进行关联优化；3）解码器重建感知输入。采用端到端梯度下降训练，区别于传统Hopfield网络。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和模拟情景记忆任务中，LSHN在遮挡和噪声条件下的损坏输入回忆任务上表现优异，超越现有关联记忆模型。

Conclusion: 该工作从计算角度揭示了生物基础吸引子机制如何动态绑定语义元素形成情景记忆痕迹，为记忆建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: Episodic memory enables humans to recall past experiences by associating
semantic elements such as objects, locations, and time into coherent event
representations. While large pretrained models have shown remarkable progress
in modeling semantic memory, the mechanisms for forming associative structures
that support episodic memory remain underexplored. Inspired by hippocampal CA3
dynamics and its role in associative memory, we propose the Latent Structured
Hopfield Network (LSHN), a biologically inspired framework that integrates
continuous Hopfield attractor dynamics into an autoencoder architecture. LSHN
mimics the cortical-hippocampal pathway: a semantic encoder extracts compact
latent representations, a latent Hopfield network performs associative
refinement through attractor convergence, and a decoder reconstructs perceptual
input. Unlike traditional Hopfield networks, our model is trained end-to-end
with gradient descent, achieving scalable and robust memory retrieval.
Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a simulated episodic memory task
demonstrate superior performance in recalling corrupted inputs under occlusion
and noise, outperforming existing associative memory models. Our work provides
a computational perspective on how semantic elements can be dynamically bound
into episodic memory traces through biologically grounded attractor mechanisms.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过模型压缩技术减少神经网络训练时的电力消耗，发现隐写容量削减技术能显著降低能耗，而剪枝和低秩分解则效果不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络架构日益复杂，其训练过程消耗大量电力，带来潜在环境影响。尽管已有研究表明大型预训练模型存在冗余，但此前工作主要关注性能保持，对电力消耗的直接影响研究较少。

Method: 研究选取9个参数量从8M到138M的预训练模型，首先记录未压缩模型的训练耗电和时间作为基线，随后应用隐写容量削减、剪枝和低秩分解三种压缩技术，并对比压缩后的能耗、训练时间和准确率等指标。

Result: 实验表明，剪枝和低秩分解对能耗等指标无显著改善，而隐写容量削减在几乎所有案例中都能大幅降低电力消耗。

Conclusion: 模型压缩可作为降低AI训练电力消耗的有效手段，其中隐写容量削减技术展现出显著优势，这对减少深度学习的环境影响具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: Increasingly complex neural network architectures have achieved phenomenal
performance. However, these complex models require massive computational
resources that consume substantial amounts of electricity, which highlights the
potential environmental impact of such models. Previous studies have
demonstrated that substantial redundancies exist in large pre-trained models.
However, previous work has primarily focused on compressing models while
retaining comparable model performance, and the direct impact on electricity
consumption appears to have received relatively little attention. By
quantifying the energy usage associated with both uncompressed and compressed
models, we investigate compression as a means of reducing electricity
consumption. We consider nine different pre-trained models, ranging in size
from 8M parameters to 138M parameters. To establish a baseline, we first train
each model without compression and record the electricity usage and time
required during training, along with other relevant statistics. We then apply
three compression techniques: Steganographic capacity reduction, pruning, and
low-rank factorization. In each of the resulting cases, we again measure the
electricity usage, training time, model accuracy, and so on. We find that
pruning and low-rank factorization offer no significant improvements with
respect to energy usage or other related statistics, while steganographic
capacity reduction provides major benefits in almost every case. We discuss the
significance of these findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在两个缺陷：样本级评估忽略令牌级信息量，且评分方法缺乏鲁棒性（易受表面词汇特征干扰）。

Method: 提出T-SHIRT框架：1) 新评分方法仅纳入信息量高的令牌；2) 通过邻居样本质量一致性提升选择鲁棒性。

Result: 在8个基准测试中平均提升5.48分，GPT-2评分下52k数据仅需40分钟（单GPU）。

Conclusion: T-SHIRT在成本效益和效果上均优于现有技术，适用于不同规模LLMs。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to
effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce
data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g.,
Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality
instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data
selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the
performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key
limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level
informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method,
often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its
true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data
Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework
that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in
quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose
neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We
demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the
original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire
large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks.
Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses
existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both
cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score
computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes
on a single GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器遗忘技术存在两个盲点：过度遗忘会损害保留数据，而重新学习攻击可能恢复遗忘的知识。

Method: 引入Spotter方法，结合掩码知识蒸馏惩罚和类内分散损失，抑制过度遗忘并防止重新学习攻击。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，Spotter显著降低过度遗忘，遗忘准确率降至0%，保留集准确率差异小于1%，有效抵御原型攻击。

Conclusion: Spotter是解决机器遗忘盲点的实用方案，无需访问保留数据即可实现高效遗忘和防护。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a
trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook
two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data
near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect
the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric
OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of
the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an
unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack,
which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few
samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both
blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i)
a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to
suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters
forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On
CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the
0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the
retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the
prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without
accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the
unlearning's blind spots.

Result: 在布局到图像生成、数量感知生成和审美偏好生成等任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 后验采样初始化显著提升对齐性能，pCNL算法支持高维潜空间的高效采样。

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based
initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a
score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based
generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader
paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of
this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising
process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the
Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results
in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the
reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable
posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines
dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach
enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves
performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image
generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as
demonstrated in our experiments.

Motivation: 现有的联邦类增量学习方法在数据异构性下难以避免客户端漂移，且通信和计算开销大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出STSA方法，通过空间（跨客户端）和时间（跨阶段）聚合特征统计量，避免数据异构性影响，并引入通信高效的STSA-E变体。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的FCIL数据集上，STSA在性能、灵活性和通信计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STSA为联邦类增量学习提供了高效统一的解决方案，显著提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental
Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate
old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods
cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and
often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting
practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a
novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides
a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across
clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are
unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in
closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a
communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar
performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive
experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data
heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods
in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation
efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating
data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally,
this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic
Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external
control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability
into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they
often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be
suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into
more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce
NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion
Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a
dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate
the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive
probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach
enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned
structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be
conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior,
thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our
experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that
lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional
inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random
initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation,
which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks
like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning. Our code will be

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不变风险最小化(IRM)的鲁棒性机器遗忘方法ILU，能有效抵御下游微调导致的知识恢复问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型(LLM)的遗忘方法对下游微调高度敏感，容易导致已遗忘知识被重新激活。为解决这一问题，研究首次将不变性引入遗忘领域。

Method: 提出基于正则化的ILU框架，通过引入不变风险最小化原理增强模型鲁棒性，仅需单数据集训练即可泛化至多种微调任务。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，ILU显著优于NPO和RMU等先进方法，在数学、复述检测、情感分析等下游任务中均保持优异的遗忘鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ILU首次将不变性引入机器遗忘领域，为LLM提供了一种能抵御下游微调干扰的鲁棒性知识移除方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning offers a promising solution to privacy and safety concerns
in large language models (LLMs) by selectively removing targeted knowledge
while preserving utility. However, current methods are highly sensitive to
downstream fine-tuning, which can quickly recover forgotten information-even
from unrelated tasks. To address this, we introduce invariance into unlearning
for the first time, inspired by invariant risk minimization (IRM). Building on
this principle, we propose invariant LLM unlearning (ILU), a
regularization-based framework that enhances robustness. Notably, ILU
generalizes well to diverse fine-tuning tasks, even when trained using a single
dataset. A task vector analysis is also provided to further elucidate the
rationale behind ILU's effectiveness. Extensive experiments on the WMDP and
MUSE benchmark, reveal that ILU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
unlearning methods, including negative preference optimization (NPO) and
representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU). Notably, ILU achieves
superior unlearning robustness across diverse downstream fine-tuning scenarios
(e.g., math, paraphrase detection, and sentiment analysis) while preserving the
fine-tuning performance.

Motivation: 传统Cox回归对数据分布假设敏感，易受模型误设和数据扰动影响。本文旨在通过分布鲁棒学习增强模型的稳定性和预测精度。

Method: 采用Wasserstein距离构建模糊集的DRL框架，将原min-max问题转化为可处理的基于指数锥规划的凸优化问题，提出DRL-Cox模型。

Result: 理论证明了有限样本性能保证，模拟和实际案例表明该方法在预测精度和鲁棒性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: DRL-Cox模型有效降低了分布假设依赖性，显著提升了生存分析的鲁棒性和预测性能。

Abstract: We introduce an innovative approach that incorporates a Distributionally
Robust Learning (DRL) approach into Cox regression to enhance the robustness
and accuracy of survival predictions. By formulating a DRL framework with a
Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set, we develop a variant Cox model that
is less sensitive to assumptions about the underlying data distribution and
more resilient to model misspecification and data perturbations. By leveraging
Wasserstein duality, we reformulate the original min-max DRL problem into a
tractable regularized empirical risk minimization problem, which can be
computed by exponential conic programming. We provide guarantees on the finite
sample behavior of our DRL-Cox model. Moreover, through extensive simulations
and real world case studies, we demonstrate that our regression model achieves
superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness compared
with traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNN的内部状态中的噪声和dropout已被证实是稳定因素，但之前的研究是分开进行的。本文旨在通过变分推断将它们统一起来，并优化其比例。

Method: 将RNN的优化问题重新解释为变分推断，将显式正则化项转化为隐式正则化，同时推导出噪声和dropout，并调整其比例。

Result: 在移动机械臂的模仿学习场景中，只有VAND能够按照指令模仿序列和周期性行为。

Conclusion: VAND通过变分推断统一了噪声和dropout，优化了RNN的稳定性，并在模仿学习中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel stable learning theory for recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), so-called variational adaptive noise and dropout (VAND). As
stabilizing factors for RNNs, noise and dropout on the internal state of RNNs
have been separately confirmed in previous studies. We reinterpret the
optimization problem of RNNs as variational inference, showing that noise and
dropout can be derived simultaneously by transforming the explicit
regularization term arising in the optimization problem into implicit
regularization. Their scale and ratio can also be adjusted appropriately to
optimize the main objective of RNNs, respectively. In an imitation learning
scenario with a mobile manipulator, only VAND is able to imitate sequential and
periodic behaviors as instructed. https://youtu.be/UOho3Xr6A2w

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TAH-Quant方法，通过细粒度分块量化和自适应位分配，解决分布式训练中激活值通信瓶颈问题，在保持收敛性的同时实现4.3倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练大语言模型时，流水线并行导致中间激活值频繁通信，在带宽有限时成为瓶颈。现有量化方法虽能压缩激活值，但存在内存开销大或误差累积问题。

Method: 提出TAH-Quant框架：1) 分块量化精细控制误差；2) 基于熵的token级自适应比特分配；3) 哈达玛变换结合主元交换抑制量化异常值。理论证明其收敛速率与标准SGD相同。

Result: 实验表明：1) 实现3-4比特激进量化；2) 端到端加速4.3倍；3) 不影响模型收敛；4) 零额外内存开销；5) 泛化性强于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAH-Quant有效解决了流水线并行中的激活值通信瓶颈，为分布式训练大模型提供了高效、内存友好的量化方案。

Abstract: Decentralized training of large language models offers the opportunity to
pool computational resources across geographically distributed participants but
faces significant network communication bottlenecks, particularly in
pipeline-parallel settings. While pipeline parallelism partitions model layers
across devices to handle large-scale models, it necessitates frequent
communication of intermediate activations, creating challenges when network
bandwidth is limited. Existing activation compression methods, such as AQ-SGD,
mitigate quantization-induced errors through error compensation but impose
prohibitive memory overhead by requiring storage of previous activations. To
address these issues, we introduce TAH-Quant (Tile-wise Adaptive Hadamard
Quantization), a novel activation quantization framework designed specifically
for pipeline parallelism. Our approach integrates fine-grained tile-wise
quantization for precise control, entropy-guided token-level adaptive bit
allocation for optimal bit usage, and a Hadamard-based transform with pivot
element swapping to effectively suppress quantization outliers. We further
provide a theoretical analysis, proving that pipeline parallel training
equipped with TAH-Quant maintains a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, matching that of vanilla stochastic gradient
descent. Extensive experiments on diverse LLM tasks demonstrate that TAH-Quant
achieves aggressive activation quantization (3-4 bits) ratio, which provides up
to 4.3$\times$ end-to-end speedup without compromising training convergence,
matches state-of-the-art methods, incurs no extra memory overhead, and
generalizes well across different training scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，用于联合合成控制器和Lyapunov函数，显著减少了训练中的保守性，并提高了验证速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于学习的神经网络控制策略在实证中表现出色，但由于缺乏稳定且可扩展的训练和验证算法，获取这些学习到的神经控制器的稳定性保证和吸引区域估计仍然具有挑战性。现有工作虽然取得了一定成功，但其框架中仍存在较多的保守性。

Method: 论文提出了一种两阶段训练框架，通过利用Zubov启发的吸引区域表征直接估计稳定性边界，采用新颖的训练数据采样策略和域更新机制。此外，论文扩展了神经网络验证器α,β-CROWN的能力，使其能够通过动态系统的Jacobian进行自动边界传播，并采用了一种避免昂贵二分法的新验证方案。

Result: 实验表明，该训练方法能够产生比基线方法大5至1.5×10^5倍的吸引区域体积，且在连续系统上的验证速度比传统SMT求解器dReal快40至10000倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法在减少训练保守性和提高验证效率方面取得了显著成效，为神经网络控制器的稳定性和可验证性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based neural network (NN) control policies have shown impressive
empirical performance. However, obtaining stability guarantees and estimations
of the region of attraction of these learned neural controllers is challenging
due to the lack of stable and scalable training and verification algorithms.
Although previous works in this area have achieved great success, much
conservatism remains in their framework. In this work, we propose a novel
two-stage training framework to jointly synthesize the controller and Lyapunov
function for continuous-time systems. By leveraging a Zubov-inspired region of
attraction characterization to directly estimate stability boundaries, we
propose a novel training data sampling strategy and a domain updating mechanism
that significantly reduces the conservatism in training. Moreover, unlike
existing works on continuous-time systems that rely on an SMT solver to
formally verify the Lyapunov condition, we extend state-of-the-art neural
network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN with the capability of performing
automatic bound propagation through the Jacobian of dynamical systems and a
novel verification scheme that avoids expensive bisection. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct numerical experiments by synthesizing
and verifying controllers on several challenging nonlinear systems across
multiple dimensions. We show that our training can yield region of attractions
with volume $5 - 1.5\cdot 10^{5}$ times larger compared to the baselines, and
our verification on continuous systems can be up to $40-10000$ times faster
compared to the traditional SMT solver dReal. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RDB2G-Bench基准框架，用于评估关系数据库到图模型的转换方法，通过预计算数据集加速评估过程，并揭示了影响图模型效果的关键结构模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将关系数据库（RDB）转换为图模型的方法多种多样，但性能差异显著，且缺乏统一的评估标准。为了推动智能RDB到图建模的研究，需要一种高效的基准测试框架。

Method: 作者构建了包含5个真实世界RDB和12个预测任务的大规模数据集，生成了约50k个图-性能对，并在此基础上对9种自动RDB到图建模方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 通过预计算数据集，基准测试速度比实时评估快600倍以上。分析揭示了影响图模型效果的关键结构模式，并提供了实用的图建模建议。

Conclusion: RDB2G-Bench为RDB到图建模的研究提供了高效、可复现的评估框架，其数据集和分析结果对实际应用具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are composed of interconnected tables, where
relationships between them are defined through foreign keys. Recent research on
applying machine learning to RDBs has explored graph-based representations of
RDBs, where rows of tables are modeled as nodes, and foreign key relationships
are modeled as edges. RDB-to-graph modeling helps capture cross-table
dependencies, ultimately leading to enhanced performance across diverse tasks.
However, there are numerous ways to model RDBs as graphs, and performance
varies significantly depending on the chosen graph model. In our analysis,
applying a common heuristic rule for graph modeling leads to up to a 10% drop
in performance compared to the best-performing graph model, which remains
non-trivial to identify. To foster research on intelligent RDB-to-graph
modeling, we introduce RDB2G-Bench, the first benchmark framework for
evaluating such methods. We construct extensive datasets covering 5 real-world
RDBs and 12 predictive tasks, resulting in around 50k graph-performance pairs
for efficient and reproducible evaluations. Thanks to our precomputed datasets,
we were able to benchmark 9 automatic RDB-to-graph modeling methods on the 12
tasks over 600x faster than on-the-fly evaluation, which requires repeated
model training. Our analysis of the datasets and benchmark results reveals key
structural patterns affecting graph model effectiveness, along with practical
implications for effective graph modeling.

Conclusion: TimeGraph为时间序列因果发现提供了全面、可复现的评估工具，支持算法公平透明的比较，并促进该领域的社区驱动进展。

Abstract: Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark
datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets
remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical
temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity
driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the
presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce
TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets
that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while
modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and
heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified
causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is
provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without,
thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving
methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph
through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms
including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and
metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic
performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for
robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal
discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation
scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely
available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven
advancements in time-series causal discovery.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such
data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models
designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use
case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this
issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified
framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation
models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with
spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained
language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and
methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how
foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a
result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains
unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of
previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The
pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal
data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The
pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing
methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and
effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further
illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the
adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a
clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core
elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get
started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as
multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

Conclusion: 自我验证框架为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了新思路，通过单一强化学习过程实现生成与验证的统一。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While
prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external
reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal
gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning
tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution
discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general
reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to
self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification
within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can
effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model
can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its
generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our
self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying
reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning
benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance
but also enable effective test-time scaling. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LLM引导的推理能有效改造编译器优化领域，通过上下文感知决策提升样本效率和性能。

Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of
serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread
accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven
substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with
neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space
of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can
be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the
structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate
the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs),
without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of
compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end,
we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that
formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided
by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The
LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations
that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback.
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to
balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured,
context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By
achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural
compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to
transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

Conclusion: GlycanAA和PreGlycanAA模型通过全原子级别的糖链建模和预训练技术，显著提升了糖链性质预测的准确性，为糖科学研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Understanding the various properties of glycans with machine learning has
shown some preliminary promise. However, previous methods mainly focused on
modeling the backbone structure of glycans as graphs of monosaccharides (i.e.,
sugar units), while they neglected the atomic structures underlying each
monosaccharide, which are actually important indicators of glycan properties.
We fill this blank by introducing the GlycanAA model for All-Atom-wise Glycan
modeling. GlycanAA models a glycan as a heterogeneous graph with monosaccharide
nodes representing its global backbone structure and atom nodes representing
its local atomic-level structures. Based on such a graph, GlycanAA performs
hierarchical message passing to capture from local atomic-level interactions to
global monosaccharide-level interactions. To further enhance model capability,
we pre-train GlycanAA on a high-quality unlabeled glycan dataset, deriving the
PreGlycanAA model. We design a multi-scale mask prediction algorithm to endow
the model about different levels of dependencies in a glycan. Extensive
benchmark results show the superiority of GlycanAA over existing glycan
encoders and verify the further improvements achieved by PreGlycanAA. We
maintain all resources at https://github.com/kasawa1234/GlycanAA

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为'深度编辑'的新模型编辑方法，旨在解决现有技术在处理关联事实时的不足，并引入了ThinkEval框架和KnowGIC基准来评估编辑技术对知识连贯性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型编辑技术通常针对孤立事实进行修改，忽视了关联知识的连锁反应，导致编辑后的知识仍可通过原有逻辑推导出来，破坏了上下文的整体一致性。

Method: 论文提出了'深度编辑'的概念，并开发了ThinkEval框架来构建模型特定的知识图谱，以分析编辑前后对事实持久性和灾难性遗忘的影响。同时，创建了KnowGIC基准来系统评估五种编辑技术。

Result: 评估发现，现有的编辑技术（如AlphaEdit、ROME等）难以平衡间接事实抑制与相关知识保留之间的关系，显示出在处理关联知识连贯性方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前模型编辑技术需要改进以更好地处理知识间的关联性，ThinkEval和KnowGIC为未来编辑技术的发展提供了有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Model editing has become an important tool for addressing privacy, bias, and
misinformation in large language models (LLMs) by enabling updates to knowledge
without the need for retraining from scratch. However, existing editing
techniques often target isolated facts, ignoring ripple effects on related
knowledge, allowing edited facts to remain deducible and compromising broader
contextual integrity. For example, changing Harry Potter's school from Hogwarts
to Ilvermorny requires reassigning his house from Gryffindor to a suitable
alternative while preserving Gryffindor's relationship with Hogwarts. In this
work, we present a new model-editing setting, deep editing, to show: (1) how
editing techniques fail to handle connected facts, evaluating how original
knowledge sneaks through unchanged causal links, and (2) their impact on
broader contextual knowledge. We introduce ThinkEval, a framework to
systematically evaluate model-editing techniques by building model-specific
knowledge graphs to analyze pre- and post-edit effects on fact persistence and
catastrophic forgetting. We present KnowGIC, a benchmark created with
ThinkEval, consisting of sequentially linked queries to measure these effects.
We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE
across multiple LLMs. We find that these techniques struggle to balance
indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge. Our
dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowGIC.

paradigms relying on monolithic GPU clusters become increasingly unsustainable.
This paper proposes a distributed system architecture that partitions a neural
network across multiple servers, each responsible for a subset of neurons.
Neurons are classified as local or remote, with inter-server connections
managed via a metadata-driven lookup mechanism. A Multi-Part Neural Network
Execution Engine facilitates seamless execution and training across distributed
partitions by dynamically resolving and invoking remote neurons using stored
metadata. All servers share a unified model through a network file system
(NFS), ensuring consistency during parallel updates. A Neuron Distributor
module enables flexible partitioning strategies based on neuron count,
percentage, identifiers, or network layers. This architecture enables
cost-effective, scalable deployment of deep learning models on cloud
infrastructure, reducing dependency on high-performance centralized compute
resources.

### [501] [Improved Regret Bounds for Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound in Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01393)
*Shogo Iwazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过改进GP-UCB算法的分析，在Matérn核和平方指数核下分别实现了更优的遗憾上界，填补了现有理论与最优界之间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究贝叶斯优化问题中高斯过程上置信界（GP-UCB）算法的遗憾上界，旨在缩小现有理论与Scarlett（2018）提出的最优界之间的差距。

Method: 通过分析GP-UCB算法实现的输入序列的集中行为，对高斯过程的信息增益进行更精细的分析。

Result: 在Matérn核下实现了$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$的累计遗憾，在平方指数核下实现了$O(\sqrt{T \ln^4 T})$的遗憾。

Conclusion: 论文通过改进分析技术，显著提升了GP-UCB算法的遗憾上界，填补了理论空白。

Abstract: This paper addresses the Bayesian optimization problem (also referred to as
the Bayesian setting of the Gaussian process bandit), where the learner seeks
to minimize the regret under a function drawn from a known Gaussian process
(GP). Under a Mat\'ern kernel with a certain degree of smoothness, we show that
the Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret with high probability. Furthermore, our
analysis yields $O(\sqrt{T \ln^4 T})$ regret under a squared exponential
kernel. These results fill the gap between the existing regret upper bound for
GP-UCB and the best-known bound provided by Scarlett (2018). The key idea in
our proof is to capture the concentration behavior of the input sequence
realized by GP-UCB, enabling a more refined analysis of the GP's information
gain.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种有界自适应裁剪方法，解决了差分隐私学习中梯度裁剪对少数群体预测的不均衡影响问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私学习方法在模型预测上存在不均衡影响，尤其是对少数群体。自适应梯度裁剪会过度抑制大梯度，导致少数群体准确率显著下降。

Method: 提出有界自适应裁剪方法，通过引入可调下限防止梯度过度抑制。

Result: 在倾斜MNIST和Fashion MNIST数据集上，相比无界自适应裁剪，最差类别准确率平均提升超过10个百分点；相比固定裁剪提升超过5个百分点。

Conclusion: 有界自适应裁剪能有效缓解差分隐私学习中的预测不均衡问题，显著提升少数群体的模型准确率。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become an essential framework for
privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing DP learning methods, however,
often have disparate impacts on model predictions, e.g., for minority groups.
Gradient clipping, which is often used in DP learning, can suppress larger
gradients from challenging samples. We show that this problem is amplified by
adaptive clipping, which will often shrink the clipping bound to tiny values to
match a well-fitting majority, while significantly reducing the accuracy for
others. We propose bounded adaptive clipping, which introduces a tunable lower
bound to prevent excessive gradient suppression. Our method improves the
accuracy of the worst-performing class on average over 10 percentage points on
skewed MNIST and Fashion MNIST compared to the unbounded adaptive clipping, and
over 5 percentage points over constant clipping.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种创新的误差反馈框架，用于减少分布式图滤波中的量化噪声，通过精确补偿量化噪声，显著提高了滤波过程的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式图滤波中，通信受限量化消息会引入量化噪声，影响滤波效果。现有误差补偿方法无法精确量化反馈噪声，因此需要一种更有效的误差反馈机制。

Method: 提出了一种基于误差频谱整形技术的误差反馈框架，通过定量反馈量化噪声实现精确补偿，并在确定性图滤波、随机图滤波和随机节点异步更新三种场景下进行了分析。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，该框架显著降低了量化噪声的影响，提供了最优误差反馈系数的闭式解，并能无缝集成到通信高效的分布式优化框架中，实现更低的误差下限。

Conclusion: 本文提出的误差反馈框架在准确性和鲁棒性上优于传统量化策略，为分布式图滤波中的量化噪声问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative error feedback framework designed to
mitigate quantization noise in distributed graph filtering, where
communications are constrained to quantized messages. It comes from error
spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore
establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different
domains. In contrast to existing error compensation methods, our framework
quantitatively feeds back the quantization noise for exact compensation. We
examine the framework under three key scenarios: (i) deterministic graph
filtering, (ii) graph filtering over random graphs, and (iii) graph filtering
with random node-asynchronous updates. Rigorous theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly reduces the effect of
quantization noise, and we provide closed-form solutions for the optimal error
feedback coefficients. Moreover, this quantitative error feedback mechanism can
be seamlessly integrated into communication-efficient decentralized
optimization frameworks, enabling lower error floors. Numerical experiments
validate the theoretical results, consistently showing that our method
outperforms conventional quantization strategies in terms of both accuracy and
robustness.

*Xiang Zhao,Ruijie Li,Qiao Ning,Shikai Guo,Hui Li,Qian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOC-DGL模型通过两个模块（ADGL和EDGL）有效捕捉药物-靶点相互作用中的相似性信息，并提出了可调节的不平衡损失函数以解决数据不平衡问题，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数模型仅挖掘同质图中的直接相似性信息，忽略了异质图中潜在的丰富相似性信息，限制了药物-靶点相互作用（DTI）预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SOC-DGL模型，包含Affinity-Driven Graph Learning (ADGL)模块和Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL)模块，分别采用全局社交交互策略和高阶社交交互策略，并结合可调节的不平衡损失函数。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，SOC-DGL在数据不平衡和未见药物或靶点的情况下显著提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: SOC-DGL通过综合捕捉不同交互尺度上的相似性信息，并解决数据不平衡问题，显著提升了DTI任务的预测性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The identification of drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug
discovery and repositioning, as it reveals potential uses of existing drugs,
aiding in the acceleration of the drug development process and reducing
associated costs. Despite the similarity information in DTI is important, most
models are limited to mining direct similarity information within homogeneous
graphs, overlooking the potential yet rich similarity information in
heterogeneous graphs. Inspired by real-world social interaction behaviors, we
propose SOC-DGL, which comprises two specialized modules: the Affinity-Driven
Graph Learning (ADGL) module and the Equilibrium-Driven Graph Learning (EDGL)
module. The ADGL module adopts a comprehensive social interaction strategy,
leveraging an affinity-enhanced global drug-target graph to learn both global
DTI and the individual similarity information of drugs and targets. In
contrast, the EDGL module employs a higher-order social interaction strategy,
amplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors through an even-polynomial graph
filter grounded in balance theory, enabling the indirect mining of higher-order
homogeneous information. This dual approach enables SOC-DGL to effectively and
comprehensively capture similarity information across diverse interaction
scales within the affinity matrices and drug-target association matrices,
significantly enhancing the model's generalization capability and predictive
accuracy in DTI tasks. To address the issue of imbalance in drug-target
interaction datasets, this paper proposes an adjustable imbalance loss function
that mitigates the impact of sample imbalance by adjusting the weight of
negative samples and a parameter. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate significant accuracy improvements achieved by SOC-DGL,
particularly in scenarios involving data imbalance and unseen drugs or targets.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches process data in a layer-by-layer way with
intermediate (or latent) features. We aim at designing a general solution to
optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification,
segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models.
This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered
embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called
\textbf{nebula anchors}, that guide the latent variables to form clusters
during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we
employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an
anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we
refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be
labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a
self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a
consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which
adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, \textit{e.g.} the
categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be
used within different architectures designed to solve different problems
including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data,
validating the advantage of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的后门攻击防御方法，能够在无需干净数据集的情况下检测并清除训练数据中的恶意样本，同时提高攻击触发器的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门攻击防御方法通常依赖干净数据集来统计异常，但在现实场景中，数据集可能不可用或已被污染。因此，需要一种不依赖干净数据集的防御方法。

Method: 论文提出的方法通过在给定数据集上训练模型，检测被污染的类别，提取攻击触发器的关键部分，并识别被污染的实例。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在知名图像数据集上有效，并在与SCAn、ABL和AGPD三种先进算法的比较中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了后门攻击防御的有效性，还通过明确揭示触发器的有害部分增强了可解释性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks
targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves
normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker
embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the
training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training
data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The
objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label
while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense
mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these
methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute
statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios
where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset,
detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger
before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances
explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on
well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three
state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

TL;DR: 论文提出ShaTS方法，通过改进Shapley值解释技术，提升时间序列模型异常检测的解释精度和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网环境中，现有异常检测解释方法常忽略时间序列的时序特性，导致解释不精确或不可操作。

Method: 提出ShaTS（时间序列模型的Shapley值），一种模型无关的解释方法，通过特征分组策略保留时序依赖关系。

Result: 在SWaT数据集上实验表明，ShaTS能准确识别关键时间点、异常影响的传感器/执行器，且在解释性和资源效率上优于SHAP。

Conclusion: ShaTS满足工业环境实时性需求，为时序模型提供更精准、可操作的异常解释。

Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced
Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate
cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of
data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly
Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time
windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional
explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise
or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for
Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial
Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value
explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of
traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy
that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable
insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS
accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors,
actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms
of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time
requirements of industrial environments.

Motivation: 现有超图生成方法仅关注拓扑结构，忽视了节点和超边特征的重要性，而实际应用中特征建模同样关键。

Method: FAHNES通过节点粗化构建多尺度表示，利用局部扩展和细化重建更精细层级，并引入节点预算机制控制簇分裂。

Result: 在合成超图、3D网格和分子数据集上，FAHNES在重建拓扑和特征方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FAHNES为带特征超图生成建模奠定了研究基础，未来可进一步探索相关应用。

Abstract: Hypergraphs generalize traditional graphs by allowing hyperedges to connect
multiple nodes, making them well-suited for modeling complex structures with
higher-order relationships, such as 3D meshes, molecular systems, and
electronic circuits. While topology is central to hypergraph structure, many
real-world applications also require node and hyperedge features. Existing
hypergraph generation methods focus solely on topology, often overlooking
feature modeling. In this work, we introduce FAHNES (feature-aware hypergraph
generation via next-scale prediction), a hierarchical approach that jointly
generates hypergraph topology and features. FAHNES builds a multi-scale
representation through node coarsening, then learns to reconstruct finer levels
via localized expansion and refinement, guided by a new node budget mechanism
that controls cluster splitting. We evaluate FAHNES on synthetic hypergraphs,
3D meshes, and molecular datasets. FAHNES achieves competitive results in
reconstructing topology and features, establishing a foundation for future
research in featured hypergraph generative modeling.

Abstract: Understanding the interaction between different drugs (drug-drug interaction

overlooking multimodal data that reflect complex drug mechanisms. In this
paper, we (1) introduce MUDI, a large-scale Multimodal biomedical dataset for

multimodal representation of drugs by combining pharmacological text, chemical
formulas, molecular structure graphs, and images across 310,532 annotated drug
pairs labeled as Synergism, Antagonism, or New Effect. Crucially, to
effectively evaluate machine-learning based generalization, MUDI consists of
unseen drug pairs in the test set. We evaluate benchmark models using both late
fusion voting and intermediate fusion strategies. All data, annotations,
evaluation scripts, and baselines are released under an open research license.

Abstract: Stage lighting plays an essential role in live music performances,
influencing the engaging experience of both musicians and audiences. Given the
high costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers,
Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention.
However, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories
and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and
monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this issue, this paper
presents an end-to-end solution that directly learns from experienced lighting
engineers -- Skip-BART. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification
problem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and
produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip
connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within
the frame grid.We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an
human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional
rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap
compared to real lighting engineers.Specifically, our method yields a p-value
of 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human
lighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human
lighting engineering performance. To support further research, we have made our
self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at

TL;DR: 该论文针对回归任务中的数据不平衡问题，提出新的采样技术和相关函数，并通过集成学习方法减少对常见样本性能的负面影响，最终证明其crbSMOGN采样技术结合密度比相关函数在神经网络中表现最佳。


<details>

Motivation: 数据不平衡在回归任务中普遍存在，会导致模型性能偏差并降低预测可靠性，特别是在预测罕见事件时问题更为突出。

Method: 论文提出密度-距离和密度-比相关函数来评估数据重要性，并改进现有采样方法（cSMOGN和crbSMOGN），同时采用集成学习方法结合有无不平衡缓解的模型。

Result: 实验表明，多数策略能提升罕见样本性能但会降低常见样本性能，而集成方法能显著减少负面影响，crbSMOGN采样技术结合密度-比相关函数在神经网络中表现最优。

Conclusion: 论文提出的crbSMOGN采样技术和密度-比相关函数能有效缓解数据不平衡问题，尤其在神经网络中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data imbalance persists as a pervasive challenge in regression tasks,
introducing bias in model performance and undermining predictive reliability.
This is particularly detrimental in applications aimed at predicting rare
events that fall outside the domain of the bulk of the training data. In this
study, we review the current state-of-the-art regarding sampling-based methods
and cost-sensitive learning. Additionally, we propose novel approaches to
mitigate model bias. To better asses the importance of data, we introduce the
density-distance and density-ratio relevance functions, which effectively
integrate empirical frequency of data with domain-specific preferences,
offering enhanced interpretability for end-users. Furthermore, we present
advanced mitigation techniques (cSMOGN and crbSMOGN), which build upon and
improve existing sampling methods. In a comprehensive quantitative evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art methods on 10 synthetic and 42 real-world
datasets, using neural networks, XGBoosting trees and Random Forest models. Our
analysis reveals that while most strategies improve performance on rare
samples, they often degrade it on frequent ones. We demonstrate that
constructing an ensemble of models -- one trained with imbalance mitigation and
another without -- can significantly reduce these negative effects. The key
findings underscore the superior performance of our novel crbSMOGN sampling
technique with the density-ratio relevance function for neural networks,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CASD策略有效提升了多模态情感分析在模态缺失情况下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human sentiment
through multimodal data. In real-world scenarios, practical factors often lead
to uncertain modality missingness. Existing methods for handling modality
missingness are based on data reconstruction or common subspace projections.
However, these methods neglect the confidence in multimodal combinations and
impose constraints on intra-class representation, hindering the capture of
modality-specific information and resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Self-Distillation
(CASD) strategy that effectively incorporates multimodal probabilistic
embeddings via a mixture of Student's $t$-distributions, enhancing its
robustness by incorporating confidence and accommodating heavy-tailed
properties. This strategy estimates joint distributions with uncertainty scores
and reduces uncertainty in the student network by consistency distillation.
Furthermore, we introduce a reparameterization representation module that
facilitates CASD in robust multimodal learning by sampling embeddings from the
joint distribution for the prediction module to calculate the task loss. As a
result, the directional constraint from the loss minimization is alleviated by
the sampled representation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: iJKOnet通过结合JKO框架和逆优化技术，提供了一种灵活且高效的学习群体动态的方法，无需限制性架构选择，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning population dynamics involves recovering the underlying process that
governs particle evolution, given evolutionary snapshots of samples at discrete
time points. Recent methods frame this as an energy minimization problem in
probability space and leverage the celebrated JKO scheme for efficient time
discretization. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{iJKOnet}$, an approach that
combines the JKO framework with inverse optimization techniques to learn
population dynamics. Our method relies on a conventional $\textit{end-to-end}$
adversarial training procedure and does not require restrictive architectural
choices, e.g., input-convex neural networks. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our methodology and demonstrate improved performance over prior
JKO-based methods.

Conclusion: 该方法使训练独立于目标标签，可能实现无转录音频数据的蒸馏，为高效语音识别模型提供新思路。

Abstract: With the rise of large pre-trained foundation models for automatic speech
recognition new challenges appear. While the performance of these models is
good, runtime and cost of inference increases. One approach to make use of
their strength while retaining efficiency is to distill their knowledge to
smaller models during training. In this work, we explore different CTC-based
distillation variants, focusing on blank token handling. We show that common
approaches like blank elimination do not always work off the shelf. We explore
new blank selection patterns as a potential sweet spot between standard
knowledge distillation and blank elimination mechanisms. Through the
introduction of a symmetric selection method, we are able to remove the CTC
loss during knowledge distillation with minimal to no performance degradation.
With this, we make the training independent from target labels, potentially
allowing for distillation on untranscribed audio data.

Conclusion: 正则化FIF可视为具有灵活后验的VAE变体，在保持计算效率的同时突破了对角协方差的表征限制。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models widely used
for learning interpretable latent spaces, quantifying uncertainty, and
compressing data for downstream generative tasks. VAEs typically rely on
diagonal Gaussian posteriors due to computational constraints. Using arguments
grounded in differential geometry, we demonstrate inherent limitations in the
representational capacity of diagonal covariance VAEs, as illustrated by
explicit low-dimensional examples. In response, we show that a regularized
variant of the recently introduced Free-form Injective Flow (FIF) can be
interpreted as a VAE featuring a highly flexible, implicitly defined posterior.
Crucially, this regularization yields a posterior equivalent to a full Gaussian
covariance distribution, yet maintains computational costs comparable to
standard diagonal covariance VAEs. Experiments on image datasets validate our
approach, demonstrating that incorporating full covariance substantially
improves model likelihood.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分布学习的对齐方法，替代传统RLHF，通过显式建模目标语言模型的信息泄露，提出三种新目标函数，理论证明其收敛性，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法缺乏理论依据且易导致退化确定性解，其变体（如DPO）也存在类似问题。作者认为应从分布学习角度重新思考对齐问题。

Method: 提出三种基于分布学习的对齐目标函数：偏好最大似然估计、偏好蒸馏和反向KL最小化，显式建模偏好数据中的目标模型信息。

Result: 理论证明三种方法均具有O(1/n)收敛性，实验显示其性能稳定优于或匹配RLHF和DPO，尤其偏好蒸馏表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过分布学习框架重新定义对齐问题，提出的方法在理论和实证上均优于传统RLHF范式，解决了退化与奖励过拟合问题。

Abstract: Alignment via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become
the dominant paradigm for controlling the quality of outputs from large
language models (LLMs). However, when viewed as `loss + regularization,' the
standard RLHF objective lacks theoretical justification and incentivizes
degenerate, deterministic solutions, an issue that variants such as Direct
Policy Optimization (DPO) also inherit. In this paper, we rethink alignment by
framing it as \emph{distribution learning} from pairwise preference feedback by
explicitly modeling how information about the target language model bleeds
through the preference data. This explicit modeling leads us to propose three
principled learning objectives: preference maximum likelihood estimation,
preference distillation, and reverse KL minimization. We theoretically show
that all three approaches enjoy strong non-asymptotic $O(1/n)$ convergence to
the target language model, naturally avoiding degeneracy and reward
overfitting. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our distribution learning
framework, especially preference distillation, consistently outperforms or
matches the performances of RLHF and DPO across various tasks and models.

Motivation: 学习MDP的有意义抽象模型对从有限数据中提升泛化能力至关重要。现有方法缺乏对几何先验的有效利用，难以捕捉环境中的对称性和不变性。

Method: 通过在学习的转移模型的低维表示流形上施加几何先验，结合对称结构的潜在空间和群作用，同时嵌入非结构化信息。

Abstract: Learning meaningful abstract models of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is
crucial for improving generalization from limited data. In this work, we show
how geometric priors can be imposed on the low-dimensional representation
manifold of a learned transition model. We incorporate known symmetric
structures via appropriate choices of the latent space and the associated group
actions, which encode prior knowledge about invariances in the environment. In
addition, our framework allows the embedding of additional unstructured
information alongside these symmetries. We show experimentally that this leads
to better predictions of the latent transition model than fully unstructured
approaches, as well as better learning on downstream RL tasks, in environments
with rotational and translational features, including in first-person views of
3D environments. Additionally, our experiments show that this leads to simpler
and more disentangled representations. The full code is available on GitHub to
ensure reproducibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的新方法DIME，用于学习医学治疗中多维结果的联合分布，解决了现有方法仅关注单一结果的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学治疗常影响多个相互依赖的结果（如主要终点、并发症等），但现有机器学习方法多聚焦于单一结果预测，无法满足临床决策中对多维结果联合分布的需求。

Method: DIME通过因果掩码解决因果推断问题，将联合分布分解为条件分布序列，并采用自回归生成预测，支持混合类型数据（二分类/分类/连续变量）且能捕捉结果间依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明DIME能有效学习联合分布并捕获多结果间的共享信息，提供不确定性量化而不仅是点估计。

Conclusion: DIME是首个针对医学治疗多结果联合分布的神经方法，为临床决策提供了更全面的概率框架。

Abstract: In medicine, treatments often influence multiple, interdependent outcomes,
such as primary endpoints, complications, adverse events, or other secondary
endpoints. Hence, to make optimal treatment decisions, clinicians are
interested in learning the distribution of multi-dimensional treatment
outcomes. However, the vast majority of machine learning methods for predicting
treatment effects focus on single-outcome settings, despite the fact that
medical data often include multiple, interdependent outcomes. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel diffusion-based method called DIME to learn the
joint distribution of multiple outcomes of medical treatments. We addresses
three challenges relevant in medical practice: (i)it is tailored to learn the
joint interventional distribution of multiple medical outcomes, which enables
reliable decision-making with uncertainty quantification rather than relying
solely on point estimates; (ii)it explicitly captures the dependence structure
between outcomes; (iii)it can handle outcomes of mixed type, including binary,
categorical, and continuous variables. In DIME, we take into account the
fundamental problem of causal inference through causal masking. For training,
our method decomposes the joint distribution into a series of conditional
distributions with a customized conditional masking to account for the
dependence structure across outcomes. For inference, our method
auto-regressively generates predictions. This allows our method to move beyond
point estimates of causal quantities and thus learn the joint interventional
distribution. To the best of our knowledge, DIME is the first neural method
tailored to learn the joint, multi-outcome distribution of medical treatments.
Across various experiments, we demonstrate that our method effectively learns
the joint distribution and captures shared information among multiple outcomes.

Conclusion: 牺牲部分理论优雅性以换取策略灵活性，能有效改善扩散模型在少步采样场景下的性能。

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges and benefits of a trainable destruction
process in diffusion samplers -- diffusion-based generative models trained to
sample an unnormalised density without access to data samples. Contrary to the
majority of work that views diffusion samplers as approximations to an
underlying continuous-time model, we view diffusion models as discrete-time
policies trained to produce samples in very few generation steps. We propose to
trade some of the elegance of the underlying theory for flexibility in the
definition of the generative and destruction policies. In particular, we
decouple the generation and destruction variances, enabling both transition
kernels to be learned as unconstrained Gaussian densities. We show that, when
the number of steps is limited, training both generation and destruction
processes results in faster convergence and improved sampling quality on
various benchmarks. Through a robust ablation study, we investigate the design
choices necessary to facilitate stable training. Finally, we show the
scalability of our approach through experiments on GAN latent space sampling
for conditional image generation.

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量训练、微调或元学习，难以高效处理不规则多元时间序列的个性化填补和预测问题。

Method: TV-INRs将隐式神经表示与潜变量模型结合，学习基于信号特定协变量的时间连续生成器函数的分布，仅需一次前向传播即可完成预测。

Abstract: We introduce Temporal Variational Implicit Neural Representations (TV-INRs),
a probabilistic framework for modeling irregular multivariate time series that
enables efficient individualized imputation and forecasting. By integrating
implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn
distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on
signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive
training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate
individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments
demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve
diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient
and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in
low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of
magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.

Method: 使用装箱问题数据集，对比了8种持续学习方法抗灾难性遗忘的能力。

Result: 基于复习的方法显著优于其他方法，遗忘损失仅约7%。

Conclusion: 这些方法适用于流式优化场景中的持续学习。

Abstract: Algorithm selection is commonly used to predict the best solver from a
portfolio per per-instance. In many real scenarios, instances arrive in a
stream: new instances become available over time, while the number of class
labels can also grow as new data distributions arrive downstream. As a result,
the classification model needs to be periodically updated to reflect additional
solvers without catastrophic forgetting of past data. In machine-learning (ML),
this is referred to as Class Incremental Learning (CIL). While commonly
addressed in ML settings, its relevance to algorithm-selection in optimisation
has not been previously studied. Using a bin-packing dataset, we benchmark 8
continual learning methods with respect to their ability to withstand
catastrophic forgetting. We find that rehearsal-based methods significantly
outperform other CIL methods. While there is evidence of forgetting, the loss
is small at around 7%. Hence, these methods appear to be a viable approach to
continual learning in streaming optimisation scenarios.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification offers an approach to incorporate the concept of
mistake severity by leveraging a structured, labeled hierarchy. However,
decoding in such settings frequently relies on heuristic decision rules, which
may not align with task-specific evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose a
framework for the optimal decoding of an output probability distribution with
respect to a target metric. We derive optimal decision rules for increasingly
complex prediction settings, providing universal algorithms when candidates are
limited to the set of nodes. In the most general case of predicting a subset of
nodes, we focus on rules dedicated to the hierarchical $hF_{\beta}$ scores,
tailored to hierarchical settings. To demonstrate the practical utility of our
approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations, showcasing the
superiority of our proposed optimal strategies, particularly in underdetermined
scenarios. These results highlight the potential of our methods to enhance the
performance and reliability of hierarchical classifiers in real-world
applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 尽管softmax函数在深度神经网络中广泛应用且效果显著，但其对学习动态和表示学习的影响尚不明确，限制了模型行为的优化能力。

Method: 论文引入了秩不足偏差的概念，分析了softmax函数的logits范数对表示学习的影响，并探讨了如何通过调整softmax温度来利用这一动态。

Result: 研究发现，softmax会导致表示秩远低于类别数的解，通过温度调整可以学习压缩表示或提升分布外数据的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为softmax机制提供了新见解，使深度神经网络中的表示学习获得更好控制。

Abstract: The softmax function is a fundamental building block of deep neural networks,
commonly used to define output distributions in classification tasks or
attention weights in transformer architectures. Despite its widespread use and
proven effectiveness, its influence on learning dynamics and learned
representations remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to optimize
model behavior. In this paper, we study the pivotal role of the softmax
function in shaping the model's representation. We introduce the concept of
rank deficit bias - a phenomenon in which softmax-based deep networks find
solutions of rank much lower than the number of classes. This bias depends on
the softmax function's logits norm, which is implicitly influenced by
hyperparameters or directly modified by softmax temperature. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how to exploit the softmax dynamics to learn compressed
representations or to enhance their performance on out-of-distribution data. We
validate our findings across diverse architectures and real-world datasets,
highlighting the broad applicability of temperature tuning in improving model
performance. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of softmax,
enabling better control over representation learning in deep neural networks.

Conclusion: 课程学习方法有效提高了强化学习中的策略多样性，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task
variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained
diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing
constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as
robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve
diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first
explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our
empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of
skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our
curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

Abstract: This paper introduces a topological framework for interpreting the internal
representations of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We construct a simplicial
tower, a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, that
captures how data topology evolves across network layers. Our approach enables
bi-persistence analysis: layer persistence tracks topological features within
each layer across scales, while MLP persistence reveals how these features
transform through the network. We prove stability theorems for our topological
descriptors and establish that linear separability in latent spaces is related
to disconnected components in the nerve complexes. To make our framework
practical, we develop a combinatorial algorithm for computing MLP persistence
and introduce trajectory-based visualisations that track data flow through the
network. Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical data demonstrate our
method's ability to identify redundant layers, reveal critical topological
transitions, and provide interpretable insights into how MLPs progressively

AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions

allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical
transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory,
we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and
identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly embedded into society through
high-stakes decision-making, selecting the right algorithm for a given task,
audience, and sector presents a critical challenge, particularly in the context
of fairness. Traditional assessments of model fairness have often framed
fairness as an objective mathematical property, treating model selection as an
optimization problem under idealized informational conditions. This overlooks
model multiplicity as a consideration--that multiple models can deliver similar
performance while exhibiting different fairness characteristics. Legal scholars
have engaged this challenge through the concept of Less Discriminatory
Algorithms (LDAs), which frames model selection as a civil rights obligation.
In real-world deployment, this normative challenge is bounded by constraints on
fairness experimentation, e.g., regulatory standards, institutional priorities,
and resource capacity.
  Against these considerations, the paper revisits Lee and Floridi (2021)'s
relational fairness approach using updated 2021 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA) data, and proposes an expansion of the scope of the LDA search process.
We argue that extending the LDA search horizontally, considering fairness
across model families themselves, provides a lightweight complement, or
alternative, to within-model hyperparameter optimization, when operationalizing
fairness in non-experimental, resource constrained settings. Fairness metrics
alone offer useful, but insufficient signals to accurately evaluate candidate
LDAs. Rather, by using a horizontal LDA search approach with the relational
trade-off framework, we demonstrate a responsible minimum viable LDA search on
real-world lending outcomes. Organizations can modify this approach to
systematically compare, evaluate, and select LDAs that optimize fairness and
accuracy in a sector-based contextualized manner.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning has applications in recommendation systems, traffic
forecasting, and social network analysis. Although multiple architectures have
been introduced, progress in positional encoding for temporal graphs remains
limited. Extending static Laplacian eigenvector approaches to temporal graphs
through the supra-Laplacian has shown promise, but also poses key challenges:
high eigendecomposition costs, limited theoretical understanding, and ambiguity
about when and how to apply these encodings. In this paper, we address these
issues by (1) offering a theoretical framework that connects supra-Laplacian
encodings to per-time-slice encodings, highlighting the benefits of leveraging
additional temporal connectivity, (2) introducing novel methods to reduce the
computational overhead, achieving up to 56x faster runtimes while scaling to
graphs with 50,000 active nodes, and (3) conducting an extensive experimental
study to identify which models, tasks, and datasets benefit most from these
encodings. Our findings reveal that while positional encodings can
significantly boost performance in certain scenarios, their effectiveness
varies across different models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies represented in Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) offer powerful representational capabilities. While
second-order optimization methods like Newton's method demonstrate faster
convergence than first-order approaches, current RKHS-based policy optimization
remains constrained to first-order techniques. This limitation stems primarily
from the intractability of explicitly computing and inverting the
infinite-dimensional Hessian operator in RKHS. We introduce Policy Newton in
RKHS, the first second-order optimization framework specifically designed for
RL policies represented in RKHS. Our approach circumvents direct computation of
the inverse Hessian operator by optimizing a cubic regularized auxiliary
objective function. Crucially, we leverage the Representer Theorem to transform
this infinite-dimensional optimization into an equivalent, computationally
tractable finite-dimensional problem whose dimensionality scales with the
trajectory data volume. We establish theoretical guarantees proving convergence
to a local optimum with a local quadratic convergence rate. Empirical
evaluations on a toy financial asset allocation problem validate these
theoretical properties, while experiments on standard RL benchmarks demonstrate

Abstract: Neural operators, which aim to approximate mappings between
infinite-dimensional function spaces, have been widely applied in the
simulation and prediction of physical systems. However, the limited
representational capacity of network architectures, combined with their heavy
reliance on large-scale data, often hinder effective training and result in
poor extrapolation performance. In this paper, inspired by traditional
numerical methods, we propose a novel physics guided multi-step neural operator
(PMNO) architecture to address these challenges in long-horizon prediction of
complex physical systems. Distinct from general operator learning methods, the
PMNO framework replaces the single-step input with multi-step historical data
in the forward pass and introduces an implicit time-stepping scheme based on
the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) during backpropagation. This design
not only strengthens the model's extrapolation capacity but also facilitates
more efficient and stable training with fewer data samples, especially for
long-term predictions. Meanwhile, a causal training strategy is employed to
circumvent the need for multi-stage training and to ensure efficient end-to-end
optimization. The neural operator architecture possesses resolution-invariant
properties, enabling the trained model to perform fast extrapolation on
arbitrary spatial resolutions. We demonstrate the superior predictive
performance of PMNO predictor across a diverse range of physical systems,
including 2D linear system, modeling over irregular domain, complex-valued wave
dynamics, and reaction-diffusion processes. Depending on the specific problem
setting, various neural operator architectures, including FNO, DeepONet, and
their variants, can be seamlessly integrated into the PMNO framework.

Abstract: Neural models learn representations of high-dimensional data on
low-dimensional manifolds. Multiple factors, including stochasticities in the
training process, model architectures, and additional inductive biases, may
induce different representations, even when learning the same task on the same
data. However, it has recently been shown that when a latent structure is
shared between distinct latent spaces, relative distances between
representations can be preserved, up to distortions. Building on this idea, we
demonstrate that exploiting the differential-geometric structure of latent
spaces of neural models, it is possible to capture precisely the
transformations between representational spaces trained on similar data
distributions. Specifically, we assume that distinct neural models parametrize
approximately the same underlying manifold, and introduce a representation
based on the pullback metric that captures the intrinsic structure of the
latent space, while scaling efficiently to large models. We validate
experimentally our method on model stitching and retrieval tasks, covering
autoencoders and vision foundation discriminative models, across diverse
architectures, datasets, and pretraining schemes.

Result: 模型有效减少实时父交易查询需求，显著降低跨分片通信开销，提高吞吐量和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法为UTXO区块链扩展提供了高效解决方案，未来可进一步优化模型性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) approach for scalability of
UTXO-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin. Prior approaches to UTXO set sharding
struggle with distributing UTXOs effectively across validators, creating
substantial communication overhead due to child-parent transaction
dependencies. This overhead, which arises from the need to locate parent UTXOs,
significantly hampers transaction processing speeds. Our solution uses ML to
optimize not only UTXO set sharding but also the routing of incoming
transactions, ensuring that transactions are directed to shards containing
their parent UTXOs. At the heart of our approach is a framework that combines
contrastive and unsupervised learning to create an embedding space for
transaction outputs. This embedding allows the model to group transaction
outputs based on spending relationships, making it possible to route
transactions efficiently to the correct validation microservices. Trained on
historical transaction data with triplet loss and online semi-hard negative
mining, the model embeds parent-child spending patterns directly into its
parameters, thus eliminating the need for costly, real-time parent transaction
lookups. This significantly reduces cross-shard communication overhead,
boosting throughput and scalability.

Motivation: 传统鲁棒优化方法专注于在最坏情况下最大化性能，而本文考虑的是在对抗条件下持续达到预定性能阈值τ的鲁棒满足目标。

Method: 提出了两种基于不同鲁棒满足目标表述的新算法，并证明它们是通用鲁棒满足框架的实例。

Result: 推导出两种遗憾界：一种在对抗条件和阈值τ满足特定假设时随时间次线性增长；另一种与扰动幅度相关且无需对抗假设。实验表明该方法在满足目标上优于传统鲁棒优化方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的鲁棒满足框架在对抗扰动环境下表现优越，特别是在鲁棒优化框架的模糊集不准确时。

Abstract: We address the problem of Gaussian Process (GP) optimization in the presence
of unknown and potentially varying adversarial perturbations. Unlike
traditional robust optimization approaches that focus on maximizing performance
under worst-case scenarios, we consider a robust satisficing objective, where
the goal is to consistently achieve a predefined performance threshold $\tau$,
even under adversarial conditions. We propose two novel algorithms based on
distinct formulations of robust satisficing, and show that they are instances
of a general robust satisficing framework. Further, each algorithm offers
different guarantees depending on the nature of the adversary. Specifically, we
derive two regret bounds: one that is sublinear over time, assuming certain
conditions on the adversary and the satisficing threshold $\tau$, and another
that scales with the perturbation magnitude but requires no assumptions on the
adversary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the established robust optimization methods in achieving the
satisficing objective, particularly when the ambiguity set of the robust
optimization framework is inaccurately specified.

*Zehao Wu,Yanjie Zhao,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensorGuard提出了一种基于梯度的指纹框架，用于检测LLM的相似性和家族分类，解决了模型衍生品追踪的技术空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM成为现代应用的核心组件，未经授权的模型衍生（如微调、合并和再分发）成为软件工程挑战。当前缺乏有效机制追踪模型来源和执行许可协议，尤其是开源模型如LLaMA要求衍生作品保持命名约定但无技术手段验证合规性。

Method: TensorGuard通过分析随机输入扰动下各张量层的梯度响应，提取模型内在行为特征，构建高维指纹。支持safetensors格式，利用梯度特征统计分析实现模型相似性评估和家族分类（基于K-Means聚类及已知基模型初始化）。

Result: 在包含8个基模型和50个衍生品的58个模型测试中，基于初始化的K-Means聚类实现了94%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: TensorGuard为LLM的溯源和合规性验证提供了有效技术手段，填补了模型衍生品追踪的空白。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Bidirectional SAC算法，结合正向和反向KL散度的优势，显著提升SAC在连续控制任务中的性能和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAC算法使用反向KL散度进行策略更新，存在不稳定和样本效率低的问题。本文探索正向KL散度的应用，以解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Bidirectional SAC算法，先用正向KL散度显式初始化策略，再通过反向KL散度优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，Bidirectional SAC在连续控制基准任务中表现优于标准SAC和其他基线方法，奖励提升高达30%。

Conclusion: 结合两种KL散度的Bidirectional SAC算法显著提升了性能和样本效率，为强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a state-of-the-art method in maximum
entropy reinforcement learning, traditionally relies on minimizing reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for policy updates. However, this approach
leads to an intractable optimal projection policy, necessitating gradient-based
approximations that can suffer from instability and poor sample efficiency.
This paper investigates the alternative use of forward KL divergence within
SAC. We demonstrate that for Gaussian policies, forward KL divergence yields an
explicit optimal projection policy -- corresponding to the mean and variance of
the target Boltzmann distribution's action marginals. Building on the distinct
advantages of both KL directions, we propose Bidirectional SAC, an algorithm
that first initializes the policy using the explicit forward KL projection and
then refines it by optimizing the reverse KL divergence. Comprehensive
experiments on continuous control benchmarks show that Bidirectional SAC
significantly outperforms standard SAC and other baselines, achieving up to a
$30\%$ increase in episodic rewards, alongside enhanced sample efficiency.

Motivation: 混合专家模型（MoE）在机器学习领域取得了显著成果，但其理论理解因架构复杂性而滞后。本文旨在通过理论分析填补这一空白，探讨MoE在非线性回归任务中的优势。

Method: 本文采用随机梯度下降（SGD）方法，研究了MoE在学习具有潜在聚类结构的单指标模型回归任务时的样本和运行时复杂度。

Result: 研究发现，普通神经网络无法有效识别潜在聚类结构，而MoE能够将问题分解为更简单的子问题，通过各专家模型分别处理单个聚类的简单函数。

Conclusion: 本文首次通过理论分析揭示了MoE框架在非线性回归任务中的优势，为后续研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE), an ensemble of specialized models equipped with a
router that dynamically distributes each input to appropriate experts, has
achieved successful results in the field of machine learning. However,
theoretical understanding of this architecture is falling behind due to its
inherent complexity. In this paper, we theoretically study the sample and
runtime complexity of MoE following the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) when
learning a regression task with an underlying cluster structure of single index
models. On the one hand, we prove that a vanilla neural network fails in
detecting such a latent organization as it can only process the problem as a
whole. This is intrinsically related to the concept of information exponent
which is low for each cluster, but increases when we consider the entire task.
On the other hand, we show that a MoE succeeds in dividing this problem into
easier subproblems by leveraging the ability of each expert to weakly recover
the simpler function corresponding to an individual cluster. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is among the first to explore the benefits of the MoE
framework by examining its SGD dynamics in the context of nonlinear regression.

Conclusion: 该研究首次为基于解析梯度的强化学习提供了有效的安全保障，填补了该领域的空白，并验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots in safety-critical applications requires safety
guarantees. Provably safe reinforcement learning is an active field of research
which aims to provide such guarantees using safeguards. These safeguards should
be integrated during training to prevent a large sim-to-real gap. While there
are several approaches for safeguarding sampling-based reinforcement learning,
analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning often achieves superior
performance and sample efficiency. However, there is no safeguarding approach
for this learning paradigm yet. Our work addresses this gap by developing the
first effective safeguard for analytic gradient-based reinforcement learning.
We analyse existing, differentiable safeguards, adapt them through modified
mappings and gradient formulations, and integrate them with a state-of-the-art
learning algorithm and a differentiable simulation. We evaluate how different
safeguards affect policy optimisation using numerical experiments on two
classical control tasks. The results demonstrate safeguarded training without
compromising performance.

Result: 提升了控制信号的兼容性，使静默控制信号区域生成更自由和谐。

Conclusion: Minimal Impact ControlNet有效解决了多控制信号冲突问题，优化了图像生成效果。

Abstract: With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for
high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that
utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in
current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of
an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are
expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This
issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions
lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to
as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent
control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas,
resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal
Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key
strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature
signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score
function's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance
the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious
generation in areas with silent control signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专家建议预测问题中，现有自适应算法的遗憾界限通常包含一个低阶项，例如损失的最大值。论文发现，在重尾损失的情况下，这一低阶项可能主导整体遗憾，尤其是在损失的二阶矩较小的情况下。因此，需要开发新的算法来避免这种依赖。

Method: 论文提出了一种改进的自适应算法，该算法不需要任何关于损失范围或二阶矩的先验知识，并且避免了依赖低阶项的遗憾界限。

Result: 新算法在最坏情况下保证了O(√(θTlog(K)))的遗憾界限，在损失从固定分布独立同分布采样时保证了O(θlog(KT)/Δ_min)的遗憾界限。此外，在平方损失函数下，算法还提供了优于先前结果的遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 论文通过改进的自适应算法，有效解决了重尾损失情况下低阶项主导遗憾的问题，并在不同场景下提供了更优的遗憾界限。

Abstract: We consider the problem setting of prediction with expert advice with
possibly heavy-tailed losses, i.e.\ the only assumption on the losses is an
upper bound on their second moments, denoted by $\theta$. We develop adaptive
algorithms that do not require any prior knowledge about the range or the
second moment of the losses. Existing adaptive algorithms have what is
typically considered a lower-order term in their regret guarantees. We show
that this lower-order term, which is often the maximum of the losses, can
actually dominate the regret bound in our setting. Specifically, we show that
even with small constant $\theta$, this lower-order term can scale as
$\sqrt{KT}$, where $K$ is the number of experts and $T$ is the time horizon. We
propose adaptive algorithms with improved regret bounds that avoid the
dependence on such a lower-order term and guarantee $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\theta
T\log(K)})$ regret in the worst case, and $\mathcal{O}(\theta
\log(KT)/\Delta_{\min})$ regret when the losses are sampled i.i.d.\ from some
fixed distribution, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the difference between the mean
losses of the second best expert and the best expert. Additionally, when the
loss function is the squared loss, our algorithm also guarantees improved
regret bounds over prior results.

Abstract: Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world
applications, from training machine learning models to integer-linear
optimization. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or
quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs)
have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving
such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of
strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many
such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in
data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems
such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation
tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data
augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving
instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised
learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for
enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates
effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.

Abstract: The problem of identifying geometric structure in data is a cornerstone of
(unsupervised) learning. As a result, Geometric Representation Learning has
been widely applied across scientific and engineering domains. In this work, we
investigate the use of Geometric Representation Learning for the data-driven
discovery of system dynamics from spatial-temporal data. We propose to encode
similarity structure in such data in a spatial-temporal proximity graph, to
which we apply a range of classical and deep learning-based manifold learning
approaches to learn reduced order dynamics. We observe that while manifold
learning is generally capable of recovering reduced order dynamics, the quality
of the learned representations varies substantially across different algorithms
and hyperparameter choices. This is indicative of high sensitivity to the
inherent geometric assumptions of the respective approaches and suggests a need
for careful hyperparameter tuning, which can be expensive in practise. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a framework for Automated Manifold
Learning, which selects a manifold learning approach and corresponding
hyperparameter choices based on representative subsamples of the input graph.
We demonstrate that the proposed framework leads to performance gains both in
scalability and in the learned representations' accuracy in capturing local and
global geometric features of the underlying system dynamics.

Motivation: 联邦遗忘（FU）虽能合规删除特定数据对全局模型的影响，但恶意服务器可能利用遗忘更新重构被删数据（DRA）。现有针对集中式MLaaS的DRA研究无法直接适用于去中心化的FU场景。

Method: 提出DRAUN攻击框架，针对广泛采用的基于优化的遗忘方法，通过理论分析突破现有DRA在FU中的局限性。

Result: 在4个数据集和4种模型架构上的实验表明，DRAUN能有效重构被遗忘数据，当前最先进的FU方法均存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究证明FU系统仍需增强防御机制以应对DRA风险，为隐私保护型机器学习提供了新的安全挑战视角。

Abstract: Federated Unlearning (FU) enables clients to remove the influence of specific
data from a collaboratively trained shared global model, addressing regulatory
requirements such as GDPR and CCPA. However, this unlearning process introduces
a new privacy risk: A malicious server may exploit unlearning updates to
reconstruct the data requested for removal, a form of Data Reconstruction
Attack (DRA). While DRAs for machine unlearning have been studied extensively
in centralized Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) settings, their
applicability to FU remains unclear due to the decentralized, client-driven
nature of FU. This work presents DRAUN, the first attack framework to
reconstruct unlearned data in FU systems. DRAUN targets optimization-based
unlearning methods, which are widely adopted for their efficiency. We
theoretically demonstrate why existing DRAs targeting machine unlearning in
MLaaS fail in FU and show how DRAUN overcomes these limitations. We validate
our approach through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model
architectures, evaluating its performance against five popular unlearning
methods, effectively demonstrating that state-of-the-art FU methods remain
vulnerable to DRAs.

Conclusion: FedGenGMM适用于边缘计算环境，具有灵活性、高效性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach
for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios.
In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients
collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges
include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy
concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models,
trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single
communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs,
enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a
global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image,
tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves
performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even
under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly
reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly
detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it
particularly suitable for edge computing environments.

Result: 与仅使用用户查询的基线模型相比，MTL-CNLU-SAWC模型的Top 2准确率提高了4.8%，比现有结合查询和上下文的最先进模型提高了3.5%。该模型在沃尔玛客户服务领域部署，显著减少了人工干预需求，每年为公司节省近百万美元。

Conclusion: 通过结合上下文信息和多任务学习，MTL-CNLU-SAWC模型显著提高了意图分类的准确性，优化了客户服务流程，降低了运营成本。

Abstract: Customer service chatbots are conversational systems aimed at addressing
customer queries, often by directing them to automated workflows. A crucial
aspect of this process is the classification of the customer's intent.
Presently, most intent classification models for customer care utilise only
customer query for intent prediction. This may result in low-accuracy models,
which cannot handle ambiguous queries. An ambiguous query like "I didn't
receive my package" could indicate a delayed order, or an order that was
delivered but the customer failed to receive it. Resolution of each of these
scenarios requires the execution of very different sequence of steps. Utilizing
additional information, such as the customer's order delivery status, in the
right manner can help identify the intent for such ambiguous queries. In this
paper, we have introduced a context-aware NLU model that incorporates both, the
customer query and contextual information from the customer's order status for
predicting customer intent. A novel selective attention module is used to
extract relevant context features. We have also proposed a multi-task learning
paradigm for the effective utilization of different label types available in
our training data. Our suggested method, Multi-Task Learning Contextual NLU
with Selective Attention Weighted Context (MTL-CNLU-SAWC), yields a 4.8%
increase in top 2 accuracy score over the baseline model which only uses user
queries, and a 3.5% improvement over existing state-of-the-art models that
combine query and context. We have deployed our model to production for
Walmart's customer care domain. Accurate intent prediction through
MTL-CNLU-SAWC helps to better direct customers to automated workflows, thereby
significantly reducing escalations to human agents, leading to almost a million
dollars in yearly savings for the company.

Motivation: 当前高质量数据集的创建与评估存在挑战，包括缺乏原创性、多样性和严格的质量控制，现有工具和方法不足以提供标准化、可衡量的评估手段。

Method: 提出DataRubrics框架，结合基于LLM的评估方法，提供可重复、可扩展的数据集质量评估方案。

Conclusion: 通过引入DataRubrics框架，论文呼吁在数据为中心的研究中采用更高标准，提升数据集质量评估的透明度和可操作性。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine
learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human
annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions
lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these
shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also
frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties.
While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are
largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for
evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences
promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these
limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic,
rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as
submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective
methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and
LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to
action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the
quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances
in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and
actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and
reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release
code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为IF-Guide的主动方法，通过影响函数识别和抑制训练数据中的有害标记，以减少大型语言模型中的毒性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有减少模型毒性的方法多为反应式，如微调预训练模型以符合人类价值观。本文旨在提出一种主动方法，直接从训练数据中识别和抑制有害内容。

Method: 提出IF-Guide方法，通过改进的影响函数测量训练数据中标记对模型毒性的贡献，并设计了选择有害训练文档的技术和学习目标，适用于预训练和微调。

Result: IF-Guide显著降低了显性和隐性毒性，最高可达未审查模型的10倍和基线对齐方法的3倍，且计算效率高，无需大规模模型计算影响分数。

Conclusion: IF-Guide是一种高效且无需人类偏好数据的主动方法，能有效减少大型语言模型中的毒性行为。

Abstract: We study how training data contributes to the emergence of toxic behaviors in
large-language models. Most prior work on reducing model toxicity adopts
$reactive$ approaches, such as fine-tuning pre-trained (and potentially toxic)
models to align them with human values. In contrast, we propose a $proactive$
approach$-$IF-Guide$-$which leverages influence functions to identify harmful
tokens within any training data and suppress their impact during training. To
this end, we first show that standard influence functions are ineffective at
discovering harmful training records. We then present a novel adaptation that
measures token-level attributions from training data to model toxicity, along
with techniques for selecting toxic training documents and a learning objective
that can be integrated into both pre-training and fine-tuning. Moreover,
IF-Guide does not rely on human-preference data, which is typically required by
existing alignment methods. In evaluation, we demonstrate that IF-Guide
substantially reduces both explicit and implicit toxicity$-$by up to 10$\times$
compared to uncensored models, and up to 3$\times$ compared to baseline
alignment methods, e.g., DPO and RAD$-$across both pre-training and fine-tuning
scenarios. IF-Guide is computationally efficient: a billion-parameter model is
$not$ $necessary$ for computing influence scores; a million-parameter
model$-$with 7.5$\times$ fewer parameters$-$can effectively serve as a proxy
for identifying harmful data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号图能同时编码正负边权重，表示数据中的相关性和反相关性。平衡符号图无含奇数负边的环，其拉普拉斯矩阵的特征向量可通过简单线性变换映射到正图拉普拉斯矩阵的特征向量，从而重用为正图设计的谱滤波工具。

Conclusion: 提出的平衡图学习方法不仅高效，还能重用现有为正图设计的工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Signed graphs are equipped with both positive and negative edge weights,
encoding pairwise correlations as well as anti-correlations in data. A balanced
signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of
negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map
via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph
Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for
positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed
graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear
programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called
CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the
linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so
that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative
edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter
$\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a
minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring
a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution
convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results
on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning
method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters,
wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.

Motivation: 由于机器学习算法的需求增长，但在能源、安全和成本受限的环境中，缺乏加速器使得大模型推理困难，因此研究如何在仅CPU环境下优化推理速度。

Method: 使用Llama.cpp和QWEN模型进行实验，测试不同缓存配置的性能并分析内存访问模式。

Result: 通过实验确定了内存访问模式和性能特征，为优化提供了依据。

Conclusion: 优化缓存架构可以有效提升CPU环境下LLM的推理速度。

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms are shown to be an increasingly valuable tool,
the demand for their access has grown accordingly. Oftentimes, it is infeasible
to run inference with larger models without an accelerator, which may be
unavailable in environments that have constraints such as energy consumption,
security, or cost. To increase the availability of these models, we aim to
improve the LLM inference speed on a CPU-only environment by modifying the
cache architecture. To determine what improvements could be made, we conducted
two experiments using Llama.cpp and the QWEN model: running various cache
configurations and evaluating their performance, and outputting a trace of the
memory footprint. Using these experiments, we investigate the memory access
patterns and performance characteristics to identify potential optimizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督预训练方法在DNA序列建模上效果不佳，因为纯DNA序列缺乏足够的信息，其功能受染色质可及性等基因组特征调控。

Method: 论文提出了SPACE模型，利用混合专家（MoE）技术捕捉不同物种和基因组特征之间的关系，从而学习更有效的DNA表示。

Result: 通过大量实验，SPACE模型在多个任务上取得了最先进的性能，证明了监督学习方法在DNA表示学习中的优势。

Conclusion: 监督学习的基因组特征预测是比纯序列预训练更有效的DNA表示学习方法，SPACE模型为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers
have applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these
approaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack
sufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles
like chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for
genomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure
sequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and
multi-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our
$\textbf{S}$pecies-$\textbf{P}$rofile $\textbf{A}$daptive
$\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of
Experts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across
different species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA
representations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained
with supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型通常庞大且昂贵，忽视了社区收集的数据。SmolVLA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SmolVLA设计为在单个GPU上训练，部署在消费级GPU或CPU上，并引入异步推理堆栈以提高响应速度。

Result: 尽管体积小，SmolVLA在模拟和真实机器人基准测试中表现与10倍大的模型相当。

Conclusion: SmolVLA展示了高效、低成本且性能优异的视觉-语言-动作模型的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pretrained on large-scale multimodal datasets
encode rich visual and linguistic knowledge, making them a strong foundation
for robotics. Rather than training robotic policies from scratch, recent
approaches adapt VLMs into vision-language-action (VLA) models that enable
natural language-driven perception and control. However, existing VLAs are
typically massive--often with billions of parameters--leading to high training
costs and limited real-world deployability. Moreover, they rely on academic and
industrial datasets, overlooking the growing availability of
community-collected data from affordable robotic platforms. In this work, we
present SmolVLA, a small, efficient, and community-driven VLA that drastically
reduces both training and inference costs, while retaining competitive
performance. SmolVLA is designed to be trained on a single GPU and deployed on
consumer-grade GPUs or even CPUs. To further improve responsiveness, we
introduce an asynchronous inference stack decoupling perception and action
prediction from action execution, allowing higher control rates with chunked
action generation. Despite its compact size, SmolVLA achieves performance
comparable to VLAs that are 10x larger. We evaluate SmolVLA on a range of both
simulated as well as real-world robotic benchmarks and release all code,
pretrained models, and training data.

Abstract: This competition hosted on Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first
part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the
"Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European
Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is
based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project
-- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry
forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and
reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry
forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided
with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry
(without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of
poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series
forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter
notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be
published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the
competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate
time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set
of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and
duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular
Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time
series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of
the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other
safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model
poisoning may lead to serious consequences.

TL;DR: 该论文通过建立数据处理不等式与数据记忆化的新联系，提出了证明数据记忆化下限的通用方法，并展示了在简单二元分类问题中样本数量与记忆化信息量之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于大型语言模型训练中存在对训练数据的显著记忆化现象，这可能引发隐私问题，因此需要深入探讨数据记忆化在学习过程中的作用。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于强数据处理不等式与数据记忆化之间新联系的通用方法，用于证明数据记忆化的下限，并扩展到更一般的聚类混合模型。

Result: 研究结果表明，在少量样本情况下，算法需要记忆Ω(d)比特的训练数据信息，且这一需求随样本数量增加以问题特定速率递减。简单学习算法在大多数情况下能匹配这些下限（对数因子内）。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅扩展了Brown等人(2021)的研究，解决了其下限的若干局限性，还为理解数据记忆化与学习效率之间的基本权衡提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrated that training large language models involves
memorization of a significant fraction of training data. Such memorization can
lead to privacy violations when training on sensitive user data and thus
motivates the study of data memorization's role in learning. In this work, we
develop a general approach for proving lower bounds on excess data
memorization, that relies on a new connection between strong data processing
inequalities and data memorization. We then demonstrate that several simple and
natural binary classification problems exhibit a trade-off between the number
of samples available to a learning algorithm, and the amount of information
about the training data that a learning algorithm needs to memorize to be
accurate. In particular, $\Omega(d)$ bits of information about the training
data need to be memorized when $O(1)$ $d$-dimensional examples are available,
which then decays as the number of examples grows at a problem-specific rate.
Further, our lower bounds are generally matched (up to logarithmic factors) by
simple learning algorithms. We also extend our lower bounds to more general
mixture-of-clusters models. Our definitions and results build on the work of
Brown et al. (2021) and address several limitations of the lower bounds in
their work.

Motivation: 随着AI计算成本的上升，模型压缩技术（如量化和稀疏化）成为减少大规模训练和推理计算需求的关键。然而，这些压缩技术如何与缩放定律相互作用尚不明确。本文旨在探索是否可以通过一个统一的缩放框架来预测在不同压缩表示下训练的模型性能。

Method: 论文通过验证一个通用的缩放定律公式，并证明其在多种压缩类型（如稀疏、标量量化、稀疏量化和向量量化）下的适用性。此外，论文引入了一个基于表示能力的“容量”度量标准，用于预测参数效率。

Result: 研究结果表明，该统一的缩放框架能够准确预测不同压缩表示下的模型性能。理论和实证分析均表明，“容量”度量标准能够稳健地预测多种压缩表示下的参数效率。此外，论文还提出了直接比较不同压缩格式精度潜力的方法，并改进了稀疏量化格式的训练算法。

Conclusion: 论文成功建立了一个统一的缩放框架，能够适用于多种压缩表示，并发现“容量”度量标准是预测参数效率的有效工具。这一成果为模型压缩技术的进一步优化提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling
predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and
data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated
model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which
have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with
large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay
between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified
scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs
over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized,
sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions
include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is
applicable both individually but also composably across compression types.
Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and
empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the
representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly
predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the
practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy
potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for
training over sparse-quantized formats.

Abstract: As a machine-learned potential, the neuroevolution potential (NEP) method
features exceptional computational efficiency and has been successfully applied
in materials science. Constructing high-quality training datasets is crucial
for developing accurate NEP models. However, the preparation and screening of
NEP training datasets remain a bottleneck for broader applications due to their
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive nature. In this work,
we have developed NepTrain and NepTrainKit, which are dedicated to initializing
and managing training datasets to generate high-quality training sets while
automating NEP model training. NepTrain is an open-source Python package that
features a bond length filtering method to effectively identify and remove
non-physical structures from molecular dynamics trajectories, thereby ensuring
high-quality training datasets. NepTrainKit is a graphical user interface (GUI)
software designed specifically for NEP training datasets, providing
functionalities for data editing, visualization, and interactive exploration.
It integrates key features such as outlier identification, farthest-point
sampling, non-physical structure detection, and configuration type selection.
The combination of these tools enables users to process datasets more
efficiently and conveniently. Using $\rm CsPbI_3$ as a case study, we
demonstrate the complete workflow for training NEP models with NepTrain and
further validate the models through materials property predictions. We believe
this toolkit will greatly benefit researchers working with machine learning
interatomic potentials.

resource constraints. This field aims to achieve acceptable performance while
minimizing the use of computational resources, time, energy, and data for both

frugality, learning process frugality, and model frugality, each focusing on
reducing resource consumption at different stages of the ML pipeline. This
chapter explores recent advancements, applications, and open challenges in FML,
emphasizing its importance for smart environments that incorporate edge
computing and IoT devices, which often face strict limitations in bandwidth,
energy, or latency. Technological enablers such as model compression,
energy-efficient hardware, and data-efficient learning techniques are
discussed, along with adaptive methods including parameter regularization,
knowledge distillation, and dynamic architecture design that enable incremental
model updates without full retraining. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive
taxonomy of frugal methods, discusses case studies across diverse domains, and
identifies future research directions to drive innovation in this evolving
field.

Abstract: In this work, we study the active sequential hypothesis testing problem, also
known as pure exploration, where the goal is to actively control a data
collection process to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis underlying a
decision problem. While relevant across multiple domains, devising adaptive
exploration strategies remains challenging, particularly due to difficulties in
encoding appropriate inductive biases. Existing Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based methods often underperform when relevant information structures are
inadequately represented, whereas more complex methods, like Best Arm
Identification (BAI) techniques, may be difficult to devise and typically rely
on explicit modeling assumptions. To address these limitations, we introduce
In-Context Pure Exploration (ICPE), an in-context learning approach that uses
Transformers to learn exploration strategies directly from experience. ICPE
combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to identify and exploit
latent structure across related tasks, without requiring prior assumptions.
Numerical results across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks
highlight ICPE's capability to achieve robust performance performance in
deterministic, stochastic, and structured settings. These results demonstrate
ICPE's ability to match optimal instance-dependent algorithms using only deep
learning techniques, making it a practical and general approach to
data-efficient exploration.

*Davide D'Ascenzo,Sebastiano Cultrera di Montesano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: scDataset是一个直接在AnnData文件上操作的PyTorch IterableDataset，通过块采样和批量获取平衡随机性和I/O效率，显著提升了大规模单细胞数据集的训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代单细胞数据集包含数亿个细胞，现有的数据加载解决方案要么需要将所有数据加载到内存中，要么转换为密集格式增加存储需求，且许多方案因随机磁盘访问速度慢而受限。

Method: scDataset结合了块采样和批量获取，直接在AnnData文件上操作，无需格式转换，从而平衡了随机性和I/O效率。

Result: 在Tahoe 100M数据集上，scDataset在单核设置下比AnnLoader快48倍，比HuggingFace Datasets快27倍，比BioNeMo快18倍。

Conclusion: scDataset的进步为更广泛的研究社区提供了大规模单细胞模型训练的民主化工具。

Abstract: Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells,
presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that
require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is
the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading
solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into
memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many
are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch
IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the
need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block
sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O
efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$
speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and
an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances
democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research
community.

TL;DR: 该论文从学习理论角度系统研究了强化学习在函数逼近下的统计复杂度，提出了无假设策略学习框架，并揭示了其统计性能边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在许多领域取得了显著成功，但针对大规模状态空间下函数逼近的统计复杂度仍缺乏理论理解。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用无假设策略学习框架，从环境访问方式、覆盖条件和表示条件三个维度系统分析，设计新算法并建立理论保证。

Result: 发现了显著的统计分离现象，揭示了无假设策略学习的能力边界，并提出了具有理论保证的新算法。

Conclusion: 研究为函数逼近下的强化学习建立了系统的统计复杂度理论框架，为后续研究提供了理论基础和方法指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated tremendous empirical success
across numerous challenging domains. However, we lack a strong theoretical
understanding of the statistical complexity of RL in environments with large
state spaces, where function approximation is required for sample-efficient
learning. This thesis addresses this gap by rigorously examining the
statistical complexity of RL with function approximation from a learning
theoretic perspective. Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider
the weakest form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, in
which the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\Pi$, with no
guarantee that $\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task.
  We systematically explore agnostic policy learning along three key axes:
environment access -- how a learner collects data from the environment;
coverage conditions -- intrinsic properties of the underlying MDP measuring the
expansiveness of state-occupancy measures for policies in the class $\Pi$, and
representational conditions -- structural assumptions on the class $\Pi$
itself. Within this comprehensive framework, we (1) design new learning
algorithms with theoretical guarantees and (2) characterize fundamental
performance bounds of any algorithm. Our results reveal significant statistical
separations that highlight the power and limitations of agnostic policy
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测阿尔茨海默病对临床干预至关重要。现有方法模态融合粗糙，需更精准的跨模态交互策略。

Method: 采用词级时间对齐策略同步音频与文本特征，提出门控交叉注意力融合机制，并加入停顿词嵌入以增强韵律特征。

Result: 在ADReSSo数据集上准确率达90.36%，消融实验验证了对齐策略、注意力融合和韵律建模的有效性。

Conclusion: CogniAlign通过细粒度多模态融合显著提升检测性能，为认知障碍早期诊断提供新思路。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is
critical for enabling timely clinical intervention and improving patient
outcomes. In this work, we introduce CogniAlign, a multimodal architecture for
Alzheimer's detection that integrates audio and textual modalities, two
non-intrusive sources of information that offer complementary insights into
cognitive health. Unlike prior approaches that fuse modalities at a coarse
level, CogniAlign leverages a word-level temporal alignment strategy that
synchronizes audio embeddings with corresponding textual tokens based on
transcription timestamps. This alignment supports the development of
token-level fusion techniques, enabling more precise cross-modal interactions.
To fully exploit this alignment, we propose a Gated Cross-Attention Fusion
mechanism, where audio features attend over textual representations, guided by
the superior unimodal performance of the text modality. In addition, we
incorporate prosodic cues, specifically interword pauses, by inserting pause
tokens into the text and generating audio embeddings for silent intervals,
further enriching both streams. We evaluate CogniAlign on the ADReSSo dataset,
where it achieves an accuracy of 90.36%, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods. A detailed ablation study confirms the advantages of
our alignment strategy, attention-based fusion, and prosodic modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MLorc的内存高效训练方法，通过压缩和重构动量而非梯度，优于现有低秩方法，性能接近全参数微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模的增加，全参数微调需要大量内存。现有低秩方法如LoRA和GaLore在训练动态上存在局限，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: MLorc直接压缩和重构动量，避免对权重更新矩阵施加固定秩约束，从而更好地保留全参数微调的训练动态。

Result: MLorc在内存效率和时间效率上均优于其他方法，性能接近甚至超过全参数微调，且适用于不同优化器。

Conclusion: MLorc是一种高效且性能优越的训练方法，理论上有收敛保证，适用于大规模语言模型微调。

Abstract: With increasing size of large language models (LLMs), full-parameter
fine-tuning imposes substantial memory demands. To alleviate this, we propose a
novel memory-efficient training paradigm called Momentum Low-rank compression
(MLorc). By directly compressing and reconstructing momentum rather than
gradients, MLorc avoids imposing a fixed-rank constraint on weight update
matrices and better preserves the training dynamics of full-parameter
fine-tuning, in contrast to existing low-rank approaches such as LoRA and
GaLore. Empirically, MLorc consistently outperforms other memory-efficient
training methods, matches or even exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning
with a small rank (e.g., $r=4$), and generalizes well across different
optimizers -- all while not compromising time or memory efficiency.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for its convergence under
reasonable assumptions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合SMOTE和差分隐私的合成数据生成方法SMOTE-DP，能在保护隐私的同时保持数据实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护数据发布方法（如合成数据）在隐私与实用性之间存在权衡。传统方法如差分隐私会引入噪声导致实用性下降，而合成数据可能泄露异常值信息。

Method: 提出SMOTE-DP技术，将生成收缩数据模式的合成方法（如SMOTE）与差分隐私生成器结合，利用两者优势。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，SMOTE-DP生成的合成数据既能提供强隐私保护，又能在下游学习任务中保持实用性。

Conclusion: 通过合理机制生成合成数据，可在不显著损失实用性的前提下实现强隐私保护，SMOTE-DP是一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: Privacy-preserving data publication, including synthetic data sharing, often
experiences trade-offs between privacy and utility. Synthetic data is generally
more effective than data anonymization in balancing this trade-off, however,
not without its own challenges. Synthetic data produced by generative models
trained on source data may inadvertently reveal information about outliers.
Techniques specifically designed for preserving privacy, such as introducing
noise to satisfy differential privacy, often incur unpredictable and
significant losses in utility. In this work we show that, with the right
mechanism of synthetic data generation, we can achieve strong privacy
protection without significant utility loss. Synthetic data generators
producing contracting data patterns, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE), can enhance a differentially private data generator,
leveraging the strengths of both. We prove in theory and through empirical
demonstration that this SMOTE-DP technique can produce synthetic data that not
only ensures robust privacy protection but maintains utility in downstream
learning tasks.

Method: 采用混合非欧几里得优化方法，结合梯度范数裁剪和条件梯度，并引入权重衰减和动量梯度估计器。

Result: 在随机情况下实现了最优的O(n^{-1/4})收敛率，并在图像分类和语言建模中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实验中均表现出色，为深度学习优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which
generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and
conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by
establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of
($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner
by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic
case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a
momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms
for deep learning and demonstrate their properties on image classification and

Method: 研究基于典型的序列模型（如隐马尔可夫模型），观察Transformer各层的行为，分析其特征提取和时间解耦能力。

Result: 发现Transformer的低层主要提取邻近令牌的特征表示，而上层特征则表现出高度的时间解耦。理论分析与实证观察一致，支持了Transformer在序列学习中的高效性。

Conclusion: 本文通过实证和理论分析，揭示了Transformer在多任务序列学习中的有效性机制，为其广泛应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Transformer based models have shown remarkable capabilities in sequence
learning across a wide range of tasks, often performing well on specific task
by leveraging input-output examples. Despite their empirical success, a
comprehensive theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In
this work, we investigate the layerwise behavior of Transformers to uncover the
mechanisms underlying their multi-task generalization ability. Taking
explorations on a typical sequence model, i.e, Hidden Markov Models, which are
fundamental to many language tasks, we observe that: first, lower layers of
Transformers focus on extracting feature representations, primarily influenced
by neighboring tokens; second, on the upper layers, features become decoupled,
exhibiting a high degree of time disentanglement. Building on these empirical
insights, we provide theoretical analysis for the expressiveness power of
Transformers. Our explicit constructions align closely with empirical
observations, providing theoretical support for the Transformer's effectiveness
and efficiency on sequence learning across diverse tasks.

Method: 使用74,916个心脏磁共振研究训练自监督自动编码器模型，通过掩码输入重建图像，并进行微调。

Result: CineMA在8个数据集上23项任务中表现优异，优于传统CNN模型，且标注效率更高。

Conclusion: CineMA减少了临床标注负担，为心脏影像分析提供了高效解决方案，并开源促进可重复性和临床转化。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical
cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research.
However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction
for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective.
We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited
labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine
CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was
evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and
myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction
calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation.
CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label
efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer
annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports
replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future
cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning
are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access
to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种灵活混合精度量化方法（FMPQ），通过为神经网络不同层分配不同位宽，优化了学习图像压缩（LIC）模型的量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习图像压缩（LIC）虽然性能优于传统编解码器，但其计算和存储成本较高。固定精度量化方法未能充分利用资源，因为神经网络不同层对量化的敏感性不同。

Method: 提出FMPQ方法，根据率失真损失的分数变化为不同层分配不同位宽，并引入自适应搜索算法降低量化位宽分布搜索的时间复杂度。

Result: 在相似模型大小约束下，FMPQ方法在BD-Rate性能上优于其他LIC模型量化方法。

Conclusion: FMPQ方法有效降低了LIC模型的计算复杂度，同时保持了高性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Despite its improvements in coding performance compared to traditional
codecs, Learned Image Compression (LIC) suffers from large computational costs
for storage and deployment. Model quantization offers an effective solution to
reduce the computational complexity of LIC models. However, most existing works
perform fixed-precision quantization which suffers from sub-optimal utilization
of resources due to the varying sensitivity to quantization of different layers
of a neural network. In this paper, we propose a Flexible Mixed Precision
Quantization (FMPQ) method that assigns different bit-widths to different
layers of the quantized network using the fractional change in rate-distortion
loss as the bit-assignment criterion. We also introduce an adaptive search
algorithm which reduces the time-complexity of searching for the desired
distribution of quantization bit-widths given a fixed model size. Evaluation of
our method shows improved BD-Rate performance under similar model size
constraints compared to other works on quantization of LIC models. We have made
the source code available at gitlab.com/viper-purdue/fmpq.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估量子机器学习在实际图像分类任务中的应用潜力，探讨量子神经网络和混合模型与传统方法相比的性能差异，为量子电路设计、纠缠利用及模型跨应用迁移性提供研究基础。

Method: 采用两种方法：在降维数据上使用随机NNs，以及在全图像数据上应用CNNs。评估了三种复杂度递增的数据集（人工超立方体数据集、MNIST手写数字和真实工业图像），并分析了量子模型超参数与分类准确率的相关性。

Result: 经典与量子/混合模型在大多数数据集上分类准确率统计等价，量子模型训练参数方差更低。可训练参数数量与模型性能正相关，94%表现最佳的量子NNs包含纠缠门，但混合CNNs中无纠缠模型收敛较慢。量子模型跨数据集迁移性有限。

Conclusion: 研究从工业角度展示了量子机器学习在图像分类中的现状，指出现有局限并提出了量子电路设计、纠缠利用及跨应用模型迁移性等未来研究方向。

Abstract: In this study, we compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum
neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of binary image
classification. We use two distinct methodologies: using randomized NNs on
dimensionality-reduced data, and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate
these approaches on three data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial
hypercube dataset, MNIST handwritten digits and real-world industrial images.
We analyze correlations between classification accuracy and quantum model
hyperparameters, including the number of trainable parameters, feature encoding
methods, circuit layers, entangling gate type and structure, gate entangling
power, and measurement operators. For random quantum NNs, we compare their
performance against literature models. Classical and quantum/hybrid models
achieved statistically equivalent classification accuracies across most
datasets, with no approach demonstrating consistent superiority. We observe
that quantum models show lower variance with respect to initial training
parameters, suggesting better training stability. Among the hyperparameters
analyzed, only the number of trainable parameters showed a positive correlation
with the model performance. Around 94% of the best-performing quantum NNs had
entangling gates, although for hybrid CNNs, models without entanglement
performed equally well but took longer to converge. Cross-dataset performance
analysis revealed limited transferability of quantum models between different
classification tasks. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum
machine learning for practical image classification tasks, highlighting both
current limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum
circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across
varied applications.

Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in
scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low
compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter
optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to
quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling
prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative,
though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce
a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a
circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target
unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete
gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over
different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit
counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by
exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits
for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can
help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.

Abstract: The characterization of Hamiltonians and other components of open quantum
dynamical systems plays a crucial role in quantum computing and other
applications. Scientific machine learning techniques have been applied to this
problem in a variety of ways, including by modeling with deep neural networks.
However, the majority of mathematical models describing open quantum systems
are linear, and the natural nonlinearities in learnable models have not been
incorporated using physical principles. We present a data-driven model for open
quantum systems that includes learnable, thermodynamically consistent terms.
The trained model is interpretable, as it directly estimates the system
Hamiltonian and linear components of coupling to the environment. We validate
the model on synthetic two and three-level data, as well as experimental
two-level data collected from a quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.

Conclusion: 结论是SineKAN作为一种新型的神经网络量子态（NQS）方法，在量子多体系统的研究中具有显著优势，能够更准确地捕捉量子态的特性。

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions
parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In
this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold

various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model,
Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which
each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been
investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence
(Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver
that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable
to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel
symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the
transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed
NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the
numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate.
Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline
architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further
show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the
performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.

*TaeJun Ha,Chaehyun Jung,Hyeonuk Kim,Jeongwoo Park,Jeonghun Park*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力机制的A-MMSE方法，通过Transformer学习最优MMSE滤波器，降低了计算复杂度并提高了信道估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MMSE信道估计方法需要难以获取的二阶统计信息，而现有的深度学习方法复杂度较高。因此，需要一种既能高效学习信道相关性，又能降低计算复杂度的方法。

Method: 提出A-MMSE框架，利用注意力Transformer学习最优MMSE滤波器，采用两阶段注意力编码器捕捉信道相关性，并引入秩自适应扩展以平衡复杂度与精度。

Result: 在3GPP TDL信道模型下的仿真表明，A-MMSE在多种信噪比条件下均优于基线方法，且在性能与复杂度之间实现了新的平衡。

Conclusion: A-MMSE及其秩自适应扩展为实际信道估计方法设立了新的性能-复杂度权衡标准。

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel
estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order
statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural
networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often
suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE
(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter
via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel
through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear
activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To
enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention
encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.
Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible
trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive
simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE
consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE
across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its
rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity
trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.

*Mahmoud Elgenedy*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过二次幂量化（PoT）降低大型语言模型复杂度的方法，在边缘设备上实现内存和计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络参数量的激增（如GPT2到GPT3参数从15亿增至1750亿），边缘设备因内存和算力有限面临巨大部署挑战。

Method: 采用二次幂量化技术对线性层权重和Transformer表进行压缩，将乘法运算转换为位运算以降低计算开销。

Result: 在Nano-GPT和124M参数GPT-2模型上的实验显示，4-6位PoT量化仅导致交叉熵损失增加约1.3-0.88。

Conclusion: 二次幂量化能有效平衡模型压缩与性能损失，为边缘设备部署大型语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive
increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs),
the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years,
for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This
raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices
where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we
investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of
two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only
provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant
computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We
obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation
using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The
PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss
degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent
power levels.

Abstract: Low Altitude Economy (LAE) networks own transformative potential in urban
mobility, emergency response, and aerial logistics. However, these networks
face significant challenges in spectrum management, interference mitigation,
and real-time coordination across dynamic and resource-constrained
environments. After addressing these challenges, this study explores three core
elements for enabling intelligent LAE networks as follows machine
learning-based spectrum sensing and coexistence, artificial intelligence
(AI)-optimized resource allocation and trajectory planning, and testbed-driven
validation and standardization. We highlight how federated and reinforcement
learning techniques support decentralized, adaptive decision-making under
mobility and energy constraints. In addition, we discuss the role of real-world
platforms such as AERPAW in bridging the gap between simulation and deployment
and enabling iterative system refinement under realistic conditions. This study
aims to provide a forward-looking roadmap toward developing efficient and
interoperable AI-driven LAE ecosystems.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出Pro3D-Editor框架，通过渐进式视图范式实现3D编辑的一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法忽视视图间依赖关系，导致多视图编辑不一致。

Method: 采用渐进式视图范式，包括主视图采样、关键视图渲染和全视图细化三个模块。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在编辑准确性和空间一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Pro3D-Editor通过渐进式视图传播编辑语义，实现了理想的3D编辑效果。

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D
regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications
ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a
view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting
them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view
interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study,
we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a
\textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from
the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we
propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes
Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view
Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the
primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the
primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank
Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based
on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.

Motivation: 现有神经方法在渲染的蒙特卡洛积分中，分布表示要么速度快但表达力不足，要么表达力强但速度慢。本文旨在提出一种既高效又具表达力的解决方案。

Method: 将2D方向域分布分解为两个1D概率分布函数，每个1D PDF通过神经网络在离散坐标上建模，支持插值评估与采样。训练时最大化学习分布与目标分布的相似性，并通过缓存入射辐射度降低梯度方差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂光传输场景中优于现有方法，实现了表达力与速度的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的神经路径引导方法在渲染中有效提升了蒙特卡洛积分的效率与质量，尤其适用于复杂光照场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte
Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize
distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both.
We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently
expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution
over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions
(PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates
the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary
location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the
network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To
reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the
normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an
additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging
scenes with complex light transport.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在处理包含概念组合矛盾的提示时，常因训练中学习的先验知识而产生语义不准确的结果。这种上下文矛盾现象阻碍了模型生成符合预期的图像。

Method: 采用阶段感知的提示分解框架，利用大语言模型分析目标提示、识别矛盾，并生成保持原意但解决上下文冲突的替代表达。通过一系列代理提示引导去噪过程，确保语义内容与去噪阶段匹配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在各种具有挑战性的提示下显著提高了生成图像与文本提示的对齐程度。

Conclusion: 通过将提示信息与去噪过程对齐，该方法实现了细粒度的语义控制，有效解决了上下文矛盾问题，提升了图像生成的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse
images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce
semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations
that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual
contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled
associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware
prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a
sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the
semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while
ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a
large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify
contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original
intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information
with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic
control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual
contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show
substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量人工从数据库模式生成本体，或仅能生成基础本体，限制了知识图谱的语义互操作性和高级应用。

Method: 结合数据库模式、文档、领域本体库和核心本体，通过RAG增强的LLM迭代生成带溯源的增量本体片段，经评审LLM优化后合并。

Result: 生成的本体在准确性、完整性等质量维度上表现优异，同时大幅降低人工参与。

Conclusion: RIGOR为关系数据库到知识图谱的自动化转换提供了高效解决方案，推动了语义Web技术的发展。

Abstract: Transforming relational databases into knowledge graphs with enriched
ontologies enhances semantic interoperability and unlocks advanced graph-based
learning and reasoning over data. However, previous approaches either demand
significant manual effort to derive an ontology from a database schema or
produce only a basic ontology. We present RIGOR, Retrieval-augmented Iterative
Generation of RDB Ontologies, an LLM-driven approach that turns relational
schemas into rich OWL ontologies with minimal human effort. RIGOR combines
three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository
of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM
for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each
fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology,
and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until
coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs
ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy,
completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while
substantially reducing manual effort.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了SIFBench，一个用于支持基于机器学习的应力强度因子预测的开源大规模基准数据库，旨在解决现有数据集不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疲劳裂纹增长是航空航天、土木工程、汽车和能源等关键行业结构失效的主要原因。准确预测应力强度因子（SIFs）对评估疲劳寿命和确保结构完整性至关重要。然而，机器学习在SIF预测中的应用因缺乏丰富、透明、组织良好且高质量的数据集而受到严重限制。

Method: 为了解决这一问题，作者开发了SIFBench，一个包含超过500万种不同裂纹和组件几何形状的开源数据库，这些数据来源于37种不同场景的高保真有限元模拟。SIFBench提供了统一的Python接口，便于数据访问和定制，并报告了多种流行机器学习模型的基线结果。

Result: SIFBench通过提供标准化和可扩展的资源，显著降低了机器学习方法在损伤容限设计和预测性维护中的应用门槛，并促进了相关方法的发展和应用。

Conclusion: SIFBench作为一个开源、大规模的基准数据库，为基于机器学习的应力强度因子预测提供了重要支持，有望推动该领域的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Fatigue-induced crack growth is a leading cause of structural failure across
critical industries such as aerospace, civil engineering, automotive, and
energy. Accurate prediction of stress intensity factors (SIFs) -- the key
parameters governing crack propagation in linear elastic fracture mechanics --
is essential for assessing fatigue life and ensuring structural integrity.
While machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in SIF prediction, its
advancement has been severely limited by the lack of rich, transparent,
well-organized, and high-quality datasets.
  To address this gap, we introduce SIFBench, an open-source, large-scale
benchmark database designed to support ML-based SIF prediction. SIFBench
contains over 5 million different crack and component geometries derived from
high-fidelity finite element simulations across 37 distinct scenarios, and
provides a unified Python interface for seamless data access and customization.
We report baseline results using a range of popular ML models -- including
random forests, support vector machines, feedforward neural networks, and
Fourier neural operators -- alongside comprehensive evaluation metrics and
template code for model training, validation, and assessment. By offering a
standardized and scalable resource, SIFBench substantially lowers the entry
barrier and fosters the development and application of ML methods in damage
tolerance design and predictive maintenance.

Abstract: Coordinated human movement depends on the integration of multisensory inputs,
sensorimotor transformation, and motor execution, as well as sensory feedback
resulting from body-environment interaction. Building dynamic models of the
sensory-musculoskeletal system is essential for understanding movement control
and investigating human behaviours. Here, we report a human
sensory-musculoskeletal model, termed SMS-Human, that integrates precise
anatomical representations of bones, joints, and muscle-tendon units with
multimodal sensory inputs involving visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and
tactile components. A stage-wise hierarchical deep reinforcement learning
framework was developed to address the inherent challenges of high-dimensional
control in musculoskeletal systems with integrated multisensory information.
Using this framework, we demonstrated the simulation of three representative
movement tasks, including bipedal locomotion, vision-guided object
manipulation, and human-machine interaction during bicycling. Our results
showed a close resemblance between natural and simulated human motor
behaviours. The simulation also revealed musculoskeletal dynamics that could
not be directly measured. This work sheds deeper insights into the sensorimotor
dynamics of human movements, facilitates quantitative understanding of human
behaviours in interactive contexts, and informs the design of systems with
embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and
intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward
or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in
sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as
intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail
to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems
neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing
instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external
reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent
behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic
drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in
animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking
divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We
demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture
the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial
dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the
first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our
findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic
motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building
artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in
lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic
assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high
cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations
and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate
precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning
can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology
slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly
to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled
PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation
sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central
South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links
whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and
tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology
images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early
genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets,
we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in
PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We
benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation,
subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide
valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and
assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted
treatment plans for patients. Code and data are available at

Method: 开发了TrUE-Net模型，结合了保留SNP序列结构的Transformer和随机森林，使用蒙特卡洛Dropout进行不确定性估计，并将样本分为高不确定性和低不确定性组。

Result: 在1050个个体中测试，排除高不确定性组后，准确率从0.6263提升至0.7287（提升10.24%），F1分数从0.5843提升至0.8205（提升23.62%）。

Conclusion: 蒙特卡洛Dropout驱动的不确定性估计有助于识别需要进一步临床评估的模糊病例，从而提高了AD基因组分类的可靠性。

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is genetically complex, complicating
robust classification from genomic data. METHODS: We developed a
transformer-based ensemble model (TrUE-Net) using Monte Carlo Dropout for
uncertainty estimation in AD classification from whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
We combined a transformer that preserves single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
sequence structure with a concurrent random forest using flattened genotypes.
An uncertainty threshold separated samples into an uncertain (high-variance)
group and a more certain (low-variance) group. RESULTS: We analyzed 1050
individuals, holding out half for testing. Overall accuracy and area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.6514 and 0.6636,
respectively. Excluding the uncertain group improved accuracy from 0.6263 to
0.7287 (10.24% increase) and F1 from 0.5843 to 0.8205 (23.62% increase).
DISCUSSION: Monte Carlo Dropout-driven uncertainty helps identify ambiguous
cases that may require further clinical evaluation, thus improving reliability
in AD genomic classification.

Method: GenDMR提出了一种新的单核苷酸多态性（SNPs）空间组织编码方法，增强了其基因组背景的表示；采用多实例注意力模块自适应量化SNPs和脑区的疾病风险；引入主导模态选择模块和对比自蒸馏模块，实现基于主导和辅助模态的动态师生角色交换机制。

Result: GenDMR在ADNI公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，可视化了对不同SNPs的关注，确认了12个与AD相关的潜在高风险基因，包括经典的APOE和近期强调的重要风险基因。

Conclusion: GenDMR在探索AD遗传特征方面具有可解释的分析能力，为多模态数据融合技术的发展提供了新的见解和视角。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that integrating multimodal data fusion techniques
for imaging and genetic features is beneficial for the etiological analysis and
predictive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there are several
critical flaws in current deep learning methods. Firstly, there has been
insufficient discussion and exploration regarding the selection and encoding of
genetic information. Secondly, due to the significantly superior classification
value of AD imaging features compared to genetic features, many studies in
multimodal fusion emphasize the strengths of imaging features, actively
mitigating the influence of weaker features, thereby diminishing the learning
of the unique value of genetic features. To address this issue, this study
proposes the dynamic multimodal role-swapping network (GenDMR). In GenDMR, we
develop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic
context. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and
brain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model
interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection
module and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a
dynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary
modalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally,
GenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and
visualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential
high-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently
highlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable
analytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights
and perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.

Method: 通过分析数据集的倍增维度(λ_X)，证明目标维度O(λ_X)可以近似保留最优解，并与传统降维方法进行对比。

Result: 实验验证了降维后解的质量和速度提升，同时证明某些问题必须依赖倍增维度而非数据集大小。

Conclusion: 随机降维在最大化问题中的效果取决于数据集的倍增维度，目标维度O(λ_X)既能保持解的质量又显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Randomized dimensionality reduction is a widely-used algorithmic technique
for speeding up large-scale Euclidean optimization problems. In this paper, we
study dimension reduction for a variety of maximization problems, including
max-matching, max-spanning tree, max TSP, as well as various measures for
dataset diversity. For these problems, we show that the effect of dimension
reduction is intimately tied to the \emph{doubling dimension} $\lambda_X$ of
the underlying dataset $X$ -- a quantity measuring intrinsic dimensionality of
point sets. Specifically, we prove that a target dimension of $O(\lambda_X)$
suffices to approximately preserve the value of any near-optimal solution,which
we also show is necessary for some of these problems. This is in contrast to
classical dimension reduction results, whose dependence increases with the
dataset size $|X|$. We also provide empirical results validating the quality of
solutions found in the projected space, as well as speedups due to
dimensionality reduction.

Abstract: The Fourier representation for the uniform distribution over the Boolean cube
has found numerous applications in algorithms and complexity analysis. Notably,
in learning theory, learnability of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) under uniform
as well as product distributions has been established through such
representations. This paper makes five main contributions. First, it introduces
a generalized Fourier expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$
through the representation of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN).
Second, it shows that the main algorithmic tools for learning with the Fourier
representation, that use membership queries to approximate functions by
recovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used with slight
modifications with the generalized expansion. These results hold for any
distribution. Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under
the new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions
which can be represented by difference bounded tree BN, where a parent node in
the BN representation can change the conditional expectation of a child node by
at most $\alpha<0.5$. Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints
are necessary. The fourth contribution uses these results to show the
learnability of DNF with membership queries under difference bounded tree BN.
The final contribution is to develop an algorithm for learning
difference-bounded tree BN distributions, thus extending the DNF learnability
result to cases where the distribution is not known in advance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在差分隐私约束下的高效假设选择算法，解决了Bun等人提出的开放性问题，实现了近似因子最优且样本复杂度仅适度增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设选择是统计学中的基础问题，旨在从候选分布中找出最能描述数据真实分布的假设。现有方法在非隐私设置下已很高效，但在差分隐私约束下的算法仍存在时间复杂度过高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种中心模型下的差分隐私算法，运行时间接近线性（相对于假设数量），并保持最优近似因子（α=3）。

Conclusion: 该工作为差分隐私下的假设选择提供了首个高效解决方案，填补了理论空白，且实际计算开销显著降低。

Abstract: Estimating the density of a distribution from its samples is a fundamental
problem in statistics. Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in
addition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred
to as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the
underlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very
efficiently, requiring roughly $O(\log n)$ samples and running in
$\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total
variation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of
the algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal
distance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis. It is known that $\alpha =
3$ is the optimal approximation factor for this problem. We study hypothesis
selection under the constraint of differential privacy. We propose a
differentially private algorithm in the central model that runs in
nearly-linear time with respect to the number of hypotheses, achieves the
optimal approximation factor, and incurs only a modest increase in sample
complexity, which remains polylogarithmic in $n$. This resolves an open
question posed by [Bun, Kamath, Steinke, Wu, NeurIPS 2019]. Prior to our work,
existing upper bounds required quadratic time.

TL;DR: 论文探讨使用LLMs（如MS Copilot）部分自动化软件架构评估，初步研究表明LLM在多数情况下能提供更优的质量场景分析结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构评估方法依赖人工，效率低下且耗时。研究旨在通过LLMs减少人工干预，提高评估效率和决策质量。

Method: 使用MS Copilot分析学生在软件架构课程中提出的质量场景，并将其评估结果与学生的手动分析进行对比。

Result: 初步研究表明，LLM在风险、敏感点和权衡分析方面通常能提供更准确的结果。

Conclusion: 生成式AI有潜力部分自动化架构评估任务，辅助人类决策过程。

Abstract: Architecture evaluation methods have long been used to evaluate software
designs. Several evaluation methods have been proposed and used to analyze
tradeoffs between different quality attributes. Having competing qualities
leads to conflicts for selecting which quality-attribute scenarios are the most
suitable ones that an architecture should tackle and for prioritizing the
scenarios required by the stakeholders. In this context, architecture
evaluation is carried out manually, often involving long brainstorming sessions
to decide which are the most adequate quality scenarios. To reduce this effort
and make the assessment and selection of scenarios more efficient, we suggest
the usage of LLMs to partially automate evaluation activities. As a first step
to validate this hypothesis, this work studies MS Copilot as an LLM tool to
analyze quality scenarios suggested by students in a software architecture
course and compares the students' results with the assessment provided by the
LLM. Our initial study reveals that the LLM produces in most cases better and
more accurate results regarding the risks, sensitivity points and tradeoff
analysis of the quality scenarios. Overall, the use of generative AI has the
potential to partially automate and support the architecture evaluation tasks,
improving the human decision-making process.

TL;DR: RFCScan利用大语言模型检测网络协议实现与RFC规范间的功能错误，精度达81.9%，在6个实际协议中发现47个漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议实现中的功能错误可能导致严重后果，如路由故障和服务中断，传统静态分析工具难以检测这些错误。

Method: RFCScan由索引代理和检测代理组成，前者生成语义索引缩小扫描范围，后者通过需求驱动检索识别与RFC规范的不一致。

Result: 在6个实际网络协议实现中，RFCScan发现47个功能错误，其中20个已被开发者确认或修复，精度为81.9%。

Conclusion: RFCScan通过结合大语言模型和分层语义分析，有效检测网络协议实现中的功能错误，提升了协议可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Functional correctness is critical for ensuring the reliability and security
of network protocol implementations. Functional bugs, instances where
implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to
severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and
service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis
across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities
of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an
autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect
functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol
implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing
procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a
detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics,
generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the
scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively
collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually
identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively.
We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations.
RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs
have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码推理基准多基于合成数据或教育性问题，且聚焦粗粒度推理任务（如输入/输出预测），难以有效评估LLMs在实际软件工程场景中的表现。

Method: 从真实项目仓库收集Python/C/Java代码，通过执行测试用例收集执行轨迹，构建细粒度语义推理任务数据集，并对前沿LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: 现有模型在细粒度推理任务上表现显著不足，思维链提示等技巧虽有帮助，但模型缺乏代码语义理解能力仍是根本限制。

Conclusion: 除基准数据集外，工作还提供了执行追踪工具集，为未来基准构建和模型训练奠定基础，揭示了LLMs代码语义理解的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing
code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks.
Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic
datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning
tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in
evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose
CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained
code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world
code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world
repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their
execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained
semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models
to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as
chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in
LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides
dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing
framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for
fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark
construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化从自然语言用例中为UML类图添加行为方法是一个重要挑战，研究旨在评估LLM在此任务中的表现。

Method: 使用21个结构化废物管理用例，评估9个LLM在21个类、17个关系的无方法UML图中的表现，共生成90个图表（3,373个方法），并从六个指标进行评估。

Result: 所有LLM均能生成符合UML规范的PlantUML图，部分模型在方法覆盖和注释准确性上表现优异，但存在注释和签名不一致的问题。

Conclusion: LLM可作为软件设计中的协作伙伴，快速生成方法支持敏捷实践，但仍需人工监督以确保准确性和语义对齐。

Abstract: Automating the enrichment of UML class diagrams with behavioral methods from
natural language use cases is a significant challenge. This study evaluates
nine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21
classes, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A
total of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method
quantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types),
annotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity,
syntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across
models). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions.
Some models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others
showed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results
demonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent
naming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in
annotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering
and model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile
practices by enabling faster design iterations. Despite their capabilities,
human oversight is essential to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and semantic
alignment. This positions LLMs as collaborative partners in software design.
All experimental artifacts (\texttt{.puml}, \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.csv}) are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分类软件问题报告效率低且难以扩展，传统机器学习方法需要大量训练数据。研究旨在利用LLMs开发高效、少依赖数据的自动化分类方案。

Method: 研究选取两种主流LLMs（GPT-4o和DeepSeek R1），在多个数据集上比较其性能，并通过微调模型优化分类效果。

Result: GPT-4o在NLBSE 2024数据集上表现最佳，其微调后的F1分数达80.7%，比DeepSeek R1高20%。增大数据集规模未提升模型性能。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是GPT-4o）能有效实现软件问题自动分类，减少对大规模数据的依赖，为工程实践提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Effective prioritization of issue reports in software engineering helps to
optimize resource allocation and information recovery. However, manual issue
classification is laborious and lacks scalability. As an alternative, many open
source software (OSS) projects employ automated processes for this task, yet
this method often relies on large datasets for adequate training.
Traditionally, machine learning techniques have been used for issue
classification. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
powerful tools for addressing a range of software engineering challenges,
including code and test generation, mapping new requirements to legacy software
endpoints, and conducting code reviews. The following research investigates an
automated approach to issue classification based on LLMs. By leveraging the
capabilities of such models, we aim to develop a robust system for prioritizing
issue reports, mitigating the necessity for extensive training data while also
maintaining reliability in classification. In our research, we developed an
LLM-based approach for accurately labeling issues by selecting two of the most
prominent large language models. We then compared their performance across
multiple datasets. Our findings show that GPT-4o achieved the best results in
classifying issues from the NLBSE 2024 competition. Moreover, GPT-4o
outperformed DeepSeek R1, achieving an F1 score 20% higher when both models
were trained on the same dataset from the NLBSE 2023 competition, which was ten
times larger than the NLBSE 2024 dataset. The fine-tuned GPT-4o model attained
an average F1 score of 80.7%, while the fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 model achieved
59.33%. Increasing the dataset size did not improve the F1 score, reducing the
dependence on massive datasets for building an efficient solution to issue
classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code
migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains
insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration
Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs'
abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples
spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1)
identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting
changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments.
Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1
rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings
include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions,
which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical
inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended
migration environment. The datasets are available at

Conclusion: LLM可在严格审查下辅助生成合规智能合约的初始代码，所提指标为自动化及自优化开发流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Smart contracts can implement and automate parts of legal contracts, but
ensuring their legal compliance remains challenging. Existing approaches such
as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require
expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive
manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant
smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing
these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal
compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and
comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts
based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that
while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant
variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher
levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties
of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable
nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any
source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in
generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict
reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and
self-improving development workflows.

Motivation: 选择偏差会严重影响因果推断的有效性。现有方法如Bareinboim等提出的技术依赖于观测数据且计算复杂，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过结构因果模型(SCMs)显式构建反事实世界，分析选择机制从观测域到反事实域的传播，并利用部分无偏观测数据恢复实验数据中的因果效应。

Result: 推导出完整的图形与理论标准，证明实验分布不受选择偏差影响，并通过模拟研究验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为应用因果推断中缓解选择偏差提供了具体指导，拓展了现有技术的适用范围。

Abstract: Selection bias, arising from the systematic inclusion or exclusion of certain
samples, poses a significant challenge to the validity of causal inference.
While Bareinboim et al. introduced methods for recovering unbiased
observational and interventional distributions from biased data using partial
external information, the complexity of the backdoor adjustment and the
method's strong reliance on observational data limit its applicability in many
practical settings. In this paper, we formally discover the recoverability of
$P(Y^*_{x^*})$ under selection bias with experimental data. By explicitly
constructing counterfactual worlds via Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we
analyze how selection mechanisms in the observational world propagate to the
counterfactual domain. We derive a complete set of graphical and theoretical
criteria to determine that the experimental distribution remain unaffected by
selection bias. Furthermore, we propose principled methods for leveraging
partially unbiased observational data to recover $P(Y^*_{x^*})$ from biased
experimental datasets. Simulation studies replicating realistic research
scenarios demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, offering concrete
guidance for mitigating selection bias in applied causal inference.

Method: 首先训练多个PINNs表示不同速度模型的频域散射波场，将网络参数展平为一维向量；然后使用自编码器学习这些参数的潜在表示；最后训练条件扩散模型存储潜在向量的分布，以速度模型为条件生成新参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著加速了训练过程，并在分布内和分布外速度模型场景中均保持了高准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在扩散策略有效解决了PINNs在地震波场建模中的训练效率问题，为快速初始化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful framework for
seismic wavefield modeling, yet they typically require time-consuming
retraining when applied to different velocity models. Moreover, their training
can suffer from slow convergence due to the complexity of of the wavefield
solution. To address these challenges, we introduce a latent diffusion-based
strategy for rapid and effective PINN initialization. First, we train multiple
PINNs to represent frequency-domain scattered wavefields for various velocity
models, then flatten each trained network's parameters into a one-dimensional
vector, creating a comprehensive parameter dataset. Next, we employ an
autoencoder to learn latent representations of these parameter vectors,
capturing essential patterns across diverse PINN's parameters. We then train a
conditional diffusion model to store the distribution of these latent vectors,
with the corresponding velocity models serving as conditions. Once trained,
this diffusion model can generate latent vectors corresponding to new velocity
models, which are subsequently decoded by the autoencoder into complete PINN
parameters. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly
accelerates training and maintains high accuracy across in-distribution and
out-of-distribution velocity scenarios.

### [602] [Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00191)
*Jiawei Chen,Lusi Li,Daniel Takabi,Masha Sosonkina,Rui Ning*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次探究了异质图神经网络（HGNNs）对后门攻击的脆弱性，并提出了一种新型攻击方法HGBA，通过关系型触发器实现高效隐蔽的攻击注入，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管HGNNs在建模复杂多类型关系方面表现出色，但其对后门攻击的脆弱性尚未被研究。现有图后门攻击在HGNNs上存在高攻击预算、低效激活和评估不准确三大问题。

Method: 提出HGBA攻击框架，采用基于关系的触发器机制，通过后门元路径连接触发节点与污染节点，支持两种灵活激活策略（自节点攻击和无差别攻击），并改进了攻击成功率评估协议。

Result: 实验表明HGBA在黑盒设置下远超现有方法，能以低预算高效攻击HGNNs，且对特征扰动和防御机制具有强鲁棒性。消融实验验证了触发节点选择和后门元路径策略的有效性。

Conclusion: HGBA首次揭示了HGNNs的后门风险，其关系型触发器机制可泛化至同质图任务，对安全关键领域构成广泛威胁。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex,
multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to
backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first
investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor
attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for
effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor
activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these
issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first
backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel
relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between
a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor
metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal
structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two
flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally,
we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of
attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses
multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings,
efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that
the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and
backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior
robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing
graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate
that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in
homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader
security-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过新兴的Model Context Protocol（MCP）解决大语言模型在数字取证中的透明度、可解释性和可重复性问题，并分析了其在不同取证场景中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在支持法医调查方面具有巨大潜力，但其广泛应用受到缺乏透明度、可解释性和可重复性的阻碍。本文旨在探讨MCP如何应对这些挑战，促进大语言模型在数字取证中的有效应用。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了MCP如何整合到各种取证场景中，从文物分析到生成可解释的报告，并提出了在取证环境中部署MCP服务器的技术和概念考虑。

Result: 分析表明，MCP不仅能够增强现有的取证工作流程，还能扩展大语言模型在取证中的应用范围。此外，引入了推理约束水平的概念，以描述特定MCP设计选择如何有意识地约束模型行为，从而提高可审计性和可追溯性。

Conclusion: MCP作为开发大语言模型辅助取证工作流程的基础组件具有显著潜力，能够提高透明度、可重复性和法律可辩护性，同时推动数字取证分析的自动化。然而，MCP的采用也可能带来未来的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models hold considerable promise for supporting forensic
investigations, but their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of
transparency, explainability, and reproducibility. This paper explores how the
emerging Model Context Protocol can address these challenges and support the
meaningful use of LLMs in digital forensics. Through a theoretical analysis, we
examine how MCP can be integrated across various forensic scenarios - ranging
from artifact analysis to the generation of interpretable reports. We also
outline both technical and conceptual considerations for deploying an MCP
server in forensic environments. Our analysis reveals a wide range of use cases
in which MCP not only strengthens existing forensic workflows but also
facilitates the application of LLMs to areas of forensics where their use was
previously limited. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the inference
constraint level - a way of characterizing how specific MCP design choices can
deliberately constrain model behavior, thereby enhancing both auditability and
traceability. Our insights demonstrate that MCP has significant potential as a
foundational component for developing LLM-assisted forensic workflows that are
not only more transparent, reproducible, and legally defensible, but also
represent a step toward increased automation in digital forensic analysis.
However, we also highlight potential challenges that the adoption of MCP may
pose for digital forensics in the future.

TL;DR: 压缩视觉语言投影器（VLP）存在显著安全漏洞，而未压缩VLP则表现出更强的安全性，研究为选择安全可靠的VLP提供了重要指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究主流视觉语言投影器（VLP）的安全影响，填补了现有研究中对VLP安全性评估的空白。

Method: 通过全面评估压缩和未压缩VLP的安全性，分析它们在对抗攻击下的表现。

Result: 压缩VLP存在严重漏洞，易受攻击；未压缩VLP安全性强，未引入额外漏洞。

Conclusion: 未压缩VLP在安全性上表现更优，建议研究者在构建视觉语言模型时优先考虑以增强安全性。

Abstract: The choice of a suitable visual language projector (VLP) is critical to the
successful training of large visual language models (LVLMs). Mainstream VLPs
can be broadly categorized into compressed and uncompressed projectors, and
each offering distinct advantages in performance and computational efficiency.
However, their security implications have not been thoroughly examined. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant differences in their security
profiles: compressed projectors exhibit substantial vulnerabilities, allowing
adversaries to successfully compromise LVLMs even with minimal knowledge of
structural information. In stark contrast, uncompressed projectors demonstrate
robust security properties and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities.
These findings provide critical guidance for researchers in selecting optimal
VLPs that enhance the security and reliability of visual language models. The
code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组基础模型（如ESM）在变异效应预测中表现出色，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用FGSM和软提示攻击两种方法，评估模型对对抗性基因和嵌入空间操作的鲁棒性。

Result: 软提示攻击导致ESM1b和ESM1v等大型模型性能显著下降，暴露了关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前基础模型的安全隐患，为提升基因组应用中的安全性和鲁棒性指明方向。

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM),
have demonstrated significant success in variant effect prediction. However,
their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we propose SafeGenes: a framework for Secure analysis of genomic foundation
models, leveraging adversarial attacks to evaluate robustness against both
engineered near-identical adversarial Genes and embedding-space manipulations.
In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two
approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM
introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt
attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without
modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a
comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation.
Targeted soft prompt attacks led to substantial performance degradation, even
in large models such as ESM1b and ESM1v. These findings expose critical
vulnerabilities in current foundation models, opening new research directions
toward improving their security and robustness in high-stakes genomic
applications such as variant effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交通系统依赖CPS，但自动化和互联性增加使其易受网络攻击，现有威胁建模框架范围有限且依赖专家知识。

Method: 提出基于LLM的TraCR-TMF框架，结合MITRE ATT&CK矩阵，采用三种方法（RAG、上下文学习、监督微调）识别威胁与对策。

Result: 框架在交通CPS应用中识别攻击技术的精确率达90%，并成功预测真实网络攻击事件中的多种利用方式。

Conclusion: TraCR-TMF有效降低对网络安全专家的依赖，适用于多种CPS领域。

Abstract: Modern transportation systems rely on cyber-physical systems (CPS), where
cyber systems interact seamlessly with physical systems like
transportation-related sensors and actuators to enhance safety, mobility, and
energy efficiency. However, growing automation and connectivity increase
exposure to cyber vulnerabilities. Existing threat modeling frameworks for
transportation CPS are often limited in scope, resource-intensive, and
dependent on significant cybersecurity expertise. To address these gaps, we
present TraCR-TMF (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling
Framework), a large language model (LLM)-based framework that minimizes expert
intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and
corresponding countermeasures by leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK matrix through
three LLM-based approaches: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method
requiring no expert input, (ii) an in-context learning approach requiring low
expert input, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning method requiring moderate
expert input. TraCR-TMF also maps attack paths to critical assets by analyzing
vulnerabilities using a customized LLM. The framework was evaluated in two
scenarios. First, it identified relevant attack techniques across
transportation CPS applications, with 90% precision as validated by experts.
Second, using a fine-tuned LLM, it successfully predicted multiple
exploitations including lateral movement, data exfiltration, and
ransomware-related encryption that occurred during a major real-world
cyberattack incident. These results demonstrate TraCR-TMF's effectiveness in
CPS threat modeling, its reduced reliance on cybersecurity expertise, and its
adaptability across CPS domains.

### [609] [Con Instruction: Universal Jailbreaking of Multimodal Large Language Models via Non-Textual Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00548)
*Jiahui Geng,Thy Thy Tran,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Con Instruction的新方法，通过生成对抗性图像或音频来攻击多模态语言模型（MLLMs），无需文本指令或预处理，成功绕过模型的安全机制，并在多个模型中实现了高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的攻击方法主要通过文本和对抗性图像结合来攻击MLLMs，而本文旨在探索MLLMs对非文本指令（如图像或音频）的理解能力，揭示其潜在的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出Con Instruction方法，通过优化对抗性示例使其在嵌入空间中与目标指令对齐，无需训练数据或文本预处理。同时引入攻击响应分类（ARC）框架评估攻击效果。

Result: Con Instruction在多个模型（如LLaVA-v1.5、InternVL等）上实现了最高攻击成功率（81.3%和86.6%），并发现现有防御技术存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs在非文本指令理解上的安全风险，提出了有效的攻击方法，并呼吁加强防御技术的研究。

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily
communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In
contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual
instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel
method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align
closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the
detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior
work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual
instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively
bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs
substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack
Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of
the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses
safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including
LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard
benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the
highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On
the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and
uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our
implementation is made publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文全面评估了GPT中知识文件泄露的风险，发现了五种泄露途径，并揭示了内置工具Code Interpreter的权限提升漏洞，导致95.95%的成功下载率。28.80%的泄露文件涉及版权问题，最后提出了保护GPT数据供应链的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着知识文件在大型语言模型（如GPTs）中的广泛应用，其泄露风险日益引起关注。现有研究表明，对抗性提示可诱导GPTs泄露知识文件内容，但尚不清楚是否存在其他泄露途径，尤其是在GPTs涉及客户端、服务器和数据库的复杂数据流中。

Method: 论文采用受数据安全态势管理（DSPM）启发的新工作流程，通过分析651,022条GPT元数据、11,820条数据流和1,466条响应，识别了五种知识文件泄露途径。

Result: 研究发现五种泄露途径（元数据、GPT初始化、检索、沙盒执行环境和提示），可泄露文件标题、内容、类型和大小等敏感数据。Code Interpreter的激活导致权限提升漏洞，使攻击者能以95.95%的成功率直接下载原始文件。28.80%的泄露文件涉及版权问题。

Conclusion: 论文为GPT构建者和平台提供商提供了保护数据供应链的具体解决方案，强调了加强GPT数据安全的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge files have been widely used in large language model (LLM) agents,
such as GPTs, to improve response quality. However, concerns about the
potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies
demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file
content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist,
particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and
databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of
knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security
Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820
flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT
initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These
vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as
titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool
Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling
adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success
rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted,
including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a
listed company. In the end, we provide actionable solutions for GPT builders
and platform providers to secure the GPT data supply chain.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了提示注入如何导致工具调用代理泄露任务执行中观察到的个人数据，通过虚构银行代理开发基于数据流的攻击，并整合到AgentDojo基准测试中。结果显示，LLMs在攻击下效用下降15-50个百分点，平均攻击成功率约20%，部分防御措施可降至零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于大型语言模型（LLMs）提示注入的基准测试主要关注通用任务和攻击，对更复杂的威胁（如数据泄露）提供的信息有限。本文旨在探讨提示注入如何导致工具调用代理泄露个人数据。

Method: 使用虚构的银行代理开发基于数据流的攻击，并将其整合到AgentDojo（一个最近的代理安全性基准测试）中。同时创建了一个更丰富的人类-AI银行对话合成数据集。

Result: 在16个用户任务中，LLMs在攻击下的效用下降15-50个百分点，平均攻击成功率约20%，部分防御措施可降至零。大多数LLMs即使被攻击成功，也避免泄露高度敏感数据（如密码），但仍易泄露其他个人数据。

Conclusion: 任务类型、代理性能和防御效果之间存在交互作用，数据提取或授权工作流任务表现出最高的攻击成功率。现有内置防御措施无法完全防止数据泄露。

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have
primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into
more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt
injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during
task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based
attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic
security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of
human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a
15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack
success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most
LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly
sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain
vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password
leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional
personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is
around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.
Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely
resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs,
highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense
efficacy.

Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being increasingly used in safety-critical
applications, how can an adversary manipulate the scene to cause harm? We
introduce CLOAK, the first attack that leverages view-dependent Gaussian
appearances - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed
adversarial content visible only from specific viewpoints. We further
demonstrate DAGGER, a targeted adversarial attack directly perturbing 3D
Gaussians without access to underlying training data, deceiving multi-stage
object detectors e.g., Faster R-CNN, through established methods such as
projected gradient descent. These attacks highlight underexplored
vulnerabilities in 3DGS, introducing a new potential threat to robotic learning
for autonomous navigation and other safety-critical 3DGS applications.

TL;DR: PackHero是一种新型静态方法，通过图匹配网络和聚类技术高效识别加壳程序，仅需少量样本即可实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加壳识别方法存在局限性：基于签名的方法灵活性不足且难以应对动态规避，而机器学习方法需要大量训练数据，扩展性和适应性较差。因此，开发一种准确且适应性强的加壳识别方法成为亟待解决的问题。

Method: PackHero采用静态分析方法，结合图匹配网络（Graph Matching Network）和聚类技术，对已知加壳程序的调用图（Call Graphs）进行匹配和分组。

Result: 在公开数据集上测试表明，PackHero仅需每个加壳器10个样本即可达到93.7%的宏平均F1分数，100个样本时提升至98.3%。其在处理虚拟化加壳器（如Themida/Winlicense）时召回率达到100%，优于现有基于签名的方法。

Conclusion: PackHero在样本需求量和性能稳定性上显著优于其他机器学习工具，同时达到了当前最先进的基于签名工具的性能水平，尤其在处理复杂加壳器时表现突出。

Abstract: Anti-analysis techniques, particularly packing, challenge malware analysts,
making packer identification fundamental. Existing packer identifiers have
significant limitations: signature-based methods lack flexibility and struggle
against dynamic evasion, while Machine Learning approaches require extensive
training data, limiting scalability and adaptability. Consequently, achieving
accurate and adaptable packer identification remains an open problem. This
paper presents PackHero, a scalable and efficient methodology for identifying
packers using a novel static approach. PackHero employs a Graph Matching
Network and clustering to match and group Call Graphs from programs packed with
known packers. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset of malware and
benign samples packed with various packers, demonstrating its effectiveness and
scalability across varying sample sizes. PackHero achieves a macro-average
F1-score of 93.7% with just 10 samples per packer, improving to 98.3% with 100
samples. Notably, PackHero requires fewer samples to achieve stable performance
compared to other Machine Learning-based tools. Overall, PackHero matches the
performance of State-of-the-art signature-based tools, outperforming them in
handling Virtualization-based packers such as Themida/Winlicense, with a recall
of 100%.

Abstract: Graph-based frameworks are often used in network hardening to help a cyber
defender understand how a network can be attacked and how the best defenses can
be deployed. However, incorporating network connectivity parameters in the
attack graph, reasoning about the attack graph when we do not have access to
complete information, providing system administrator suggestions in an
understandable format, and allowing them to do what-if analysis on various
scenarios and attacker motives is still missing. We fill this gap by presenting
SPEAR, a formal framework with tool support for security posture evaluation and
analysis that keeps human-in-the-loop. SPEAR uses the causal formalism of AI
planning to model vulnerabilities and configurations in a networked system. It
automatically converts network configurations and vulnerability descriptions
into planning models expressed in the Planning Domain Definition Language
(PDDL). SPEAR identifies a set of diverse security hardening strategies that
can be presented in a manner understandable to the domain expert. These allow
the administrator to explore the network hardening solution space in a
systematic fashion and help evaluate the impact and compare the different
solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by integrating
visual information and other types, thus aligning more closely with the nature
of human intelligence, which processes a variety of data forms beyond just
text. Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains
a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based
jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging
existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the
integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified
multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative
image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal
adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of
image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also
validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality
undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable
context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and
InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues,
highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated
multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety
measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of
security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal
capabilities.

Motivation: 标准MCP协议存在工具投毒和Rug Pull等安全漏洞，需建立更可靠的LLM与外部工具交互生态。

Method: 设计ETDI扩展：引入加密身份验证、版本化工具定义、OAuth 2.0权限管理，并添加基于策略的动态访问控制。

Result: 构建了分层安全框架，实现工具能力的运行时策略评估，超越静态OAuth范围限制。

Conclusion: ETDI为LLM与外部工具的交互提供了更安全、可控的解决方案，推动可信AI生态系统发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) plays a crucial role in extending the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling integration with
external tools and data sources. However, the standard MCP specification
presents significant security vulnerabilities, notably Tool Poisoning and Rug
Pull attacks. This paper introduces the Enhanced Tool Definition Interface
(ETDI), a security extension designed to fortify MCP. ETDI incorporates
cryptographic identity verification, immutable versioned tool definitions, and
explicit permission management, often leveraging OAuth 2.0. We further propose
extending MCP with fine-grained, policy-based access control, where tool
capabilities are dynamically evaluated against explicit policies using a
dedicated policy engine, considering runtime context beyond static OAuth
scopes. This layered approach aims to establish a more secure, trustworthy, and
controllable ecosystem for AI applications interacting with LLMs and external
tools.

Abstract: As malware continues to become more complex and harder to detect, Malware
Analysis needs to continue to evolve to stay one step ahead. One promising key
area approach focuses on using system calls and API Calls, the core
communication between user applications and the operating system and their
kernels. These calls provide valuable insight into how software or programs
behaves, making them an useful tool for spotting suspicious or harmful activity
of programs and software. This chapter takes a deep down look at how system
calls are used in malware detection and classification, covering techniques
like static and dynamic analysis, as well as sandboxing. By combining these
methods with advanced techniques like machine learning, statistical analysis,
and anomaly detection, researchers can analyze system call patterns to tell the
difference between normal and malicious behavior. The chapter also explores how
these techniques are applied across different systems, including Windows,
Linux, and Android, while also looking at the ways sophisticated malware tries
to evade detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various
tasks, yet concerns about their safety and security have emerged. In
particular, they pose risks in generating harmful content and vulnerability to
jailbreaking attacks. To analyze and monitor machine learning models,
model-based analysis has demonstrated notable potential in stateful deep neural
networks, yet suffers from scalability issues when extending to LLMs due to
their vast feature spaces. In this paper, we propose ReGA, a model-based
analysis framework with representation-guided abstraction, to safeguard LLMs
against harmful prompts and generations. By leveraging safety-critical
representations, which are low-dimensional directions emerging in hidden states
that indicate safety-related concepts, ReGA effectively addresses the
scalability issue when constructing the abstract model for safety modeling. Our
comprehensive evaluation shows that ReGA performs sufficiently well in
distinguishing between safe and harmful inputs, achieving an AUROC of 0.975 at
the prompt level and 0.985 at the conversation level. Additionally, ReGA
exhibits robustness to real-world attacks and generalization across different
safety perspectives, outperforming existing safeguard paradigms in terms of
interpretability and scalability. Overall, ReGA serves as an efficient and
scalable solution to enhance LLM safety by integrating representation
engineering with model-based abstraction, paving the way for new paradigms to
utilize software insights for AI safety. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前气候模型依赖初始条件的准确性，但地球系统的混沌特性使得微小不确定性会随时间指数级放大。全球尺度和百年时间尺度上的数据稀疏性进一步加剧了这一问题。论文旨在解决观测数据不足和模型内部变异性带来的不确定性。

Method: 采用条件数据填补框架，结合预克里金掩模引导的扩散模型，从极稀疏（最低1%覆盖率）的观测数据中推断完整温度场。

Result: 在美国南部大平原2018-2020年夏季午后温度场的实验中，该方法在不同观测密度下（从条带数据到单点传感器）均表现出高精度重建能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效填补历史和实时气候数据缺口，为再分析和预测提供可靠支持。

Abstract: The large underlying assumption of climate models today relies on the basis
of a "confident" initial condition, a reasonably plausible snapshot of the
Earth for which all future predictions depend on. However, given the inherently
chaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive
dependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to
exponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly
salient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data
gaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold:
(1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2)
internal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the
models themselves.
  In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing
information by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work
builds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a
conditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields
from as little as 1% observational coverage. The method leverages a diffusion
model guided by a prekriged mask, effectively inferring the full-state fields
from minimal data points. We validate our framework over the Southern Great
Plains, focusing on afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM) temperature fields during the
summer months of 2018-2020. Across varying observational densities--from swath
data to isolated in-situ sensors--our model achieves strong reconstruction
accuracy, highlighting its potential to fill in critical data gaps in both
historical reanalysis and real-time forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: The growing importance of intraday electricity trading in Europe calls for
improved price forecasting and tailored decision-support tools. In this paper,
we propose a novel generative neural network model to generate probabilistic
path forecasts for intraday electricity prices and use them to construct
effective trading strategies for Germany's continuous-time intraday market. Our
method demonstrates competitive performance in terms of statistical evaluation
metrics compared to two state-of-the-art statistical benchmark approaches. To
further assess its economic value, we consider a realistic fixed-volume trading
scenario and propose various strategies for placing market sell orders based on
the path forecasts. Among the different trading strategies, the price paths
generated by our generative model lead to higher profit gains than the
benchmark methods. Our findings highlight the potential of generative machine
learning tools in electricity price forecasting and underscore the importance
of economic evaluation.

Motivation: 为了提高移动接受超启发式算法在局部最优解中的跳出效率，并优化其在经典基准函数（如Cliff和Jump函数）上的运行时间。

Method: 1. 使用简单的两状态马尔可夫链来选择仅改进或任意移动接受操作符；2. 用仅接受恶化的操作符替换全移动接受操作符。

Result: 改进后的算法在Jump函数上的运行时间从Ω(n^(2m-1))降至O(n^(m+1))，在SEQOPT_k类函数上实现了O(n^(k+1) log n)的优秀运行时间。

Conclusion: 通过引入马尔可夫链和仅接受恶化操作符，显著提升了超启发式算法在多种基准函数上的性能，尤其是在跳出局部最优解方面表现出色。

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave
local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial
Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this
algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of
benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i)
Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance
operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This
modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter
$m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves
acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a,
counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature.
However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in
leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3
\log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good
runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic
on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large
number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the
commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对记忆的生物学基础已有大量研究，但经验如何在大脑中被编码、存储和检索的具体机制仍不完全清楚。印迹理论认为稀疏神经元群体通过持久的物理和生化变化支持长期记忆，但缺乏整合生物学发现与机制模型的综合计算框架。

Conclusion: 论文为印迹研究建立了理论框架，并提出了未来探索记忆机制的研究路线，对记忆相关疾病的诊断和治疗具有潜在意义。

Abstract: Despite substantial research into the biological basis of memory, the precise
mechanisms by which experiences are encoded, stored, and retrieved in the brain
remain incompletely understood. A growing body of evidence supports the engram
theory, which posits that sparse populations of neurons undergo lasting
physical and biochemical changes to support long-term memory. Yet, a
comprehensive computational framework that integrates biological findings with
mechanistic models remains elusive. This work synthesizes insights from
cellular neuroscience and computational modeling to address key challenges in
engram research: how engram neurons are identified and manipulated; how
synaptic plasticity mechanisms contribute to stable memory traces; and how
sparsity promotes efficient, interference-resistant representations. Relevant
computational approaches -- such as sparse regularization, engram gating, and
biologically inspired architectures like Sparse Distributed Memory and spiking
neural networks -- are also examined. Together, these findings suggest that
memory efficiency, capacity, and stability emerge from the interaction of
plasticity and sparsity constraints. By integrating neurobiological and
computational perspectives, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical
foundation for engram research and proposes a roadmap for future inquiry into
the mechanisms underlying memory, with implications for the diagnosis and
treatment of memory-related disorders.

Result: 结果显示，MiniLM-v6在结合LLM重排序时表现优于BGE-Large，尤其在多信号融合和LLM对齐方面表现更佳。

Conclusion: 结论指出，RAG系统选择嵌入模型时应优先考虑多信号融合和LLM对齐的兼容性，而非单纯依赖更大的模型，这有助于降低计算需求并提升检索效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of embedding models in tri-modal hybrid
retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. We investigate the
fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing
on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to
conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6
outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking
within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact,
FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval
quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is
particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better
alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings
suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize
compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying
solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements
while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: RLMultimodalRec通过自适应多模态融合与轻量图编码，实现了高效可解释的推荐，具备实际部署价值。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate
the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by
incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual
descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a
unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often
rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to
adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational
overhead.
  In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular
recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive
multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to
dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling
fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer
LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating
embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear
transformations.
  We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain.
Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms
several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware,
and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant
improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and
interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment.

Conclusion: GLEN通过创新的索引学习和推理机制，有效解决了生成式检索的关键挑战，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval,
aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query.
While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index
structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the
discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and
identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses
difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical
iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic
lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to
learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and
documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using
identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental
results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance
against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets,
e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external
evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations
of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain
inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding
fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial
inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in
RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into
retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs.
We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context
filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by
comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering
tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and
benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness
testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring
trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency
and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying
open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval
architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over
multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey
aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation
for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

scenarios where the training data is static, thus limiting its applications to
dynamic scenarios where new training data emerges over time. IR methods
generally encode a huge corpus of documents to low-dimensional embeddings and
store them in a database index. During retrieval, a semantic search over the
corpus is performed and the document whose embedding is most similar to the
query embedding is returned. When updating an embedding model with new training
data, using the already indexed corpus is suboptimal due to the
non-compatibility issue, since the model which was used to obtain the
embeddings of the corpus has changed. While re-indexing of old corpus documents
using the updated model enables compatibility, it requires much higher
computation and time. Thus, it is critical to study how the already indexed
corpus can still be effectively used without the need of re-indexing. In this
work, we establish a continual learning benchmark with large-scale datasets and
continually train dense retrieval embedding models on query-document pairs from
new datasets in each task and observe forgetting on old tasks due to
significant drift of embeddings. We employ embedding distillation on both query
and document embeddings to maintain stability and propose a novel query drift
compensation method during retrieval to project new model query embeddings to
the old embedding space. This enables compatibility with previously indexed
corpus embeddings extracted using the old model and thus reduces the
forgetting. We show that the proposed method significantly improves performance
without any re-indexing. Code is available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解密集嵌入的新框架，使DPR模型具有可解释性，并进一步提出了概念级稀疏检索（CL-SR）框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集段落检索（DPR）模型虽然性能强大，但缺乏可解释性。本文旨在解决这一问题，使密集嵌入和查询-文档相似性得分能够被人类理解。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解密集嵌入为可解释的潜在概念，并为每个概念生成自然语言描述。进一步提出概念级稀疏检索（CL-SR）框架，直接利用潜在概念作为索引单元。

Result: CL-SR在索引空间和计算效率上表现优异，同时在词汇和语义不匹配的情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架成功地将密集嵌入的语义表达能力与稀疏表示的透明性和效率相结合，为DPR模型提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) models suffer
from a lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a novel
interpretability framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to
decompose previously uninterpretable dense embeddings from DPR models into
distinct, interpretable latent concepts. We generate natural language
descriptions for each latent concept, enabling human interpretations of both
the dense embeddings and the query-document similarity scores of DPR models. We
further introduce Concept-Level Sparse Retrieval (CL-SR), a retrieval framework
that directly utilizes the extracted latent concepts as indexing units. CL-SR
effectively combines the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the
transparency and efficiency of sparse representations. We show that CL-SR
achieves high index-space and computational efficiency while maintaining robust
performance across vocabulary and semantic mismatches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索器通常依赖于在纯文本上预训练的语言模型，由于领域不对齐和结构忽视，限制了其在图检索增强生成中的有效性。

Method: GPR直接在知识图谱上进行预训练，通过LLM引导的图增强将自然语言问题与相关子图对齐，并采用结构感知目标学习细粒度检索策略。

Result: 在两个数据集、三个LLM主干和五个基线上的实验表明，GPR在检索质量和下游生成方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: GPR作为一种稳健的检索解决方案，有效提升了图检索增强生成的性能。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on
graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language
models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain
misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose
GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR
aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided
graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn
fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM
backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both
retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as
a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

TL;DR: BMEmbed通过BM25检索结果构建监督信号，提升通用文本嵌入模型在私有数据集上的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在私有数据集（如公司专有数据）上表现不佳，因这些数据包含专业术语和行话。

Method: 利用BM25关键词检索技术，从检索结果排名中构建监督信号，以适配模型到私有数据集。

Result: BMEmbed在多个领域、数据集和模型上均显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: BM25信号通过促进对齐和均匀性改进嵌入，验证了该方法在领域特定数据适配中的价值。

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding
models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their
effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g.,
company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology
and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting
general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the
well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct
supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to
facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains,
datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance.
Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute
to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the
value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release
the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the

TL;DR: 论文提出Conv2Query框架，通过将对话上下文映射为适合ad-hoc检索器的查询，显著提升了对话主动搜索（PSC）的检索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PSC方法直接使用对话上下文作为ad-hoc检索器的输入，但由于ad-hoc检索器预训练时使用的是简短查询，而PSC输入较长且噪声多，导致检索质量受限。

Method: 提出Conv2Query框架，将对话上下文转换为适合ad-hoc检索器的查询，可直接用于现成检索器或进一步微调。

Result: 在两个PSC数据集上的实验表明，Conv2Query显著提升了ad-hoc检索器的性能，无论是直接使用还是微调后使用。

Conclusion: Conv2Query通过弥合ad-hoc检索与PSC的输入差异，有效提升了对话主动搜索的检索效果。

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in
formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant
information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly
uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further
fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on
short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This
input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While
fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input
gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query
framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap
between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into
ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc
retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two
PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers'
performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法在隐式物品关系建模和冗长信息利用上存在不足。

Method: 结合语义-词汇转换编码隐式关系，采用多粒度延迟融合减少信息损失。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上Recall@5提升11.5-16.0%，NDCG@5提升5.3-13.6%。

Conclusion: GRAM通过创新设计有效解决了生成式推荐的关键挑战。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the
extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations
into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key
limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing
rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a
Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM),
introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical
translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item
relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present
multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal
information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts,
delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative
recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in
Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5. The source code is available at

Motivation: 长用户历史对推荐系统极具价值，但传统端到端序列建模方法在数据中心功耗和GPU资源消耗上成本过高。

Method: 采用离线嵌入替代端到端优化，提出多切片与总结策略生成表征用户长期稳定兴趣的通用嵌入（最长70,000/平均40,000历史行为）。

Result: DV365嵌入在Instagram先进注意力序列模型基础上实现显著增益，已在15个生产模型中稳定运行超过1年。

Conclusion: 该方法以低成本实现了超长用户序列建模，生成的通用嵌入具有强扩展性和实战有效性。

Abstract: Long user history is highly valuable signal for recommendation systems, but
effectively incorporating it often comes with high cost in terms of data center
power consumption and GPU. In this work, we chose offline embedding over
end-to-end sequence length optimization methods to enable extremely long user
sequence modeling as a cost-effective solution, and propose a new user
embedding learning strategy, multi-slicing and summarization, that generates
highly generalizable user representation of user's long-term stable interest.
History length we encoded in this embedding is up to 70,000 and on average
40,000. This embedding, named as DV365, is proven highly incremental on top of
advanced attentive user sequence models deployed in Instagram. Produced by a
single upstream foundational model, it is launched in 15 different models
across Instagram and Threads with significant impact, and has been production
battle-proven for >1 year since our first launch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中文档库持续演化，可能导致稠密检索器的训练分布发生偏移。若不及时更新，新文档的索引会降低未来查询的检索性能。因此需提前预测文档集是否超出分布(OOD)，以主动管理检索器更新。

Method: 提出无监督方法GradNormIR，利用梯度范数有效检测OOD文档集，无需人工标注即可判断是否需要更新检索器。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中，GradNormIR能及时触发稠密检索器更新，显著提升动态文档集合中的检索鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为稠密检索器的主动更新提供了有效解决方案，通过OOD检测避免了潜在检索失效，对维护健壮的检索系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve
relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However,
real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original
training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining,
indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future
queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is
critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a
novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative
to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to
proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures.
We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms
to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark
demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in
evolving document collections, significantly enhancing retrieval robustness and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单槽推荐系统只能采用逐点建模，无法直接捕捉物品间的排序信息，且用户内在倾向易成为模型捷径偏差，导致用户-物品偏好挖掘不足。

Method: Breaker模型集成用户表征聚类的辅助任务和基于聚类的多塔偏好建模结构，采用延迟参数更新机制实现端到端联合训练。

Result: 离线和在线实验表明，该方法优于基线模型，目前已在美团平台日服务数千万用户。

Conclusion: 通过聚类增强用户侧任务复杂度，Breaker有效消除了用户内在倾向的捷径偏差，提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: In a single-slot recommendation system, users are only exposed to one item at
a time, and the system cannot collect user feedback on multiple items
simultaneously. Therefore, only pointwise modeling solutions can be adopted,
focusing solely on modeling the likelihood of clicks or conversions for items
by users to learn user-item preferences, without the ability to capture the
ranking information among different items directly. However, since user-side
information is often much more abundant than item-side information, the model
can quickly learn the differences in user intrinsic tendencies, which are
independent of the items they are exposed to. This can cause these intrinsic
tendencies to become a shortcut bias for the model, leading to insufficient
mining of the most concerned user-item preferences. To solve this challenge, we
introduce the Breaker model. Breaker integrates an auxiliary task of user
representation clustering with a multi-tower structure for cluster-specific
preference modeling. By clustering user representations, we ensure that users
within each cluster exhibit similar characteristics, which increases the
complexity of the pointwise recommendation task on the user side. This forces
the multi-tower structure with cluster-driven parameter learning to better
model user-item preferences, ultimately eliminating shortcut biases related to
user intrinsic tendencies. In terms of training, we propose a delayed parameter
update mechanism to enhance training stability and convergence, enabling
end-to-end joint training of the auxiliary clustering and classification tasks.
Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the
baselines. It has already been deployed and is actively serving tens of
millions of users daily on Meituan, one of the most popular e-commerce
platforms for services.

TL;DR: 本文提出了分支切割算法中学习选择切割平面的样本复杂度下界，并验证了间隙闭合分数作为优化分支切割树规模的有效代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，数据驱动方法被用于提升分支切割算法中的决策质量，如分支和切割平面选择。然而，现有研究缺乏对学习切割平面选择的理论分析，尤其是样本复杂度的下界。

Method: 作者针对两种切割质量评分函数（分支切割树规模和间隙闭合）推导了样本复杂度下界，并通过图神经网络在整数规划模型上的实验验证理论结果。

Result: 研究证明学习切割选择需要与通用目标函数学习相当的样本量，且间隙闭合分数能有效代理分支切割树规模的优化。理论下界与神经网络的上界接近吻合。

Conclusion: 该工作首次为学习切割框架建立了理论下界，并通过实证表明间隙闭合分数的实用性，为整数规划中切割选择提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In the recent years, branch-and-cut algorithms have been the target of
data-driven approaches designed to enhance the decision making in different
phases of the algorithm such as branching, or the choice of cutting planes
(cuts). In particular, for cutting plane selection two score functions have
been proposed in the literature to evaluate the quality of a cut:
branch-and-cut tree size and gap closed. In this paper, we present new sample
complexity lower bounds, valid for both scores. We show that for a wide family
of classes $\mathcal{F}$ that maps an instance to a cut, learning over an
unknown distribution of the instances to minimize those scores requires at
least (up to multiplicative constants) as many samples as learning from the
same class function $\mathcal{F}$ any generic target function (using square
loss). Our results also extend to the case of learning from a restricted set of
cuts, namely those from the Simplex tableau. To the best of our knowledge,
these constitute the first lower bounds for the learning-to-cut framework. We
compare our bounds to known upper bounds in the case of neural networks and
show they are nearly tight. We illustrate our results with a graph neural
network selection evaluated on set covering and facility location integer
programming models and we empirically show that the gap closed score is an
effective proxy to minimize the branch-and-cut tree size. Although the gap
closed score has been extensively used in the integer programming literature,
this is the first principled analysis discussing both scores at the same time
both theoretically and computationally.

Motivation: 在不稳定系统中收集信息数据具有挑战性，因为不稳定性会导致轨迹迅速增长或失控。

Method: 采用自适应采样方案，在生成数据的同时稳定系统，避免数据收集过程中的不稳定性。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法所需数据量比非引导数据生成少一个数量级，适用于边缘情况和极限状态。

Conclusion: 该方法为在难以收集数据的场景下稳定系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning stabilizing controllers from data is an important task in
engineering applications; however, collecting informative data is challenging
because unstable systems often lead to rapidly growing or erratic trajectories.
In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while
simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data
collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets
that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical
experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive
sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer
data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed
approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states
where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.

teams in rapidly spinning up and tearing down self-service data and compute
infrastructure, to experiment with new data analytic tools, and deploy data
products into operational use. This paper proposes a key piece of the solution
to the overall problem, in the form of an on-demand self-service data-platform
infrastructure to empower de-centralised data teams to build data products on
top of centralised templates, policies and governance. The core innovation is
an efficient method to leverage immutable container operating systems and
infrastructure-as-code methodologies for creating, from scratch, vendor-neutral
and short-lived Kubernetes clusters on-premises and in any cloud environment.
Our proposed approach can serve as a repeatable, portable and cost-efficient
alternative or complement to commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings,
and this is particularly important in supporting interoperability in complex
data mesh environments with a mix of modern and legacy compute infrastructure.

Motivation: 急诊科老年患者常缺乏治疗目标记录，临床团队在进行严重疾病对话时面临数据碎片化、时间压力等障碍，需探索AI支持的可能性。

Method: 通过访谈2名领域专家和9名急诊临床团队成员，采用主题分析法总结四阶段工作流程及需求。

Result: 识别出严重疾病对话的四个阶段（识别、准备、进行、记录）及各阶段的挑战，临床团队对AI辅助信息整合和文档自动化有需求但强调保持人文连接。

Conclusion: 研究为急诊科严重疾病对话提供了实证基础，并提出了符合临床实践的高风险环境AI设计准则。

Abstract: Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams
and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals,
and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these
conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not
align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when
conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency
Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented
treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support
opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED
clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a
four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation,
conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each
stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time
constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While
participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis,
conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving
human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI
tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices.
This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness
conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical
environments.

Abstract: Statistical inference in physics is often based on samples from a generator
(sometimes referred to as a ``forward model") that emulate experimental data
and depend on parameters of the underlying theory. Modern machine learning has
supercharged this workflow to enable high-dimensional and unbinned analyses to
utilize much more information than ever before. We propose a general framework
for describing the integration of machine learning with generators called
Generator Based Inference (GBI). A well-studied special case of this setup is
Simulation Based Inference (SBI) where the generator is a physics-based
simulator. In this work, we examine other methods within the GBI toolkit that
use data-driven methods to build the generator. In particular, we focus on
resonant anomaly detection, where the generator describing the background is
learned from sidebands. We show how to perform machine learning-based parameter
estimation in this context with data-derived generators. This transforms the
statistical outputs of anomaly detection to be directly interpretable and the
performance on the LHCO community benchmark dataset establishes a new

### [645] [Unfolding Boxes with Local Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01079)
*Long Qian,Eric Wang,Bernardo Subercaseaux,Marijn J. H. Heule*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基于SAT的方法，通过替换全局约束为局部约束，显著提升了多面体展开问题的计算和枚举效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多面体展开问题时，由于全局约束（如图连通性或无环性）的存在，难以有效编码和求解，限制了计算规模。

Method: 提出了一种新的SAT编码方法，用具有更好传播特性的简单局部约束替代全局约束。

Result: 新方法将计算规模从面积88提升到150以上，枚举规模从30提升到60，并否定了Xu等人关于三个多面体最小展开面积的猜想。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了多面体展开问题的可扩展性，为相关领域的研究提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be
folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational
approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and
decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that
existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints
(e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode
effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a
new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local
constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach
dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common
box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings
of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while
previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area
30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the
smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a
conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过分布式训练和个性化推理解决LLM辅助硬件设计中的数据不足、质量参差和效率低下问题，显著提升了设计生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的硬件设计质量无法满足实际部署需求，主要受限于数据稀缺性、质量不均和推理效率低三大挑战。

Method: 1) 采用分层分布式训练机制利用私有设计数据；2) 通过用户定义指标优化模型聚合；3) 提出Trueput指标并实施个性化推理加速策略。

Result: 框架在经典和量子基准测试中实现语义准确率提升33%~50%，速度加快2.3倍，效果随任务难度变化。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架作为现有方法的正交增强方案，能有效突破LLM辅助硬件设计的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI
techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in
LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical
digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this
direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the
requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical
challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design
generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate
inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper
introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring
decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we
propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical
decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To
mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities
in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation.
The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and
quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware
generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized
inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both
classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for
hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our
framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$
times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了模拟内存计算（AIMC）中设备和电路的非理想性对深度学习任务精度的影响，提出了一个数学模型来预测矩阵向量乘法（MVM）操作的输出，并通过实验验证了其准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟内存计算（AIMC）可以大幅提升深度学习的能效，但模拟域中的设备和电路非理想性会降低神经网络的精度。论文旨在量化这些影响并开发一个数学模型来预测其行为。

Method: 论文开发了一个数学模型来捕捉瞬时电流IR-drop和ADC量化效应，并基于实验测量推导了PCM读取噪声的统计模型。这些模型被集成到PyTorch框架中，用于评估对BERT和ALBERT Transformer网络精度的影响。

Result: 研究表明，使用简单高斯噪声的硬件感知微调可以抵抗ADC量化和PCM读取噪声的影响，但对IR-drop效果有限。IR-drop的非线性和时间依赖性使其难以通过简单噪声模拟来应对。

Conclusion: 论文指出，简单的训练方法无法有效应对IR-drop的影响，未来需要更复杂的训练方法，如结合Tile-circuit模型，以实现大型神经网络在AIMC硬件上的稳健部署。

Abstract: Analog In-Memory Compute (AIMC) can improve the energy efficiency of Deep
Learning by orders of magnitude. Yet analog-domain device and circuit
non-idealities -- within the analog ``Tiles'' performing Matrix-Vector Multiply
(MVM) operations -- can degrade neural-network task accuracy. We quantify the
impact of low-level distortions and noise, and develop a mathematical model for
Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations mapped to analog tiles.
Instantaneous-current IR-drop (the most significant circuit non-ideality), and
ADC quantization effects are fully captured by this model, which can predict
MVM tile-outputs both rapidly and accurately, as compared to much slower
rigorous circuit simulations. A statistical model of PCM read noise at
nanosecond timescales is derived from -- and matched against -- experimental
measurements. We integrate these (statistical) device and (deterministic)
circuit effects into a PyTorch-based framework to assess the accuracy impact on
the BERT and ALBERT Transformer networks. We show that hardware-aware
fine-tuning using simple Gaussian noise provides resilience against ADC
quantization and PCM read noise effects, but is less effective against IR-drop.
This is because IR-drop -- although deterministic -- is non-linear, is changing
significantly during the time-integration window, and is ultimately dependent
on all the excitations being introduced in parallel into the analog tile. The
apparent inability of simple Gaussian noise applied during training to properly
prepare a DNN network for IR-drop during inference implies that more complex
training approaches -- incorporating advances such as the Tile-circuit model
introduced here -- will be critical for resilient deployment of large neural
networks onto AIMC hardware.

rates of these models. Furthermore, we explore the impact of using the

Abstract: The rapid growth of large-language models (LLMs) is driving a new wave of
specialized hardware for inference. This paper presents the first
workload-centric, cross-architectural performance study of commercial AI
accelerators, spanning GPU-based chips, hybrid packages, and wafer-scale
engines. We compare memory hierarchies, compute fabrics, and on-chip
interconnects, and observe up to 3.7x performance variation across
architectures as batch size and sequence length change. Four scaling techniques
for trillion-parameter models are examined; expert parallelism offers an 8.4x
parameter-to-compute advantage but incurs 2.1x higher latency variance than
tensor parallelism. These findings provide quantitative guidance for matching
workloads to accelerators and reveal architectural gaps that next-generation

Result: 在16nm工艺下实现相同峰值性能时，面积效率提升37%，能效提升68%，且支持任意稀疏度的DNN加速。

Conclusion: VUSA架构具有应用无关性，是通用AI加速的可行方案，特别适合资源受限的边缘场景。

Abstract: Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to
enhance the efficiency of deep neural network DNN accelerators - particularly
important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a
systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity
to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical
multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37%

commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports
acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the
proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for
general-purpose AI acceleration.

Conclusion: FlexiSAGA通过灵活的架构设计和剪枝方法，有效提升了DNN在边缘设备上的推理效率，为稀疏和密集计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
have become an important tool for a wide range of applications, from computer
vision to natural language processing. However, the computational complexity of
DNN inference poses a significant challenge, particularly for processing on
resource-constrained edge devices. One promising approach to address this
challenge is the exploitation of sparsity in DNN operator weights.
  In this work, we present FlexiSAGA, an architecturally configurable and
dataflow-flexible AI hardware accelerator for the sparse and dense processing
of general matrix multiplications (GEMMs). FlexiSAGA supports seven different
sparse and dense dataflows, enabling efficient processing of resource intensive
DNN operators. Additionally, we propose a DNN pruning method specifically
tailored towards the FlexiSAGA architecture, allowing for near-optimal
processing of dense and sparse convolution and fully-connected operators,
facilitating a DNN/HW co-design flow. Our results show a whole DNN
sparse-over-dense inference speedup ranging from 1.41 up to 4.28, outperforming
commercial and literature-reported accelerator platforms.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为AVROBUSTBENCH的基准测试，用于评估音频-视觉模型在测试时的鲁棒性，并发现现有模型在双模态干扰下性能下降，同时提出了一种简单的在线测试时适应方法AV2C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒性基准测试主要关注单模态，无法全面评估音频-视觉模型在双模态同时变化时的鲁棒性。

Method: 作者引入了AVROBUSTBENCH基准测试，包含四个数据集，每种数据集包含75种双模态干扰，并提出了一种简单的测试时适应方法AV2C，通过惩罚高熵样本来实现跨模态融合。

Result: 实验表明，现有的监督和自监督音频-视觉模型在干扰严重性增加时鲁棒性下降，且现有的测试时适应方法在双模态干扰下改进有限，而AV2C在VGGSOUND-2C上取得了改进。

Conclusion: AVROBUSTBENCH有望推动更有效和鲁棒的音频-视觉测试时适应方法的发展。

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance,
their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully
understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities,
making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of
audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur
$\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models.
$\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets,
$\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and
$\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual
corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through
extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and
self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption
severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on
$\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements
in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a
simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing
high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We
hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective
and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有音频编解码器主要优化重建质量，但牺牲了下游任务中编码令牌的可建模性，MagiCodec旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: MagiCodec采用单层流式Transformer结构，结合高斯噪声注入和潜在正则化的多阶段训练流程，增强语义表达。

Result: 实验表明，MagiCodec在重建质量和下游任务中优于现有技术，生成的令牌呈现类似自然语言的Zipf分布。

Conclusion: MagiCodec在提升语义表达和重建质量方面表现优异，适用于基于语言模型的生成架构。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw
audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for
contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are
optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the
downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to
overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel
single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed
with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection
and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic
expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction
fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency
domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and
fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that
MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like
distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving
compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and
pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.

Result: 实验表明，深度伪造检测器在相同生成模型下的测试中准确率接近100%，但在跨域测试中性能显著下降，有时甚至接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒音频深度伪造检测器的重要性，这些检测器需要能够跨不同语言、说话人、生成方法和数据源保持泛化能力。XMAD-Bench基准测试已公开发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes,
making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft,
and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue,
with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these
methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples
from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To
this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual
audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In
our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio
sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a
challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can
be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate
a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors,
which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same
models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights
the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain
their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative
methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at
https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在主要训练于文本数据的情况下，能否通过提示生成音频，以理解其对听觉世界的潜在认知。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进方法：1) 音符生成 2) 环境声音生成 3) 人声生成，通过代码中介将文本转换为音频，并使用FAD和CLAP评分评估质量。

Result: LLMs能生成基础音频特征，但随着音频复杂度增加性能显著下降，显示其音频生成能力仍处于初级阶段。

Conclusion: LLMs对听觉世界存在潜在理解，但将其转化为实际音频输出的能力有限，需进一步研究提升文本型LLMs的音频生成质量。

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's
(LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to
which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in
textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the
complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and
3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as
an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces
the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated
audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can
generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity
of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent
understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this
understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research
into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated
audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in
generating audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有韵律控制方法依赖专用模块或额外训练，传统发音校正依赖音素词典，难以在低资源场景应用。

Method: 采用反事实激活编辑技术，通过操纵预训练TTS模型的内部表征实现事后控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效调整韵律特征并纠正发音错误，同时保持合成质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为不重新训练即可优化TTS输出提供了可能，填补了预训练模型与可编辑语音合成间的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech
naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and
mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often
depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity
for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction
relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in
low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a
model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a
pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation.
Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features
and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens
the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining,
bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for
applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content
generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency,
model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In
this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for
zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts
mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based
generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token
representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we
propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment,
and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and
Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably,
CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports
controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise
timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech

TL;DR: 提出文本引导的音频空间化框架TAS，通过文本提示灵活控制双耳音频生成，构建大规模数据集SpatialTAS，模型在模拟和真实数据上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频空间化方法在复杂多对象交互环境中缺乏灵活控制，需提升双耳音频生成的交互性和质量。

Method: 基于文本提示和3D空间位置引导的TAS框架，利用翻转声道音频增强，并构建376K样本的SpatialTAS数据集。

Result: 模型在模拟和真实数据集上表现优异，Llama-3.1-8B评估显示生成音频与文本空间语义一致性高。

Conclusion: 文本提示能灵活生成高质量、空间语义一致的双耳音频，为AR/VR等应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of
sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio
spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to
binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control
needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this,
we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes
flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and
comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and
large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses
376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our
model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and
relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms
existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating
superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model
based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between
our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task.
Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control
to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in
spatial locations. Dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自监督训练方法GRAM，用于提升音频基础模型在真实世界复杂声学场景中的表现，特别是在空间音频表征学习方面，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频基础模型主要在干燥、非空间、单声源的音频片段上进行训练和测试，这限制了它们在真实世界复杂场景中的应用效果，导致空间感知能力不足。

Method: 提出了一种自监督训练方法GRAM，适用于任何基于掩码的深度学习模型，通过训练具有Transformer和Mamba架构的两种先进模型来验证其有效性。

Result: GRAM在自然声学场景和空间音频表征学习任务中表现出色，缩小了干燥场景与自然场景之间的性能差距，并在声音定位任务上超过了现有的监督模型。

Conclusion: GRAM方法显著推进了音频基础模型在真实世界应用中的鲁棒性，特别是在自然声学场景和空间音频表征学习方面达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: While audio foundation models perform well on myriad of tasks from sound
classification to speech analysis, these models are trained and tested on dry,
non-spatial, single-source audio clips. This limits their success in real-world
situations and results in spatially unaware audio embeddings. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised training approach for
General-Purpose, Real-world Audio Models (GRAMs). The GRAM training approach
enables robust spatial audio representation learning for naturalistic, noisy
sound scenes and can be applied to any masking-based deep learning model. We
demonstrate the success of our approach by training two state-of-the-art
models, one with a transformer and one with a mamba backbone. We assess the
quality of the extracted audio representations from GRAMs using the original
version of the HEAR benchmark, a newly synthesized, naturalistic version of the
HEAR benchmark, and novel sound localization tasks based on HEAR benchmark
datasets. The results show that our approach minimizes the performance gap
between dry, non-spatial, single-source sound scenes and naturalistic sound
scenes for crucial tasks such as auditory scene analysis, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art audio foundation models at a fraction of the training
steps. Moreover, GRAMs show state-of-the-art performance on sound localization
tasks, exceeding even supervised sound localization models. In sum, the
proposed approach represents a significant advancement towards robust audio
foundation models for real-world applications with state-of-the-art performance
on naturalistic sound scenes as well as spatial audio representation learning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出FusionVAD框架，通过融合MFCC和预训练模型特征提升语音活动检测性能，实验表明简单融合策略优于复杂方法，性能超越现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨传统手工特征（MFCC）与预训练模型特征在语音活动检测中的互补性，寻求通过特征融合提升检测性能。

Method: 提出FusionVAD框架，采用三种融合策略（拼接、相加、交叉注意力）结合MFCC和6种预训练模型特征。

Result: 简单相加融合效果最佳，融合模型比单特征模型平均提升2.04%，计算效率优于交叉注意力方法。

Conclusion: MFCC与预训练模型特征具有互补性，简单特征融合可显著提升VAD鲁棒性且保持高效计算。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often
utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the
effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained
model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and
Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature
types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and
cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion
techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and
efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models,
highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our
best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across
multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These
results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更充分地利用目标时频(TF)单元及其周围TF单元的信息进行单通道语音增强，同时降低模型复杂度。

Method: 1) 子带模块捕获输入端的相邻频带信息；2) 深度滤波模块对输出端目标及周围TF单元进行联合滤波；3) 将深度滤波解耦为时域/频域分量并采用两阶段框架；4) 提出TAConv模块增强卷积特征提取。

Result: 实验表明HDF-Net能有效利用周围TF信息，在减少资源使用的情况下性能超越其他先进系统。

Conclusion: 分层深度滤波网络通过协同处理时频信息，实现了高效的单通道语音增强。

Abstract: This paper proposes a model that integrates sub-band processing and deep
filtering to fully exploit information from the target time-frequency (TF) bin
and its surrounding TF bins for single-channel speech enhancement. The sub-band
module captures surrounding frequency bin information at the input, while the
deep filtering module applies filtering at the output to both the target TF bin
and its surrounding TF bins. To further improve the model performance, we
decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a
two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction
at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen
convolutional feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed hierarchical deep filtering network (HDF-Net) effectively utilizes
surrounding TF bin information and outperforms other advanced systems while
using fewer resources.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段音频描述生成方法，结合多模态信息和大语言模型，创建大规模数据集FusionAudio，提升音频理解准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频描述方法缺乏细节和上下文准确性，受人类听觉感知启发，需整合跨模态信息进行精细音频场景分析。

Method: 两阶段流程：先用预训练模型提取多模态上下文线索，再用大语言模型合成生成详细音频描述。

Result: 构建包含120万详细描述和600万问答对的数据集FusionAudio，开发了音频-文本对齐更优的CLAP音频编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂音频环境提供了更细腻、准确的自动化理解路径，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio
understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack
fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on
limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration
from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and
performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage
automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models
to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and
visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then
synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and
context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the
proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2)
FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed
captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models
developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with
superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the
way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio
environments. Code and data can be found in

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在自编码器潜在空间内直接进行音频处理的新框架，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持音频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数音频处理操作仍低效地作用于原始波形或频谱表示，而非直接利用自编码器生成的紧凑潜在表示。

Method: 提出一种框架，完全在自编码器的潜在空间内执行音频处理操作，无需解码为原始音频格式，简化训练过程。

Result: 在带宽扩展和单声道到立体声上混实验中，实现了高达100倍的计算效率提升，同时保持与原始音频后处理相当的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为已采用自编码器的音频处理流程建立了更高效的范式，显著提升了各种音频任务的工作流程速度和资源效率。

Abstract: Neural audio autoencoders create compact latent representations that preserve
perceptually important information, serving as the foundation for both modern
audio compression systems and generation approaches like next-token prediction
and latent diffusion. Despite their prevalence, most audio processing
operations, such as spatial and spectral up-sampling, still inefficiently
operate on raw waveforms or spectral representations rather than directly on
these compressed representations. We propose a framework that performs audio
processing operations entirely within an autoencoder's latent space,
eliminating the need to decode to raw audio formats. Our approach dramatically
simplifies training by operating solely in the latent domain, with a latent L1
reconstruction term, augmented by a single latent adversarial discriminator.
This contrasts sharply with raw-audio methods that typically require complex
combinations of multi-scale losses and discriminators. Through experiments in
bandwidth extension and mono-to-stereo up-mixing, we demonstrate computational
efficiency gains of up to 100x while maintaining quality comparable to
post-processing on raw audio. This work establishes a more efficient paradigm
for audio processing pipelines that already incorporate autoencoders, enabling
significantly faster and more resource-efficient workflows across various audio
tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通用方法，用于加速Transducer模型中的束搜索，实现了两种优化算法ALSD++和AES++，显著提升了推理速度和识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transducer模型在端到端ASR系统中表现出色，但其束搜索模式因重复计算关键网络组件而导致推理速度大幅下降，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过批处理操作、基于树的假设结构、新颖的空白评分技术以及CUDA图执行，优化了束搜索过程，实现了高效的GPU推理。

Result: 该方法将束搜索与贪婪解码的速度差距缩小至10-20%，词错误率相对提升14-30%，并在低资源场景下将浅融合性能提升11%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法显著提升了Transducer模型的束搜索效率，同时保持了高识别准确率，所有算法均已开源。

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR
systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming
capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search
significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network
components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal
method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation
of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes
batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for
enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference.
This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the
whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy
decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to
existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决从复杂ambisonic录音中准确提取目标声场的挑战，特别是在存在空间邻近干扰源的情况下。

Method: 采用ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out架构，结合空间信息（如目标方向）和语义嵌入（如图像分割和字幕生成）。

Result: SoundSculpt在合成和真实ambisonic混合数据上表现优异，空间与语义信息结合在干扰源邻近时效果显著。

Conclusion: 空间和语义信息的结合能有效提升目标声场提取性能，尤其在复杂声学环境中。

Abstract: This paper introduces SoundSculpt, a neural network designed to extract
target sound fields from ambisonic recordings. SoundSculpt employs an
ambisonic-in-ambisonic-out architecture and is conditioned on both spatial
information (e.g., target direction obtained by pointing at an immersive video)
and semantic embeddings (e.g., derived from image segmentation and captioning).
Trained and evaluated on synthetic and real ambisonic mixtures, SoundSculpt
demonstrates superior performance compared to various signal processing
baselines. Our results further reveal that while spatial conditioning alone can
be effective, the combination of spatial and semantic information is beneficial
in scenarios where there are secondary sound sources spatially close to the
target. Additionally, we compare two different semantic embeddings derived from
a text description of the target sound using text encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强制对齐工具通常只提供单一的边界估计，缺乏对边界不确定性的量化。

Method: 使用10个不同的分段分类神经网络进行集成对齐，以中位数确定边界，并通过顺序统计构建97.85%置信区间。

Result: 在Buckeye和TIMIT语料库上，集成边界比单一模型略有改进，置信区间可输出为Praat格式或表格供分析。

Conclusion: 该方法有效量化了对齐边界的不确定性，为语音研究提供了更可靠的诊断工具。

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and
phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single
estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving
confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble
technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously
trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment
ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in
the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order
statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a
slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are
incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output
as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to
incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

Motivation: 探索自监督表示的结构，并开发一种简单高效的语音转换方法。

Method: 使用线性变换自监督特征进行语音转换，并通过奇异值分解显式分解内容和说话者信息。

Result: 仅旋转特征即可实现高质量语音转换，且低秩线性投影（秩为100）也能取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: LinearVC不仅为语音转换提供了实用方法，还深化了对自监督语音表示的理解。

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on
the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple
linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices.
Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of
allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient
for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is
embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to
produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a
method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using
singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of
just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for
both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised
speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EnCLAP方法使用EnCodec的离散标记作为输入，但EnCodec设计用于波形重建而非捕捉音频语义，因此需要改进。

Method: CLAP-ART通过向量量化从预训练的音频表示中计算语义丰富的离散标记，作为BART语言模型的输入。

Result: 实验证明，CLAP-ART在两个AAC基准测试中优于基线EnCLAP。

Conclusion: 语义丰富的离散标记对自动音频描述任务有益，CLAP-ART方法有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) aims to describe the semantic contexts of
general sounds, including acoustic events and scenes, by leveraging effective
acoustic features. To enhance performance, an AAC method, EnCLAP, employed
discrete tokens from EnCodec as an effective input for fine-tuning a language
model BART. However, EnCodec is designed to reconstruct waveforms rather than
capture the semantic contexts of general sounds, which AAC should describe. To
address this issue, we propose CLAP-ART, an AAC method that utilizes
``semantic-rich and discrete'' tokens as input. CLAP-ART computes semantic-rich
discrete tokens from pre-trained audio representations through vector
quantization. We experimentally confirmed that CLAP-ART outperforms baseline
EnCLAP on two AAC benchmarks, indicating that semantic-rich discrete tokens
derived from semantically rich AR are beneficial for AAC.

Method: 扩展了Rhythm and Voice（RnV）转换框架，引入了适合构音障碍语音的音节节奏建模方法，并评估了其对ASR性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，LF-MMI模型在转换后的语音上显著降低了词错误率，尤其在严重构音障碍情况下效果明显，而Whisper模型在转换数据上的微调效果有限。

Conclusion: 无监督的节奏和语音转换在构音障碍ASR中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with dysarthric speech
due to high inter-speaker variability and slow speaking rates. To address this,
we explore dysarthric-to-healthy speech conversion for improved ASR
performance. Our approach extends the Rhythm and Voice (RnV) conversion
framework by introducing a syllable-based rhythm modeling method suited for
dysarthric speech. We assess its impact on ASR by training LF-MMI models and
fine-tuning Whisper on converted speech. Experiments on the Torgo corpus reveal
that LF-MMI achieves significant word error rate reductions, especially for
more severe cases of dysarthria, while fine-tuning Whisper on converted data
has minimal effect on its performance. These results highlight the potential of
unsupervised rhythm and voice conversion for dysarthric ASR. Code available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种优化离散语音单元（DSUs）的方法，通过减少注意力窗口和模型大小，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了较高的语音识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于DSU的方法需要完整的语音输入和计算成本高的自监督语音模型（S3Ms），这在资源受限的环境中不实用。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来实现实时语音处理。

Method: 通过减少注意力窗口和模型大小，同时保留DSUs的有效性，从而降低计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，在ML-SUPERB 1h数据集上，浮点运算（FLOPs）减少了50%，而字符错误率（CER）仅相对增加了6.5%。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了DSUs在资源受限环境中进行实时语音处理的潜力。

Abstract: Discrete speech units (DSUs) are derived from clustering the features of
self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). DSUs offer significant advantages for
on-device streaming speech applications due to their rich phonetic information,
high transmission efficiency, and seamless integration with large language
models. However, conventional DSU-based approaches are impractical as they
require full-length speech input and computationally expensive S3Ms. In this
work, we reduce both the attention window and the model size while preserving
the effectiveness of DSUs. Our results demonstrate that we can reduce
floating-point operations (FLOPs) by 50% with only a relative increase of 6.5%
in character error rate (CER) on the ML-SUPERB 1h dataset. These findings
highlight the potential of DSUs for real-time speech processing in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于非线性Youla-Kučera参数化和鲁棒神经网络的稳定非线性策略参数化方法，确保闭环稳定性，并研究了在非线性动态、部分观测和增量稳定性要求下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决学习型控制中非线性策略的稳定参数化问题，特别是在非线性动态、部分观测和增量稳定性要求等复杂条件下的控制稳定性。

Method: 方法结合了非线性Youla-Kučera参数化和鲁棒神经网络（如循环平衡网络），通过一阶优化方法进行无约束搜索，确保闭环稳定性。

Result: 研究发现，在非线性动态、部分观测和增量稳定性要求中的任意两个条件下，收缩性和Lipschitz性质的Youla参数能保证闭环稳定性。但在三者同时存在时，增量稳定性可能受外部干扰影响，转而维持较弱的d-管收缩性和Lipschitz性质。

Conclusion: 结论表明，所提出的参数化方法在非线性系统控制学习中具有实用性，能够为经济奖励、短训练周期和不确定系统提供内置稳定性保证。

Abstract: We study parameterizations of stabilizing nonlinear policies for
learning-based control. We propose a structure based on a nonlinear version of
the Youla-Ku\v{c}era parameterization combined with robust neural networks such
as the recurrent equilibrium network (REN). The resulting parameterizations are
unconstrained, and hence can be searched over with first-order optimization
methods, while always ensuring closed-loop stability by construction. We study
the combination of (a) nonlinear dynamics, (b) partial observation, and (c)
incremental closed-loop stability requirements (contraction and Lipschitzness).
We find that with any two of these three difficulties, a contracting and
Lipschitz Youla parameter always leads to contracting and Lipschitz closed
loops. However, if all three hold, then incremental stability can be lost with
exogenous disturbances. Instead, a weaker condition is maintained, which we
call d-tube contraction and Lipschitzness. We further obtain converse results
showing that the proposed parameterization covers all contracting and Lipschitz
closed loops for certain classes of nonlinear systems. Numerical experiments
illustrate the utility of our parameterization when learning controllers with
built-in stability certificates for: i) ``economic'' rewards without
stabilizing effects; ii) short training horizons; and iii) uncertain systems.

Method: 提出一种非对称软DDT构建方法，仅在必要时扩展节点，避免传统方法中必须构建完整对称树的问题，从而更高效地利用决策节点。

Result: 非对称DDT在家庭能源管理系统中展现出透明、高效且高性能的决策潜力，同时提升了可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: 非对称软DDT方法通过自适应构建决策树，有效平衡了可解释性与性能需求，为家庭能源管理系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have gained
traction in home energy management systems. However, their adoption by energy
management companies remains limited due to the black-box nature of DRL, which
fails to provide transparent decision-making feedback. To address this,
explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) techniques have emerged, aiming to
make DRL decisions more transparent. Among these, soft differential decision
tree (DDT) distillation provides a promising approach due to the clear decision
rules they are based on, which can be efficiently computed. However, achieving
high performance often requires deep, and completely full, trees, which reduces
interpretability. To overcome this, we propose a novel asymmetric soft DDT
construction method. Unlike traditional soft DDTs, our approach adaptively
constructs trees by expanding nodes only when necessary. This improves the
efficient use of decision nodes, which require a predetermined depth to
construct full symmetric trees, enhancing both interpretability and
performance. We demonstrate the potential of asymmetric DDTs to provide
transparent, efficient, and high-performing decision-making in home energy
management systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合数据同化和强化学习的框架DA-MIRL，用于从部分和噪声观测中实时估计并控制时空混沌系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制时空混沌系统具有挑战性，因为其高维性和不可预测性。实践中，传感器通常只能提供部分且有噪声的系统观测。本文旨在开发一种框架，能够在部分和噪声观测下控制混沌系统。

Method: DA-MIRL方法整合了低阶模型近似高维动态、序列数据同化校正模型预测，以及基于校正状态估计的离策略演员-评论家强化学习算法。

Result: 在Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程的时空混沌解上测试表明，DA-MIRL能够从部分观测和近似模型中成功估计并抑制环境的混沌动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为部分可观测混沌系统的控制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high
dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically
requiring observations of the full physical state.In practice, sensors often
provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The
objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of
chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method,
data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates
(i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential
data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become
available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively
learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We
test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment
with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a
data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is
proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and
suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial
observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the
control of partially observable chaotic systems.

TL;DR: 论文指出，使用AI进行年龄验证存在易被规避和对少数群体及低收入用户分类不公的问题，建议避免采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨政府允许企业使用AI进行年龄验证可能带来的问题，特别是系统易被规避和对特定群体的不公平分类。

Method: 通过分析类似系统（如面部识别和远程监考软件）的偏见问题，预测AI年龄验证系统的潜在缺陷。

Result: AI模型及其硬件的技术限制导致偏见问题难以克服，成本上也不如基于政府ID的年龄验证。

Conclusion: 近期部署AI年龄验证系统是不明智的，应避免采用。

Abstract: In the near future a governmental body will be asked to allow companies to
use AI for age verification. If they allow it the resulting system will both be
easily circumvented and disproportionately misclassify minorities and low
socioeconomic status users. This is predictable by showing that other very
similar systems (facial recognition and remote proctoring software) have
similar issues despite years of efforts to mitigate their biases. These biases
are due to technical limitations both of the AI models themselves and the
physical hardware they are running on that will be difficult to overcome below
the cost of government ID-based age verification. Thus in, the near future,
deploying an AI system for age verification is folly.

Motivation: 随着自动化产品开发的推进，依赖非人类代理带来的风险增加，需要讨论这些风险及缓解策略。

Method: 通过风险分析，提出了一套更安全的AI驱动产品开发原则，涵盖技术和社会技术风险。

Result: 论文提出了一系列原则，旨在平衡AI驱动产品开发的机遇与风险，促进理解、规范制定和监管。

Conclusion: 早期讨论AI驱动产品开发的风险有助于在不延误必要进展的情况下平衡机会与风险。

Abstract: Humanity is progressing towards automated product development, a trend that
promises faster creation of better products and thus the acceleration of
technological progress. However, increasing reliance on non-human agents for
this process introduces many risks. This perspective aims to initiate a
discussion on these risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. To this end,
we outline a set of principles for safer AI-driven product development which
emphasize human oversight, accountability, and explainable design, among
others. The risk assessment covers both technical risks which affect product
quality and safety, and sociotechnical risks which affect society. While
AI-driven product development is still in its early stages, this discussion
will help balance its opportunities and risks without delaying essential
progress in understanding, norm-setting, and regulation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的兴起，提示工程师这一新职位逐渐受到关注，但其所需技能和市场普及度尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析LinkedIn上的20,662个职位发布（含72个提示工程师岗位），研究其技能需求。

Result: 提示工程师岗位占比不足0.5%，需具备AI知识（22.8%）、提示设计（18.7%）、沟通能力（21.9%）和创造性解决问题（15.8%）等独特技能组合。

Conclusion: 提示工程师正发展为一个独立职业，研究结果有助于求职者、雇主和教育机构理解这一新兴领域。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the
Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not
fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these
jobs are. We analyzed 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt
engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We found that
prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but
has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt
design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving
(15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of
established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers,
showing that prompt engineering is becoming its own profession. Our findings
help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better
understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索本地部署的开源大语言模型在临床心血管磁共振报告自动诊断分类中的可行性和效果。

Method: 评估了9个开源大语言模型对109份临床心血管磁共振报告的分类能力，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标量化性能。

Result: 多数开源模型表现卓越，Google的Gemma2模型以平均F1分数0.98领先，前四名模型在所有评估指标上均超过心脏病专家（F1分数0.94）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，开源隐私保护大语言模型可用于临床影像报告的自动分析，实现准确、快速且资源高效的诊断分类。

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving,
locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their
ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac
diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR
reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion
matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most
open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports
into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the
highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B
with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models
attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the
only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified
cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR
reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing
open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated
analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient
diagnostic categorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示工程技术对大型语言模型在医疗领域应用中准确性和置信度的影响，以确保高风险的医疗决策可靠性。

Method: 使用波斯医学考试题目数据集，评估五种LLM在156种配置下的表现，包括不同温度设置、提示风格和置信度标尺，采用AUC-ROC、Brier Score和ECE等指标。

Result: Chain-of-Thought提示提高准确性但引发过度自信；情感提示进一步放大置信度风险；小模型表现较差，专有模型准确性高但置信度校准不足。

Conclusion: 提示工程需同时优化准确性和不确定性校准，以适用于高风险的医疗任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both
accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to
medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions
across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini,
Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These
configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles
(Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales
(1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance.
Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence,
highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated
confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b
underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher
accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt
engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in
high-stakes medical tasks.

Motivation: 评估开源大语言模型在学术专家推荐任务中的性能，揭示其潜在偏见和局限性，以促进更可靠和公平的推荐系统发展。

Method: 使用美国物理学会和OpenAlex的真实数据作为基准，比较6个LLM在5项专家推荐任务中的输出结果，分析一致性、事实性和偏见。

Result: 所有模型均存在不一致和偏见，mixtral-8x7b最稳定，llama3.1-70b波动最大。模型普遍存在重复推荐、格式错误，并偏向资深学者、男性、白人和高引用学者。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在学术推荐中存在显著偏见和不一致性，需改进模型以减少偏见、提高准确性，实现更公平可靠的学术推荐。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b,
llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending
experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential
scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The
evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender,
ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data
from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly
benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our
analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b
produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest
variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b
and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real
scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific
queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist,
replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance),
under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars.
Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models
favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher
effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings
highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly
recommendations.

Motivation: 电视网络在制定节目决策时面临高财务风险，通常依赖有限的历史数据来预测收视率。

Method: 研究引入了机器学习框架，整合了来自25000多集电视节目的NLP特征（如情感基调、认知复杂性和叙事结构）与传统收视率数据，使用SARIMAX、滚动XGBoost和特征选择模型进行评估。

Result: 虽然历史收视率仍是强基线预测因子，但NLP特征对某些剧集的预测有显著改进。研究还提出了一种基于对话向量欧氏距离的相似性评分方法，用于比较节目内容。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同类型节目中表现出色，为编剧、高管和营销人员提供了可解释的指标，帮助他们基于数据洞察观众行为。

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming
decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic
viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates
natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes
with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting
emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode
dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost,
and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline
predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We
also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between
aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse
genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals
genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers,
executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在高风险决策（如稀缺资源分配）中与人类道德价值观的对齐问题。

Method: 系统评估多个主流LLM在肾脏分配场景中的行为，并与人类偏好对比；采用低秩监督微调方法。

Result: LLMs在属性优先级上明显偏离人类价值观，且极少表达不确定性；少量样本微调可有效改善决策一致性和不确定性建模。

Conclusion: 在道德/伦理领域，LLMs需要明确的价值观对齐策略。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes
decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs --
raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We
systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human
preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark
deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in
contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic
decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are
provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few
samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and
calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of
explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI治理框架多为高层原则，未能充分反映实际使用场景中的治理关切。研究旨在通过用户视角填补这一空白。

Method: 使用BERTopic模型分析G2.com平台的用户评论数据，提取语义相关的治理主题。

Result: 识别出技术与非技术领域的治理主题，包括隐私透明等常见议题，以及项目管理、战略制定等被忽视的实践维度。

Conclusion: 需结合实证的用户中心方法补充现有规范框架，推动更具包容性和操作性的AI治理。

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks
and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert
communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such
frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the
practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and
operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up
approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user
discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we
apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically
related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of
governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains.
These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning,
coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain,
including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings
show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics
frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked
areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer
interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded,
user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative
models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By
foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to
more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and
digital policy.

Motivation: 随着专有大语言模型（LLM）功能的增强，用户对其过度依赖和滥用（如作业代写、敏感文件处理）已成为社会问题。

Method: 提出TRAPDOC框架，通过向文档注入幻影标记，诱导LLM生成表面合理但实际错误的输出。

Result: 实证评估表明，TRAPDOC能有效欺骗过度依赖LLM的用户，效果优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRAPDOC为促进更负责任地使用语言模型奠定了基础，代码已开源。

Abstract: The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of
proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users
with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility
has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In
particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or
the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement.
This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social
issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting
imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate
outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this
technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant
LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several
baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible
and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper explores the emotional, ethical and practical dimensions of
integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into personal and professional
workflows, focusing on the concept of feeling guilty as a 'c(ai)borg' - a human
augmented by AI. Inspired by Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, the study
explores how AI challenges traditional notions of creativity, originality and
intellectual labour. Using an autoethnographic approach, the authors reflect on
their year-long experiences with AI tools, revealing a transition from initial
guilt and reluctance to empowerment through skill-building and transparency.
Key findings highlight the importance of basic academic skills, advanced AI
literacy and honest engagement with AI results. The c(ai)borg vision advocates
for a future where AI is openly embraced as a collaborative partner, fostering
innovation and equity while addressing issues of access and agency. By
reframing guilt as growth, the paper calls for a thoughtful and inclusive
approach to AI integration.

Motivation: 肝胆胰疾病的高发病率和死亡率使其成为全球公共卫生挑战，但目前缺乏针对该领域的大语言模型评估基准。

Method: 系统构建了包含3,535道选择题和337个真实诊断病例的评估基准，覆盖ICD-10中所有33个主要类别和465个子类别。

Result: 商业大语言模型在医学考试题上表现良好，但在复杂住院病例诊断任务中表现显著下降，医学专用模型对肝胆胰疾病的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在肝胆胰疾病领域存在关键局限，未来需要开发能处理真实复杂临床诊断的模型，而非仅能应对简单医学考题。

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health
challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical
question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived
from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB
coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically
eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended
multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which
encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases
defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public
datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from
prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating
hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on
our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial
LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial
performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex,
inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability
to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in
the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical
LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical
exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Motivation: 儿童在语音技术中代表性不足且隐私保护脆弱，但针对该群体的语音匿名化技术研究较少。本研究旨在填补这一空白，评估成人语音匿名化技术对儿童语音的适用性。

Method: 研究使用三个儿童语音数据集、六种匿名化方法，并通过主客观指标进行评估。

Result: 结果显示，现有成人匿名化系统能保护儿童语音隐私，但会导致更高的语音质量下降；主观实验揭示了自动评估方法在儿童语音质量评估中的不足。

Conclusion: 研究表明需进一步研究儿童语音匿名化技术，尤其是改进质量评估方法。

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies,
as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this,
anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little
attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline
for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when
applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's
speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults.
This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and
objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that
existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy,
but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective
study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech
quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash在三个地理空间任务中的表现，发现两者均存在误差，Gemini表现略优但仍有不足，结论指出大语言模型需地理信息微调以提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，其提供地理信息的准确性受到质疑，研究旨在评估模型在地理空间任务中的可信度。

Method: 研究通过地理编码、高程估计和反向地理编码三个任务，对比GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0 Flash的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在地理编码中偏差更大，Gemini更精确但有系统性偏移；两者均低估高程但能捕捉地形趋势；反向地理编码中Gemini整体更准确。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能近似地理信息，但准确性和可靠性不足，需地理信息微调以提升在地理信息科学中的应用价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their
trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly
important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent
the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to
consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical
world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini
2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and
reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and
random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck,
Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash
demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation
estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria,
though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash
performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved
identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0
Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating
better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model
achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting
persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can
approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are
inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical
information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics.

TL;DR: 该研究首次大规模分析了YouTube上与阿片类药物使用障碍(OUD)相关的健康谣言，开发了高效标注工具MythTriage，发现平台内容中谣言普遍存在，为公共卫生干预提供了依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线健康谣言影响公共健康，但针对阿片类药物使用障碍(OUD)这类高风险却研究不足的主题，缺乏大规模测量方法。YouTube作为主流健康信息平台，其OUD相关内容中的谣言尚未被系统研究。

Method: 1) 与临床专家合作验证8种常见OUD谣言并构建标注数据集 2) 提出MythTriage混合标注流程：轻量模型处理常规案例，复杂案例交由高成本大语言模型(LLM)处理

Result: 1) 分析2900条搜索结果和34.3万条推荐内容 2) MythTriage达到0.86宏F1值，预计降低76%标注成本 3) 揭示了YouTube上OUD谣言的传播模式

Conclusion: 该研究为平台内容审核和公共卫生干预提供了可行方案，证明混合标注方法在谣言检测中的高效性，揭示了视频平台健康谣言治理的紧迫性。

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can
inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such
misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but
understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in
the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on
YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts,
we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To
scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses
a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a
high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves
up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and
financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We
analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths
persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and
platform moderation.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用广泛反思平衡方法（MWRE）来增强大语言模型（LLM）的对齐技术，以提升其动态可修订性、程序合法性和伦理基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在社会中的广泛应用，确保其有益、安全且符合人类价值观变得至关重要。当前的对齐技术（如宪法AI）存在复杂迭代过程，需要更有效的伦理框架来指导。

Method: 采用广泛反思平衡方法（MWRE），通过协调道德判断、指导原则和背景理论，为LLM对齐提供动态、双向修订的框架。

Result: MWRE能够显著提升对齐技术的动态可修订性和程序合法性，从而产生更稳健且伦理上可辩护的结果。

Conclusion: MWRE作为一种启发式方法，不仅有助于批判性分析当前对齐技术，还能指导未来开发更符合伦理的AI系统。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across
society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human
values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI),
involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide
Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral
methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM
alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these
processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic
revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together,
these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible
outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered
moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories,
arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a
more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or
simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a
structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on
dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy
derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g.,
consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE
serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment
efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and
justifiably aligned AI systems.

Motivation: 当前电信领域微调LLMs时普遍忽视安全性问题，研究表明即使是良性微调也可能导致模型对有害查询做出响应。本文旨在诊断该问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用GenAINet的三个代表性电信数据集评估安全性退化问题，测试三种安全重对齐防御方法(SafeInstruct/SafeLoRA/SafeMERGE)，并扩展分析持续预训练的公开电信LLMs。

Conclusion: 本文是电信LLMs安全重对齐的诊断研究和实践指南，强调在现实部署中需要安全意识的指令调优和微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a
common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However,
little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety.
Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety
alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user
queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using
three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that
safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets
such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific
data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our
analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training,
revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the
omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both
fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and
evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and
SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that,
across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after
harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading
to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as
a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned
LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning
for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Motivation: 大学工程入门课程教师面临识别学生难点和满足多样化需求的挑战，需要一种既能量化技能难度又能评估学生能力的统计方法。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯模型，利用本科生静力学课程的大规模学生答题数据进行建模分析。

Result: 研究发现某些概念普遍较难，需要针对性教学支持；同时识别出不同学习轨迹的学生群体，为个性化教学提供依据。

Conclusion: 分层贝叶斯方法为教育工作者提供了直观可靠的指标，有助于制定数据驱动的个性化教学策略，提高学生参与度和成功率。

Abstract: Educators teaching entry-level university engineering modules face the
challenge of identifying which topics students find most difficult and how to
support diverse student needs effectively. This study demonstrates a rigorous
yet interpretable statistical approach -- hierarchical Bayesian modeling --
that leverages detailed student response data to quantify both skill difficulty
and individual student abilities. Using a large-scale dataset from an
undergraduate Statics course, we identified clear patterns of skill mastery and
uncovered distinct student subgroups based on their learning trajectories. Our
analysis reveals that certain concepts consistently present challenges,
requiring targeted instructional support, while others are readily mastered and
may benefit from enrichment activities. Importantly, the hierarchical Bayesian
method provides educators with intuitive, reliable metrics without sacrificing
predictive accuracy. This approach allows for data-informed decisions, enabling
personalized teaching strategies to improve student engagement and success. By
combining robust statistical methods with clear interpretability, this study
equips educators with actionable insights to better support diverse learner
populations.

Motivation: 现代奴役法案要求企业披露反奴役措施，但声明语言复杂且数量庞大，人工核查困难；且缺乏标注数据及跨司法管辖区工具泛化性研究。

Method: 1) 与领域专家合作标注英国和加拿大数据集；2) 提出三层分解的AIMSCheck端到端合规验证框架。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动的合规监测提供了可解释框架和跨辖区基准，有望促进反现代奴役实践的透明化。

Abstract: Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to
combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices
for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging
due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements
that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is
also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern
slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the
generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To
address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key
contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets
from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we
introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation.
AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels,
enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show
that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and
Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in
compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the
public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further
research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球AI监管对系统安全性的关注增加，‘可争议性’成为一项强制但定义模糊的保障措施。当前可解释AI领域缺乏对‘可争议性’的明确定义和实现方法，从业者难以满足监管要求。

Method: 基于系统性文献综述，论文提出了首个严格的可争议性形式化定义，并开发了一个模块化框架，涵盖人机交互界面、技术架构、法律流程和组织工作流。

Result: 通过多领域案例研究，论文揭示了现有系统的不足，并展示了框架如何推动针对性改进。提出的‘可争议性评估量表’包含20多项定量标准。

Conclusion: 该研究将‘可争议性’从监管理论转化为实用框架，为从业者提供了在AI系统中嵌入真实追责和问责机制的工具。

Abstract: As AI regulations around the world intensify their focus on system safety,
contestability has become a mandatory, yet ill-defined, safeguard. In XAI,
"contestability" remains an empty promise: no formal definition exists, no
algorithm guarantees it, and practitioners lack concrete guidance to satisfy
regulatory requirements. Grounded in a systematic literature review, this paper
presents the first rigorous formal definition of contestability in explainable
AI, directly aligned with stakeholder requirements and regulatory mandates. We
introduce a modular framework of by-design and post-hoc mechanisms spanning
human-centered interfaces, technical architectures, legal processes, and
organizational workflows. To operationalize our framework, we propose the
Contestability Assessment Scale, a composite metric built on more than twenty
quantitative criteria. Through multiple case studies across diverse application
domains, we reveal where state-of-the-art systems fall short and show how our
framework drives targeted improvements. By converting contestability from
regulatory theory into a practical framework, our work equips practitioners
with the tools to embed genuine recourse and accountability into AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了STPA方法在提升前沿AI系统安全性方面的潜力，通过系统性分析识别传统方法可能遗漏的风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI公司虽发布了安全框架，但缺乏详细的结构化风险分析方法。STPA作为一种系统性的安全分析方法，有望弥补这一不足。

Method: 应用STPA方法分析AI控制安全案例中的威胁模型和场景，识别不安全控制行为并探讨未缓解时的损失场景。

Result: STPA能够识别非结构化风险分析方法可能遗漏的因果因素，从而提升安全分析的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STPA可作为现有AI治理技术的补充，提升前沿AI的安全性，并通过减少对人类专家的依赖支持分析的可扩展性。

Abstract: All of the frontier AI companies have published safety frameworks where they
define capability thresholds and risk mitigations that determine how they will
safely develop and deploy their models. Adoption of systematic approaches to
risk modelling, based on established practices used in safety-critical
industries, has been recommended, however frontier AI companies currently do
not describe in detail any structured approach to identifying and analysing
hazards. STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis) is a systematic methodology
for identifying how complex systems can become unsafe, leading to hazards. It
achieves this by mapping out controllers and controlled processes then
analysing their interactions and feedback loops to understand how harmful
outcomes could occur (Leveson & Thomas, 2018). We evaluate STPA's ability to
broaden the scope, improve traceability and strengthen the robustness of safety
assurance for frontier AI systems. Applying STPA to the threat model and
scenario described in 'A Sketch of an AI Control Safety Case' (Korbak et al.,
2025), we derive a list of Unsafe Control Actions. From these we select a
subset and explore the Loss Scenarios that lead to them if left unmitigated. We
find that STPA is able to identify causal factors that may be missed by
unstructured hazard analysis methodologies thereby improving robustness. We
suggest STPA could increase the safety assurance of frontier AI when used to
complement or check coverage of existing AI governance techniques including
capability thresholds, model evaluations and emergency procedures. The
application of a systematic methodology supports scalability by increasing the
proportion of the analysis that could be conducted by LLMs, reducing the burden
on human domain experts.

Motivation: 随着欧盟AI法案的实施，企业开始调整行为以减轻监管负担。本文旨在探讨企业如何通过“avoision”策略在合法与非法之间游走。

Method: 通过构建框架和分类法，将“avoision”策略分为三个层级，分别对应法案的不同监管强度，并分析其组织和表现形式。

Result: 提出了一个对抗性框架，用于“红队测试”AI法案及未来AI监管的可能漏洞。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解企业如何应对AI监管提供了新视角，并有助于未来监管政策的完善。

Abstract: The shape of AI regulation is beginning to emerge, most prominently through
the EU AI Act (the "AIA"). By 2027, the AIA will be in full effect, and firms
are starting to adjust their behavior in light of this new law. In this paper,
we present a framework and taxonomy for reasoning about "avoision" -- conduct
that walks the line between legal avoidance and evasion -- that firms might
engage in so as to minimize the regulatory burden the AIA poses. We organize
these avoision strategies around three "tiers" of increasing AIA exposure that
regulated entities face depending on: whether their activities are (1) within
scope of the AIA, (2) exempted from provisions of the AIA, or are (3) placed in
a category with higher regulatory scrutiny. In each of these tiers and for each
strategy, we specify the organizational and technological forms through which
avoision may manifest. Our goal is to provide an adversarial framework for "red
teaming" the AIA and AI regulation on the horizon.

*Shivam Shorewala,Zihao Yang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: MOVDA框架通过真实与预期比分差的差异分析，提升传统评分系统，显著优于ELO和贝叶斯基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ELO等评分系统仅关注二元结果，忽略了比分差等关键信息，MOVDA旨在更有效地整合这些数据。

Method: MOVDA通过非线性函数（缩放双曲正切）预测预期比分差，利用真实与预期差异作为评分更新信号。

Result: 在NBA数据上，MOVDA降低预测误差1.54%，提升准确率0.58%，加速收敛13.5%，保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MOVDA为竞争环境（如NBA）提供了理论合理、实证优越且计算高效的技能评分方法。

Abstract: Knowledge of accurate relative skills in any competitive system is essential,
but foundational approaches such as ELO discard extremely relevant performance
data by concentrating exclusively on binary outcomes. While margin of victory
(MOV) extensions exist, they often lack a definitive method for incorporating
this information. We introduce Margin of Victory Differential Analysis (MOVDA),
a framework that enhances traditional rating systems by using the deviation
between the true MOV and a $\textit{modeled expectation}$. MOVDA learns a
domain-specific, non-linear function (a scaled hyperbolic tangent that captures
saturation effects and home advantage) to predict expected MOV based on rating
differentials. Crucially, the $\textit{difference}$ between the true and
expected MOV provides a subtle and weighted signal for rating updates,
highlighting informative deviations in all levels of contests. Extensive
experiments on professional NBA basketball data (from 2013 to 2023, with 13,619
games) show that MOVDA significantly outperforms standard ELO and Bayesian
baselines. MOVDA reduces Brier score prediction error by $1.54\%$ compared to
TrueSkill, increases outcome accuracy by $0.58\%$, and most importantly
accelerates rating convergence by $13.5\%$, while maintaining the computational
efficiency of the original ELO updates. MOVDA offers a theoretically motivated,
empirically superior, and computationally lean approach to integrating
performance magnitude into skill rating for competitive environments like the
NBA.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解无监督学习中广泛使用的图拉普拉斯算子如何有效估计流形上椭圆微分算子的特征对，并探索其统计最优性。

Method: 通过分析流形上分布的二阶导数约束和几何有界性，采用极小极大风险框架评估特征对估计问题，并研究随机数据构建的图拉普拉斯算子的逼近速率。

Result: 证明了在H^1(M)意义下特征值和特征向量的统计极小极大速率为n^{-2/(d+4)}，该速率与相关密度估计问题的最优速率一致，并在更强正则性假设下验证了图拉普拉斯算子的最优性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅扩展了基于图的学习理论，提出了更强的误差度量范数，还证明了收敛速率在光滑分布族上的普适性，且当图连通性足够高时这些速率本质上是尖锐的。

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating eigenpairs of elliptic differential
operators from samples of a distribution $\rho$ supported on a manifold $M$.
The operators discussed in the paper are relevant in unsupervised learning and
in particular are obtained by taking suitable scaling limits of widely used
graph Laplacians over data clouds. We study the minimax risk for this eigenpair
estimation problem and explore the rates of approximation that can be achieved
by commonly used graph Laplacians built from random data. More concretely,
assuming that $\rho$ belongs to a certain family of distributions with
controlled second derivatives, and assuming that the $d$-dimensional manifold
$M$ where $\rho$ is supported has bounded geometry, we prove that the
statistical minimax rate for approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the
$H^1(M)$-sense is $n^{-2/(d+4)}$, a rate that matches the minimax rate for a
closely related density estimation problem. We then revisit the literature
studying Laplacians over proximity graphs in the large data limit and prove
that, under slightly stronger regularity assumptions on the data generating
model, eigenpairs of graph Laplacians induce manifold agnostic estimators with
an error of approximation that, up to logarithmic corrections, matches our
lower bounds. Our analysis allows us to expand the existing literature on
graph-based learning in at least two significant ways: 1) we consider stronger
norms to measure the error of approximation than the ones that had been
analyzed in the past; 2) our rates of convergence are uniform over a family of
smooth distributions and do not just apply to densities with special
symmetries, and, as a consequence of our lower bounds, are essentially sharp
when the connectivity of the graph is sufficiently high.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的视角，通过建立与模型无关的泛化误差上界，解释了大规模机器学习模型成功的原因，并指出数据量相对于Rényi熵的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解大规模机器学习模型的泛化误差行为，传统分析往往将误差界限与模型复杂度联系起来，但无法完全解释极大规模架构的成功。

Method: 论文引入了一种新的方法，通过建立适用于仅由数据直方图决定输出的算法的泛化误差上界，该上界仅依赖于数据生成分布的Rényi熵。

Result: 结果表明，只要数据量相对于Rényi熵足够大，即使模型规模任意增大，仍能保持较小的泛化误差。此外，论文还展示了数据分布依赖性，证明了Rényi熵对应的数据量对成功学习至关重要。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是，泛化误差的上界与数据生成分布的Rényi熵密切相关，数据量的充足性是维持良好泛化性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Will further scaling up of machine learning models continue to bring success?
A significant challenge in answering this question lies in understanding
generalization error, which is the impact of overfitting. Understanding
generalization error behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning
models remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses
often link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the
success of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel
perspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization
error applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the
data's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based
methods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\'enyi entropy
of the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization
error can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data
quantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct
explanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades
significantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance
degrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's
R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, we adapt the no-free-lunch theorem to be
data-distribution-dependent, demonstrating that an amount of data corresponding
to the R\'enyi entropy is indeed essential for successful learning, thereby
highlighting the tightness of our proposed generalization bound.

Motivation: 传统PCA假设数据位于欧几里得空间，无法直接应用于黎曼流形数据。Fletcher等人提出的PGA方法虽适用于某些结构化数据（如医学图像），但对缺乏局部距离概念的通用数据集效果有限。

Method: 通过为数据表配备局部度量，将PCA方法扩展到黎曼流形，从而结合流形几何特性，提出R-PCA框架。

Result: R-PCA提供了一个统一的降维和统计分析方法，适用于具有区域或部分特定距离概念的数据集，并保持其内在几何特性。

Conclusion: R-PCA为黎曼流形上的数据分析提供了新思路，扩展了PCA的适用范围，尤其适用于具有复杂几何结构的数据集。

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative extension of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) that transcends the traditional assumption of data lying in Euclidean
space, enabling its application to data on Riemannian manifolds. The primary
challenge addressed is the lack of vector space operations on such manifolds.
Fletcher et al., in their work {\em Principal Geodesic Analysis for the Study
of Nonlinear Statistics of Shape}, proposed Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA)
as a geometric approach to analyze data on Riemannian manifolds, particularly
effective for structured datasets like medical images, where the manifold's
intrinsic structure is apparent. However, PGA's applicability is limited when
dealing with general datasets that lack an implicit local distance notion. In
this work, we introduce a generalized framework, termed {\em Riemannian
Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA)}, to extend PGA for any data endowed with
a local distance structure. Specifically, we adapt the PCA methodology to
Riemannian manifolds by equipping data tables with local metrics, enabling the
incorporation of manifold geometry. This framework provides a unified approach
for dimensionality reduction and statistical analysis directly on manifolds,
opening new possibilities for datasets with region-specific or part-specific
distance notions, ensuring respect for their intrinsic geometric properties.

Abstract: Varying coefficient models are popular for estimating nonlinear regression
functions in functional data models. Their Bayesian variants have received
limited attention in large data applications, primarily due to prohibitively
slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
We introduce Bayesian data sketching for varying coefficient models to obviate
computational challenges presented by large sample sizes. To address the
challenges of analyzing large data, we compress the functional response vector
and predictor matrix by a random linear transformation to achieve dimension
reduction and conduct inference on the compressed data. Our approach
distinguishes itself from several existing methods for analyzing large
functional data in that it requires neither the development of new models or
algorithms, nor any specialized computational hardware while delivering fully
model-based Bayesian inference. Well-established methods and algorithms for
varying coefficient regression models can be applied to the compressed data.

### [703] [Label-shift robust federated feature screening for high-dimensional classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00379)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种标签偏移鲁棒的联邦特征筛选方法（LR-FFS），通过条件分布函数和期望处理标签偏移问题，保持计算效率并保护隐私。

Motivation: 分布式和联邦学习在高维数据分类中很重要，但数据异质性（尤其是标签偏移）给特征筛选带来挑战。

Method: 提出LR-FFS框架，利用条件分布函数和期望处理标签偏移，无需增加计算负担，且对模型误设和异常值鲁棒。

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are important tools for high-dimensional
classification of large datasets. To reduce computational costs and overcome
the curse of dimensionality, feature screening plays a pivotal role in
eliminating irrelevant features during data preprocessing. However, data
heterogeneity, particularly label shifting across different clients, presents
significant challenges for feature screening. This paper introduces a general
framework that unifies existing screening methods and proposes a novel utility,
label-shift robust federated feature screening (LR-FFS), along with its
federated estimation procedure. The framework facilitates a uniform analysis of
methods and systematically characterizes their behaviors under label shift
conditions. Building upon this framework, LR-FFS leverages conditional
distribution functions and expectations to address label shift without adding
computational burdens and remains robust against model misspecification and
outliers. Additionally, the federated procedure ensures computational
efficiency and privacy protection while maintaining screening effectiveness
comparable to centralized processing. We also provide a false discovery rate
(FDR) control method for federated feature screening. Experimental results and
theoretical analyses demonstrate LR-FFS's superior performance across diverse
client environments, including those with varying class distributions, sample
sizes, and missing categorical data.

*Tatsuki Takahashi,Chihiro Maru,Hiroko Shoji*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文针对大规模排名动作空间中的离策略评估问题，提出了两种新假设和GMIPS估计器，有效降低了方差，并在实验中展示了最低的MSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在推荐系统中，评估新策略时仅能使用历史记录数据，而现有估计器在高维排名动作空间中存在高方差问题，因此需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出了两种新假设（排名无直接影响和用户行为模型在排名嵌入空间），并设计了广义边际化逆倾向得分（GMIPS）估计器，特别是MRIPS变体通过双重边际化权重平衡偏差与方差。

Result: 实验证明GMIPS实现了最低的MSE，且MRIPS在排名动作空间增大时仍能有效平衡偏差与方差的权衡。

Conclusion: GMIPS及其变体MRIPS在大规模排名动作空间的离策略评估中表现出色，尤其在假设不完全成立时仍保持稳健性能。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) in ranking settings with large ranking action
spaces, which stems from an increase in both the number of unique actions and
length of the ranking, is essential for assessing new recommender policies
using only logged bandit data from previous versions. To address the high
variance issues associated with existing estimators, we introduce two new
assumptions: no direct effect on rankings and user behavior model on ranking
embedding spaces. We then propose the generalized marginalized inverse
propensity score (GMIPS) estimator with statistically desirable properties
compared to existing ones. Finally, we demonstrate that the GMIPS achieves the
lowest MSE. Notably, among GMIPS variants, the marginalized reward interaction
IPS (MRIPS) incorporates a doubly marginalized importance weight based on a
cascade behavior assumption on ranking embeddings. MRIPS effectively balances
the trade-off between bias and variance, even as the ranking action spaces
increase and the above assumptions may not hold, as evidenced by our
experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种适用于缺失数据的分数匹配变体方法：重要性加权法和变分法，分别在小样本低维和高维复杂场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数匹配在数据分布学习中有广泛应用，但现有研究很少探讨其在数据缺失情况下的应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种分数匹配变体：重要性加权（IW）方法和变分方法，适用于数据在任意坐标子集上部分缺失的灵活场景。

Result: IW方法在有限域小样本低维情况下表现强劲；变分方法在高维复杂任务（如图模型估计）中效果更优，并在真实和模拟数据上得到验证。

Conclusion: 两种方法互补，扩展了分数匹配在缺失数据场景下的适用性，为不同维度和样本量问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Score matching is a vital tool for learning the distribution of data with
applications across many areas including diffusion processes, energy based
modelling, and graphical model estimation. Despite all these applications,
little work explores its use when data is incomplete. We address this by
adapting score matching (and its major extensions) to work with missing data in
a flexible setting where data can be partially missing over any subset of the
coordinates. We provide two separate score matching variations for general use,
an importance weighting (IW) approach, and a variational approach. We provide
finite sample bounds for our IW approach in finite domain settings and show it
to have especially strong performance in small sample lower dimensional cases.
Complementing this, we show our variational approach to be strongest in more
complex high-dimensional settings which we demonstrate on graphical model
estimation tasks on both real and simulated data.

Conclusion: GLMDP框架突破了线性MDP的限制，适用于非线性奖励场景，所提算法在数据稀缺时表现优异。

Abstract: The linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework offers a principled
foundation for reinforcement learning (RL) with strong theoretical guarantees
and sample efficiency. However, its restrictive assumption-that both transition
dynamics and reward functions are linear in the same feature space-limits its
applicability in real-world domains, where rewards often exhibit nonlinear or
discrete structures. Motivated by applications such as healthcare and
e-commerce, where data is scarce and reward signals can be binary or
count-valued, we propose the Generalized Linear MDP (GLMDP) framework-an
extension of the linear MDP framework-that models rewards using generalized
linear models (GLMs) while maintaining linear transition dynamics. We establish
the Bellman completeness of GLMDPs with respect to a new function class that
accommodates nonlinear rewards and develop two offline RL algorithms:
Generalized Pessimistic Value Iteration (GPEVI) and a semi-supervised variant
(SS-GPEVI) that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled trajectories. Our
algorithms achieve theoretical guarantees on policy suboptimality and
demonstrate improved sample efficiency in settings where reward labels are
expensive or limited.

Conclusion: 基于PP的密度比估计方法有效解决了高维数据下的偏差和维度灾难问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a paramount task in machine learning, for
its broad applications across multiple domains, such as covariate shift
adaptation, causal inference, independence tests and beyond. Parametric methods
for estimating the density ratio possibly lead to biased results if models are
misspecified, while conventional non-parametric methods suffer from the curse
of dimensionality when the dimension of data is large. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for DRE based on the
projection pursuit (PP) approximation. The proposed method leverages PP to
mitigate the impact of high dimensionality while retaining the model
flexibility needed for the accuracy of DRE. We establish the consistency and
the convergence rate for the proposed estimator. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing alternatives in
various applications.

Abstract: Integral equations are widely used in fields such as applied modeling,
medical imaging, and system identification, providing a powerful framework for
solving deterministic problems. While parameter identification for differential
equations has been extensively studied, the focus on integral equations,
particularly stochastic Volterra integral equations, remains limited. This
research addresses the parameter identification problem, also known as the
equation reconstruction problem, in Volterra integral equations driven by
Gaussian noise. We propose an improved deep neural networks framework for
estimating unknown parameters in the drift term of these equations. The network
represents the primary variables and their integrals, enhancing parameter
estimation accuracy by incorporating inter-output relationships into the loss
function. Additionally, the framework extends beyond parameter identification
to predict the system's behavior outside the integration interval. Prediction
accuracy is validated by comparing predicted and true trajectories using a 95%
confidence interval. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed deep neural networks framework in both parameter identification and
prediction tasks, showing robust performance under varying noise levels and
providing accurate solutions for modeling stochastic systems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度对角线性神经网络在过参数化线性回归中的隐式正则化效应，分析了梯度流轨迹极限点与ℓ1最小化解之间的近似误差，并揭示了不同网络深度下的误差衰减特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型常在参数数量超过训练样本数的过参数化场景下训练。为理解梯度下降在此类模型中的隐式偏差，前人研究了回归任务中对角线性神经网络的ℓ1最小化倾向。本文旨在深入分析不同网络深度下近似误差与初始化规模的关系。

Method: 通过理论推导深度D≥2的对角线性神经网络梯度流轨迹，建立近似误差与初始化规模α的严格上下界，并设计数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 发现深度D≥3时误差随α线性下降，而D=2时以α^(1-ϱ)速率下降（ϱ∈[0,1)与稀疏恢复中的零空间性质常数相关）。实验表明更深网络（D≥3）在现实初始化规模下可能具有更好泛化性。

Conclusion: 网络深度对隐式正则化效果具有本质影响，深度≥3的网络在合理初始化下能更逼近ℓ1最小化解，这为过参数化模型的优化设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are often trained in a setting where the
number of parameters exceeds the number of training samples. To understand the
implicit bias of gradient descent in such overparameterized models, prior work
has studied diagonal linear neural networks in the regression setting. These
studies have shown that, when initialized with small weights, gradient descent
tends to favor solutions with minimal $\ell^1$-norm - an effect known as
implicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate implicit regularization
in diagonal linear neural networks of depth $D\ge 2$ for overparameterized
linear regression problems. We focus on analyzing the approximation error
between the limit point of gradient flow trajectories and the solution to the
$\ell^1$-minimization problem. By deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the
approximation error, we precisely characterize how the approximation error
depends on the scale of initialization $\alpha$. Our results reveal a
qualitative difference between depths: for $D \ge 3$, the error decreases
linearly with $\alpha$, whereas for $D=2$, it decreases at rate
$\alpha^{1-\varrho}$, where the parameter $\varrho \in [0,1)$ can be explicitly
characterized. Interestingly, this parameter is closely linked to so-called
null space property constants studied in the sparse recovery literature. We
demonstrate the asymptotic tightness of our bounds through explicit examples.
Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and suggest that
deeper networks, i.e., $D \ge 3$, may lead to better generalization,
particularly for realistic initialization scales.

Motivation: 尽管机器学习模型在各领域取得显著进展，但其对输入数据的微小扰动（对抗性攻击）表现脆弱。现有方法在稳健损失的统计最优性方面存在未解之谜，特别是在未来X攻击下的极小极大收敛速率和最优估计器构建问题。

Conclusion: 该研究从理论上量化了对抗性学习的统计极限，提出的估计器为对抗环境下非参数回归提供了最优统计保证，填补了对抗学习基础理论空白。

Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements of machine learning models and algorithms in
various application domains, they are known to be vulnerable to subtle, natural
or intentionally crafted perturbations in future input data, known as
adversarial attacks. While numerous adversarial learning methods have been
proposed, fundamental questions about their statistical optimality in robust
loss remain largely unanswered. In particular, the minimax rate of convergence
and the construction of rate-optimal estimators under future $X$-attacks are
yet to be worked out.
  In this paper, we address this issue in the context of nonparametric
regression, under suitable assumptions on the smoothness of the regression
function and the geometric structure of the input perturbation set. We first
establish the minimax rate of convergence under adversarial $L_q$-risks with $1
\leq q \leq \infty$ and propose a piecewise local polynomial estimator that
achieves the minimax optimality. The established minimax rate elucidates how
the smoothness level and perturbation magnitude affect the fundamental limit of
adversarial learning under future $X$-attacks. Furthermore, we construct a
data-driven adaptive estimator that is shown to achieve, within a logarithmic
factor, the optimal rate across a broad scale of nonparametric and adversarial
classes.

Conclusion: 本文方法在理论和实践上均有优势，但上下界之间存在固有差距，揭示了该聚类问题的独特结构。

Abstract: We study the problem of clustering $T$ trajectories of length $H$, each
generated by one of $K$ unknown ergodic Markov chains over a finite state space
of size $S$. The goal is to accurately group trajectories according to their
underlying generative model. We begin by deriving an instance-dependent,
high-probability lower bound on the clustering error rate, governed by the
weighted KL divergence between the transition kernels of the chains. We then
present a novel two-stage clustering algorithm. In Stage~I, we apply spectral
clustering using a new injective Euclidean embedding for ergodic Markov chains
-- a contribution of independent interest that enables sharp concentration
results. Stage~II refines the initial clusters via a single step of
likelihood-based reassignment. Our method achieves a near-optimal clustering
error with high probability, under the conditions $H =
\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} (S^2 \vee \pi_{\min}^{-1}))$ and $TH =
\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}^{-1} S^2 )$, where $\pi_{\min}$ is the
minimum stationary probability of a state across the $K$ chains and
$\gamma_{\mathrm{ps}}$ is the minimum pseudo-spectral gap. These requirements
provide significant improvements, if not at least comparable, to the
state-of-the-art guarantee (Kausik et al., 2023), and moreover, our algorithm
offers a key practical advantage: unlike existing approach, it requires no
prior knowledge of model-specific quantities (e.g., separation between kernels
or visitation probabilities). We conclude by discussing the inherent gap
between our upper and lower bounds, providing insights into the unique
structure of this clustering problem.

Abstract: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is a widely used concept in machine learning
research which has gained popularity in recent years as a highly effective tool
for comparing (finite-dimensional) distributions. Since it is designed as a
kernel-based method, the MMD can be extended to path space valued distributions
using the signature kernel. The resulting signature MMD (sig-MMD) can be used
to define a metric between distributions on path space. Similarly to the
original use case of the MMD as a test statistic within a two-sample testing
framework, the sig-MMD can be applied to determine if two sets of paths are
drawn from the same stochastic process. This work is dedicated to understanding
the possibilities and challenges associated with applying the sig-MMD as a
statistical tool in practice. We introduce and explain the sig-MMD, and provide
easily accessible and verifiable examples for its practical use. We present
examples that can lead to Type 2 errors in the hypothesis test, falsely
indicating that samples have been drawn from the same underlying process (which
generally occurs in a limited data setting). We then present techniques to
mitigate the occurrence of this type of error.

under the specified likelihood. The resulting algorithms are theoretically
grounded and can be integrated seamlessly with neural networks for learning the
target trajectory ensembles, without access to data.

Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite
dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space,
building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and
extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances
whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for
merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all
asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for
constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation,
thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics
(Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods,
Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on
recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem lies at the core of many
applications in combinatorial optimization, software verification,
cryptography, and machine learning. While state-of-the-art solvers have
demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF)
formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as
XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages
polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies
on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers.
In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations
for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into
when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that
unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid
benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous
optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT
solving.

Result: 参与者欣赏聊天机器人的匿名性和无评判性，但也担忧隐私安全。测试显示聊天机器人存在回应不一致、不适当及缺乏危机敏感性问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果可为技术和心理健康行业提供参考，以优化AI聊天机器人在情感支持中的应用。

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks
professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have
increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or
simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who
have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language
model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily
utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion.
Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots.
However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive
information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional
issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to
add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help.
However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional
inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis
sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating
responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and
mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support
individuals during challenging emotional periods.

TL;DR: 提出Ctrl-Crash模型，通过条件信号生成可控车祸视频，解决现有方法因数据稀缺导致的真实感不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散技术因驾驶数据集中事故样本稀缺，难以生成真实车祸场景。提升交通安全需可控且逼真的事故模拟。

Method: 基于边界框、碰撞类型和初始帧等条件信号，结合分类器无关引导技术，实现细粒度控制的车祸视频生成。

Result: 在FVD/JEDi等量化指标和人工评估中，模型在物理真实感和视频质量上均超越现有扩散方法。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Crash通过多条件控制生成高真实感车祸视频，为交通安全研究提供有效的反事实场景模拟工具。

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years;
however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the
scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety
requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the
problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model
that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial
image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where
minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To
support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free
guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal.
Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video
quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a
human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior
diffusion-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为感知流形引导（PMG）的算法，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和感知质量特征，在无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管潜在扩散模型在高维图像数据生成和各种下游任务中取得了进展，但在无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）任务中，对这些模型的感知一致性研究较少。论文假设潜在扩散模型在数据流形中隐式表现出感知一致的局部区域，并利用这一假设进行感知特征引导的采样。

Method: 论文提出了感知流形引导（PMG）算法，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型和感知质量特征，从去噪U-Net中提取感知一致的多尺度和多时间步特征图。

Result: 实验表明，这些超特征在IQA任务中与人类感知高度相关。该方法可以应用于任何现有的预训练潜在扩散模型，并且易于集成。在IQA数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法（LGDM）实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文首次提出了利用感知特征引导扩散模型进行NR-IQA的方法，展示了扩散模型在NR-IQA任务中的卓越泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate
high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has
been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the
task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we
hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually
consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to
guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.
Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that
utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to
obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from
the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures
exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be
applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is
straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA.
Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization
capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

*JungWoo Chae,Jiyoon Kim,Sangheum Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种并行重缩放技术，用于个性化扩散模型，通过分解一致性引导信号，改善提示对齐和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DreamBooth和Textual Inversion在少量参考图像下容易过拟合，导致生成图像与文本提示不一致。Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO)虽部分缓解此问题，但仍难以处理复杂或风格化提示。

Method: 提出并行重缩放技术，将一致性引导信号分解为与分类器自由引导(CFG)平行和正交的分量，通过重缩放平行分量减少对CFG的干扰，同时保留主体身份。

Result: 实验表明，相比基线方法，该方法在提示对齐和视觉保真度上均有提升，尤其在挑战性风格化提示上表现更优。

Conclusion: 并行重缩放引导技术能更稳定、准确地实现个性化，适用于多样化用户输入。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains
challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available.
Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to
limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts
when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While
Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling
partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized
prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for
personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the
consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to
classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we
minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's
identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require
additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show
improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods,
even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of
parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization
for diverse user inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合潜在扩散模型和3D对比视觉语言预训练的新架构，用于从文本生成高质量的3D CT图像，显著优于现有基线，并能有效增强下游诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本条件的生成模型在2D医学图像（如胸部X光）上取得进展，但扩展到3D CT图像仍面临高维度、解剖结构复杂及缺乏3D医学影像与语言对齐框架等挑战。

Method: 采用双编码器CLIP风格模型在CT体积和放射学报告对上训练，建立共享嵌入空间作为生成条件输入，并通过预训练的体积VAE将CT压缩到低维潜在空间，实现高效3D去噪扩散。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上评估显示，该方法在图像保真度、临床相关性和语义对齐方面表现优异，生成的CT扫描能有效增强真实数据，提升下游诊断性能。

Conclusion: 特定模态的视觉语言对齐是高质量3D医学图像生成的关键，结合对比预训练和体积扩散的方法为从文本合成具有临床意义的CT体积提供了可扩展且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have
enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely
confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image
generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant
challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the
absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical
imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation
that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language
pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model
trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared
embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT
volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained
volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring
external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the
CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,
clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive
performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for
text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by
our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream
diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific
vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image
generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion,
our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing
clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications
in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过遮蔽自编码（MAE）训练的视觉Transformer（ViT）表现出与格式塔法则一致的行为，如轮廓补全和图形-背景分离。自监督模型在全局空间关系测试中优于监督模型，甚至有时超过人类表现。分类微调会削弱这种能力，但通过Top-K激活稀疏机制可恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代视觉模型是否像人类视觉一样，能够根据格式塔原则（如闭合、邻近、图形-背景分配）将局部线索组织成连贯的全局形式，并研究这些行为在何种训练条件下出现。

Method: 使用遮蔽自编码（MAE）训练视觉Transformer（ViT）和ConvNeXt模型，并通过新提出的扭曲空间关系测试平台（DiSRT）评估模型对全局空间扰动的敏感性。

Result: MAE训练的ViT表现出格式塔式的激活模式，自监督模型在DiSRT测试中优于监督基线，甚至有时超过人类。分类微调会降低这种能力，但Top-K激活稀疏机制可恢复全局敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究确定了促进或抑制格式塔式感知的训练条件，并证明DiSRT可作为评估模型对全局结构敏感性的诊断工具。

Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt
principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions
reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision
models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge.
We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE)
exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory
contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground
segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling
global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce
the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates
sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures.
Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform
supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt
models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations,
suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However,
classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision,
we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global
sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress
Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global
structure sensitivity across models.

TL;DR: ArtiScene提出了一种无需训练的自动化3D场景设计流程，通过2D图像作为中介指导3D合成，显著提升了布局和美学质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D场景设计既需要艺术专长又依赖复杂软件，而现有文本到3D生成方法受限于高质量3D数据的稀缺性。本文利用成熟的文本到图像模型生成多样化2D布局，作为3D合成的桥梁。

Method: 首先生成描述对应的2D图像，从中提取物体形状和外观创建3D模型，最后根据图像几何信息组装成完整场景。整个过程无需额外训练。

Result: 量化指标显示该方法在布局和美学质量上大幅领先现有技术，用户研究胜率达74.89%，GPT-4o评估胜率95.07%。

Conclusion: 通过2D中介实现3D合成的策略有效突破了数据限制，为场景设计提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both
artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in
text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users
create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods
generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is
often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In
contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can
generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually
appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D
scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D
synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated
pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form
text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary
layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape
and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into
the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the
same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and
styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in
layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89%
winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答(VQA)模型只能从预定义答案列表中选择，无法处理开放性问题。微调新答案耗时且不灵活，需要零样本学习方案。

Method: 利用大规模预训练视觉语言模型(VLM)，提出零样本视觉问答方法ZeShot-VQA，直接处理未见过的答案类型。

Result: 方法在FloodNet灾后数据集上验证有效，能生成训练时未见的答案，展现零样本学习优势。

Conclusion: ZeShot-VQA无需微调即可适应新场景，解决了传统VQA模型在开放性问答中的局限性。

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures.
Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on
affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual
question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth
understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the
ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a
predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional
possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to
be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a
time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive
datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal
vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In
this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and
investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the
proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new
datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and
generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which
demonstrates its flexibility.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为L3A的方法，用于解决多标签类增量学习中的标签缺失和类别不平衡问题，无需存储历史样本，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签类增量学习（MLCIL）在实际场景中面临标签缺失和类别不平衡的挑战，导致模型对历史信息不完整且偏向多数类。

Method: L3A方法包含两个关键模块：伪标签模块（PL）通过生成伪标签解决标签缺失问题，加权分析分类器（WAC）通过样本特定权重平衡类别贡献。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上的实验表明，L3A在MLCIL任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: L3A通过标签增强和自适应类别平衡，有效解决了MLCIL中的关键问题，且无需存储历史样本。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes
continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL
(MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to
multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to
incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance,
which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these
challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an
exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key
modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by
generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label
absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form
solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to
adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance.
Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms
existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on
improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate
Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing
the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose
Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to
model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By
projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional
Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more
discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger
articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet
mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in
hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end
translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the
representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential
of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language
Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and
improving computational efficiency. Code available here:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要针对特定场景微调，计算资源消耗大，难以在边缘设备上实现。TrajICL旨在实现快速适应不同场景，无需微调。

Method: 结合时空相似性示例选择（STES）和预测引导示例选择（PG-ES），利用大规模合成数据集训练模型。

Result: TrajICL在多个公开基准测试中表现优异，优于微调方法，适应性强。

Conclusion: TrajICL通过上下文学习框架，有效解决了行人轨迹预测中的适应性问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for
autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for
adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves
collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via
backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due
to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce
TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory
prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the
scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example
selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed
trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at
corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce
prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on
both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than
relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to
account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of
relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train
our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability
by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain
scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public
benchmarks. The code will be released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UEM的框架，通过PGVS模块和CAER模块改进视频事件建模，实现了更精确的部分相关视频检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视频分割为固定数量的等长片段，导致事件边界模糊，且使用平均池化计算事件表示，容易引入不对齐问题。

Method: 提出UEM框架，包含PGVS模块（基于时间依赖和语义相似性迭代划分事件）和CAER模块（通过文本交叉注意力优化事件表示）。

Result: 在两个PRVR基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UEM框架通过改进事件建模和表示，显著提升了部分相关视频检索的准确性。

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to
retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling
is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that
partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos
into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event
boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event
representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address
these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first
introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to
iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and
semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event
boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement
(CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's
cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most
relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出HSCR方法，通过分层自对比奖励解决医学视觉语言模型中的模态不对齐问题，提升模型的可信度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）在临床环境中可能因模态不对齐问题产生不可信的回答，需要一种高效且能捕捉细微偏好的对齐方法。

Method: HSCR利用Med-VLMs生成低偏好响应，通过视觉标记丢弃分析模态耦合标记，并引入多级偏好优化策略，结合隐式偏好提升对齐精度。

Result: 实验表明，HSCR在多种医学任务（如Med-VQA、医学图像描述等）中显著提升了零样本性能、模态对齐和可信度，仅需2000条训练数据。

Conclusion: HSCR有效解决了Med-VLMs的模态不对齐问题，为临床环境提供了更可靠和精准的模型响应。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across
various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment
issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this
paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel
approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1)
Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced
and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the
inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher
sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token
dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and
derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token
replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality
dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference
optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level
optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative
quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise
and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical
tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following,
demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also
significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000
training entries.

Motivation: 人类对事件的感知依赖于区分已完成和进行中的动作，这一过程受语言结构和视觉线索的共同影响。论文旨在探究视频语言模型是否能真正理解时间动态，还是仅依赖表面标记。

Method: 通过构建一个包含英语、意大利语、俄语和日语的多选题问答数据集，结合日常活动视频和事件完成标签，以及专门设计的干扰项，来测试模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管现有模型在文本任务上表现良好，但在基于视频的时间和因果推理方面仍难以达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 研究强调了整合深度多模态线索以捕捉动作持续性和完成度细微差别的重要性，为评估和提升视频语言模型的时间推理能力设立了新标准。

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between
completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process
mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we
introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English,
Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark
designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By
pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and
perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly
comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers.
Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their
success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal
reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of
integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and
completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard
for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIGC检测方法多为黑盒二元分类器，缺乏解释性且不支持多模态统一检测，影响了模型透明度和实际部署。

Method: 构建大规模标注数据集IVY-FAKE，并提出统一视觉语言模型IVY-XDETECTOR，实现图像和视频的可解释检测。

Conclusion: IVY-FAKE和IVY-XDETECTOR为AIGC检测提供了统一且可解释的解决方案，显著推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in
visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos,
driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based
architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they
simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and
integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary
classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports
detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation
compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel,
unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable
multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from
fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over
150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700
evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning
beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable
Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture
that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content.
Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant
advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的评估主要忽视了对结构化视觉知识理解的能力，因此需要一个新的评估标准来填补这一空白。

Method: 作者设计了M3STR基准，利用多模态知识图谱生成包含多模态实体及其复杂关系的图像，要求模型识别实体并解析其关系拓扑。

Result: 对26个先进多模态大语言模型的评估显示，这些模型在处理结构化视觉知识时存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: M3STR基准揭示了多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉知识理解上的不足，为提升其整体推理能力指明了方向。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous
modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse
scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and
leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of
MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in
visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and
devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for
STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs
to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with
multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the
multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate
relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical
profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive
empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent
deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured
knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic
reasoning capacities. Our code and data are released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为商网络的新网络结构，通过改进ResNet的学习方式，解决了特征差异学习中的问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet虽然通过残差学习解决了深度网络的训练问题，但其学习特征差异的方式存在两个问题：差异缺乏独立明确的意义，且学习量基于绝对差异而非相对差异，对现有特征规模敏感。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出商网络，学习目标特征与现有特征的商而非差异，并设计了相应的网络训练规则，确保高效训练且不增加额外参数。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，商网络能稳定地比ResNet取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 商网络有效解决了ResNet的局限性，同时保留了其优势，通过简单的改进即可实现性能提升，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep
networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the
network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the
difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference
between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear
meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the
relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We
propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still
having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient
of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient
network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve
higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it
can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet.
Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network
can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny
corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new
parameters.

Motivation: 解决图像域语义混合与视频之间的差距，实现在视频中精确控制对象语义混合的同时保持时间连贯性。

Method: 利用对角线去噪计划和类无关分割检测跟踪对象，结合动量语义校正和伽马残差噪声稳定技术确保时序一致性。

Result: 在自建数据集上超越现有基线，空间一致性、运动连贯性和CASS分数显著更高，且无需训练或微调。

Conclusion: 扩散噪声轨迹的结构化操作可实现可控、高质量的视频合成。

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a
training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing
and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image,
MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific
object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual
context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and
class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and
precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure
temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and
gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate
MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS,
and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to
evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the
source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset,
MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial
consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite
having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured
manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable,
high-quality video synthesis.

Conclusion: 通过系统性推理激励和计算资源优化，可显著提升小规模模型处理复杂指令的能力，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex
instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in
paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely
chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of
LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on
performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the
instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for
identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To
this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex
instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First,
we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing
taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we
exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals
to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the
shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via
sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior
cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking
LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive
benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM
achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但它们仍易受视觉对抗攻击的影响，而现有的净化方法研究较少。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: F3框架采用“以火攻火”策略，通过向对抗样本注入噪声并利用跨模态注意力作为参考目标，从而净化对抗样本。

Result: F3在对抗净化方面表现出色，具有无需训练、易于实现和计算高效等优势，适用于大规模工业应用。

Conclusion: F3通过创新的噪声对抗策略，有效提升了模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持了高效性，为工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their
remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language
tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks,
which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential
impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial
examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce
F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive
"fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple
perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects.
Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly
perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into
these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting
in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly
paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks
yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct
advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing
purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for
large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and
operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出EvolveNav框架，通过两阶段训练提升基于LLM的视觉语言导航能力，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航(VLN)方法直接映射输入输出，导致决策难以解释且学习困难。Chain-of-Thought(CoT)训练能提升准确性和可解释性，但导航任务复杂性使完美CoT标签难以获取，纯监督微调易过拟合。

Method: EvolveNav包含两阶段：(1) 格式化CoT监督微调：用格式化CoT标签激活模型导航推理能力并加速推理；(2) 自反思后训练：用模型自身推理输出作为自增强CoT标签迭代训练，并引入自反思辅助任务对比错误推理模式。

Result: 在主流VLN基准测试中，EvolveNav优于之前基于LLM的VLN方法。

Conclusion: EvolveNav通过自演进推理框架有效提升了LLM在视觉语言导航任务中的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following
natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot
interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of
training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning
ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap
between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches
primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping
learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational
decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation
task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting
through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel
sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based
vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two
stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model
with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning
capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective
Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning
outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A
self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct
reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the
popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous
LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at

TL;DR: Latent Wavelet Diffusion (LWD) 是一种轻量级框架，无需修改架构或增加计算开销，即可实现超高清图像生成（2K至4K），通过提升潜在表示的光谱保真度和聚焦高频细节来优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像合成在生成模型中仍面临挑战，尤其是在计算效率与保留精细视觉细节之间的平衡。现有方法难以在不增加计算负担的情况下实现超高清图像生成。

Method: LWD 提出三个关键组件：1) 尺度一致的变分自编码器目标，增强潜在表示的光谱保真度；2) 小波能量图，定位潜在空间中细节丰富的区域；3) 时间依赖的掩码策略，在训练中聚焦高频成分的去噪监督。

Result: LWD 在超高清图像合成中显著提升感知质量并降低FID（Frechet Inception Distance），优于基线模型，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: LWD 展示了频率感知和信号驱动监督在高分辨率生成建模中的高效性与原则性，为轻量级超高清图像合成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative
modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the
preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion
(LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale
to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces
three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective
that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet
energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the
latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising
supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no
architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead.
Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces
FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for
high-resolution generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索指纹模式与血型之间的潜在关联，以评估血型数据是否能作为生物特征识别的补充工具，优化现有身份鉴定方法。

Method: 研究纳入200名受试者，对比其指纹类型（斗形、箕形、弓形）与血型，采用卡方检验和皮尔逊相关性分析统计关联性。

Result: 箕形纹最常见，O+血型占比最高；指纹模式与血型间无显著统计学差异，血型数据未能有效提升指纹识别精度。

Conclusion: 血型与指纹的弱相关性支持多模态生物特征系统的开发方向，建议未来结合更大样本、机器学习及其他生物特征以改进鉴定方法。

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and
healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more
accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This
study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO
blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were
included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and
blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops
were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most
prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no
statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different
blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not
significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with
fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the
efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current
biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples,
and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve
identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing
nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification,
highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal
identification.

Method: 提出GThinker模型，引入Cue-Rethinking机制，通过视觉线索迭代推理，并采用两阶段训练流程（模式引导冷启动和激励强化学习）。

Result: GThinker在M$^3$CoT基准测试中达到81.5%准确率，超越O4-mini模型，并在通用场景多模态推理任务中平均提升2.1%。

Conclusion: GThinker通过创新的推理模式和训练方法，显著提升了多模态推理能力，尤其在视觉相关任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal
reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their
predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies,
while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual
information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail
to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks
that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To
address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM
excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and
science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that
grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to
resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a
two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive
reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities
across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct
GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths
and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward
general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker
achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark
M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average
improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while
maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to
counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be
released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的指令调优需要大量高质量标注数据和计算资源，成本高昂。

Method: 通过相对误差驱动的样本选择策略，动态追踪模型学习进度，优先选择当前最有益的学习样本。

Result: 在多个不同规模的数据集上，PROGRESS以更少的数据和监督超越了现有最佳基线方法。

Conclusion: PROGRESS是一种可扩展的高效学习解决方案，具有跨架构泛化能力。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets,
high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized
cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data-
and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to
learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the
model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most
informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too
difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively
controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned.
Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress,
prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods,
PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need
basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does
not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments
across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that
PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less
data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture
generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a
scalable solution for efficient learning.

Motivation: 现有基于神经辐射场的水果计数方法存在推理速度慢、泛化能力有限且缺乏开放集语义控制的问题，难以满足实际农业环境的需求。

Method: 采用自适应高斯泼溅管道进行果园场景重建，结合CLIP对齐的语言嵌入实现语义控制，并通过分布感知采样和聚类进行水果计数。

Result: 实验表明，FruitLangGS在真实果园数据上实现了更高的渲染速度、语义灵活性和计数准确性。

Conclusion: FruitLangGS为开放世界场景下的语言驱动实时神经渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a
longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the
high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on
neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization,
and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents
FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these
limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and
language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs
orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with
radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To
enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned
language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At
inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D
space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The
selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via
distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts.
Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves
higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to
prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time
neural rendering across open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 扰动报告判别方法有效解决了生物医学领域语义复杂性带来的挑战，为视觉语言预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical
images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations.
These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the
biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train
vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions.
Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and
domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive
methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report
discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we
curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt
the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of
perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report
from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we
enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both
modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in
the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results
demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust
multi-modal representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双过程蒸馏方案，使前馈图像生成器能够从视觉语言模型（VLM）中学习新任务，通过文本和图像界面实现多种控制任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成控制方法在学习新任务方面能力有限，而视觉语言模型（VLM）能够通过上下文学习任务并生成正确输出。本文旨在利用VLM的能力，提升图像生成器的任务学习能力。

Method: 采用双过程蒸馏方案，利用VLM对生成的图像进行评分，并通过反向传播梯度更新图像生成器的权重，从而实现新任务的学习。

Result: 该方法能够快速实现多种多模态控制任务，如色彩调色板、线条粗细、地平线位置和相对深度等，用户可在几分钟内完成设置。

Conclusion: 通过双过程蒸馏方案，图像生成器能够高效地从VLM中学习新任务，扩展了图像生成的控制能力，为多模态控制提供了灵活且快速的解决方案。

Abstract: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability
to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn
tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose
a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to
learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the
generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the
image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control
tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of
applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as
commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement
multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon
position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CORTEX方法，通过识别概念特定token组合来解释VQGM模型，包含样本级和码书级两种解释方法，有效提升模型透明度并支持图像编辑等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQGM模型中的离散token码书尚未被充分理解，特别是哪些token对生成特定概念的图像至关重要。

Method: 提出CORTEX框架，包含：(1)样本级解释方法分析单张图像中token重要性，(2)码书级解释方法全局搜索相关token。

Result: 实验证明CORTEX能清晰解释生成过程中的token使用，在多种预训练VQGM上超越基线，并支持目标图像编辑等应用。

Conclusion: CORTEX不仅增强了VQGM的可解释性，其识别关键token的能力还能有效支持下游应用。

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of
discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are
critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces
Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting
VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs
two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token
importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation
method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens.
Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear
explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines
across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX
is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature
detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangTianze009/CORTEX.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数据集中缺乏上下文不一致的示例，限制了上下文学习的研究。COinCO数据集旨在填补这一空白，提供丰富的上下文变化场景。

Method: 使用扩散修复技术系统性地替换COCO图像中的对象，并通过多模态大语言模型验证和分类修复对象是否与上下文一致。

Result: COinCO数据集支持三种关键任务：上下文分类器训练、对象从上下文预测任务以及上下文增强的虚假检测，无需微调即可提升现有方法性能。

Conclusion: COinCO数据集为计算机视觉和图像取证中的上下文感知视觉理解提供了可控的测试平台，奠定了进一步研究的基础。

Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel
dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision
datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through
diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both
contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context
learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in-
or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our
analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence
inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks
enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine
whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel
Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects
naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3)
context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without
fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations,
establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in
computer vision and image forensics. Our code and data are at:

Motivation: 动物行为识别面临非刚性身体结构、频繁遮挡和缺乏大规模标注数据集等挑战，这些挑战与人类行为识别不同，需要专门的研究和方法来解决。

Method: 通过评估时空深度学习框架（如SlowFast）在动物行为分析中的有效性，并分析现有数据集的局限性，探讨了动物行为识别的技术和方法。

Conclusion: 未来研究应致力于提高动物行为识别的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在复杂自然环境中对不同物种的行为分析。

Abstract: This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action
recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques.
The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour
recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising
subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ
significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors
such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of
large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution
of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it
progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for
fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly
relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and
environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models
cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences
between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high
intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of
animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks
(e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour
analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the
strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a
recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing
fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and
generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.

significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents
ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges
through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite

satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine
spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a
Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and
spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while
preserving critical image details.

TL;DR: 提出TIME框架，结合TabPFN表格模型与视觉特征，解决表格-图像多模态学习中的标准化表示和缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格-图像多模态学习缺乏标准化预训练表格表示，且难以处理真实医疗数据中的缺失值。

Method: 使用冻结的TabPFN作为表格编码器生成抗缺失的嵌入，与预训练视觉特征结合，探索多种融合策略。

Result: 实验表明TIME在完整和不完整表格输入下均优于基线，验证了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: TIME为真实场景多模态学习提供了有效解决方案，尤其在医疗领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data
with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in
medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a
standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly
available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling
missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical
datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal
Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently
introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen
tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally
resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from
pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and
tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms
competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs,
underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VS2和VS2++方法，通过稀疏自编码器在推理时引导视觉模型，无需重新训练或大量标注数据，显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态或资源受限环境中，无需重新训练或大量标注数据即可引导视觉基础模型是一个重要但具有挑战性的目标。

Method: 提出VS2方法，利用稀疏自编码器学习稀疏特征生成引导向量；进一步提出VS2++，通过检索增强选择性放大相关稀疏特征；还提出PASS方法，通过原型对齐损失优化稀疏特征。

Result: VS2在多个数据集上超越零样本CLIP，VS2++在特定条件下提升更显著，PASS在CIFAR-100上比VS2提升6.12%。

Conclusion: 稀疏引导方法能有效提升视觉模型性能，尤其在特定类别上表现突出，且无需大量标注数据。

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or
access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective,
particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we
introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that
guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features
learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.
Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on
CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a
retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features
using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative
sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44%
on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2
and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing
that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or
taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost.
Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE
reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose
Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a
prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training
while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though
modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100
with ViT-B/32.

*Hosu Lee,Junho Kim,Hyunjun Kim,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ReFoCUS框架，通过强化学习优化视频帧选择策略，提升多模态模型在视频问答中的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法依赖静态启发式或外部检索模块选择帧，可能无法提供与查询相关的信息，限制了视频内容的理解能力。

Method: 采用强化学习训练帧选择策略，利用参考模型的奖励信号指导选择，并通过自回归条件选择架构降低组合复杂性。

Result: 在多个视频问答基准测试中，该方法无需显式帧级监督即可持续提升推理性能。

Conclusion: ReFoCUS通过将帧选择与模型内部效用对齐，显著增强了视频内容理解能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective
vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains
constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often
rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame
information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant
information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame
Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy
optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual
responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy
via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM
to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support
temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial
frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture
that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does
not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves
reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the
benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

Conclusion: Edge-IMI框架为建筑机械闲置监测提供了高效可行的边缘计算解决方案。

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing
equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational
costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity
is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency.
This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction
machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera
systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection,
tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on
resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of
Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS
benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an
F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The
logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes
between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all
three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance
on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also
evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an
Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the
feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频模型在交互式视频内容和流媒体应用中具有优势，但实时视频生成仍面临计算成本高和硬件效率低的问题。本文旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 1. 将一致性蒸馏扩展到视频领域并适配视频模型，实现少步采样高效推理；2. 提出推测性采样，利用相邻帧动作输入相同的观察，并行生成多帧并在动作输入不同时丢弃推测帧。

Result: 在大规模动作条件视频生成基准测试中，NFD在视觉质量和采样效率上均优于自回归基线模型，首次实现310M模型在A100 GPU上超过30 FPS的自回归视频生成。

Conclusion: NFD通过创新技术显著提升了自回归视频生成的效率和实时性，为交互式和流媒体应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional
diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming
applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame
Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates
block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient
inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless,
achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such
models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion
sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation.
To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency
distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models,
enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage
parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often
share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this
approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and
discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments
on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that
NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling
efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at
over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Result: 在四个PAR基准测试中取得竞争性性能，推理效率高。

Conclusion: ViTA-PAR通过多模态提示和对齐机制有效提升了行人属性识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various
detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and
gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from
coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained
local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse
regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the
model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to
attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded
performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In
this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute
Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance
attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and
vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture
global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To
enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person
and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context.
Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion.
ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance
with efficient inference. We release our code and model at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何数据（如曲线、图、曲面）的非欧几里得特性使统计分析面临挑战，需构建具有不变性的机器学习框架以确保模型泛化能力。

Method: 基于varifold表示形状作为测度，利用其与测试函数的对偶性，引入神经网络表示可训练测试函数，构建分类与回归模型。

Result: 方法在多种形状图与曲面数据集上表现优异，参数量显著减少，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: SVarM为形状空间提供了一种高效且通用的机器学习框架，兼具强性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning,
performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a
shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes
under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate
such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure
generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes
SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their
duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$.
This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines
but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We
develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a
neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This
approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape
graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image
diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based
paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention
mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable
Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between
original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a
coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic
correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and
superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of
leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and
encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving
discriminative tasks.

Conclusion: SCAD为高效、高保真的文本到图像生成提供了可行方案，平衡了成本与性能。

Abstract: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully
scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such
models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research
usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of
pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a
generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other
large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for
a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity
text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized
discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for
text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable
enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We
also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the
diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID
competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less
training cost.

TL;DR: EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30数据集通过多模态数据捕捉厨房环境中的人类行为，为行为理解提供新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类行为需要复杂任务下的数据集，厨房环境因其丰富的动作和认知活动成为理想选择。

Method: 使用9个RGB-D相机、IMU和HoloLens~2头显，采集16名受试者在厨房中的多模态数据，并进行密集标注。

Result: 构建了包含29.7小时数据的多模态数据集，并提出了四个行为理解和建模的基准任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集有望推动生态效度人类行为理解的方法和见解发展。

Abstract: Understanding behavior requires datasets that capture humans while carrying
out complex tasks. The kitchen is an excellent environment for assessing human
motor and cognitive function, as many complex actions are naturally exhibited
in kitchens from chopping to cleaning. Here, we introduce the
EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset, collected in a noninvasive motion capture
platform inside a kitchen environment. Nine static RGB-D cameras, inertial
measurement units (IMUs) and one head-mounted HoloLens~2 headset were used to
capture 3D hand, body, and eye movements. The EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset is
a multi-view action dataset with synchronized exocentric, egocentric, depth,
IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects
cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with
33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we
propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through
1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation
benchmark, 3) a multi-modal action recognition benchmark, 4) a pose-based
action segmentation benchmark. We expect the EPFL-Smart-Kitchen-30 dataset to
pave the way for better methods as well as insights to understand the nature of
ecologically-valid human behavior. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: MDW提出了一种多模态数据集蒸馏框架，通过优化蒸馏数据的信息密度和噪声容忍能力，显著提升模型训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型训练面临两大挑战：大规模数据集带来的存储和计算成本高昂，以及网络爬取数据中的噪声严重影响模型性能。

Method: MDW引入可学习的细粒度对应关系，通过双轨协作学习避免噪声干扰，并自适应优化蒸馏数据以提升信息密度。

Result: 实验表明，MDW在不同压缩比下均优于现有方法15%以上，展现出卓越的扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: MDW为多模态模型训练提供了一种高效、鲁棒的数据集蒸馏解决方案，适用于多样化的应用场景。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world
applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data
challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading
to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are
typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs,
severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal
dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill
noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient
model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained
correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to
emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled
data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust
cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes
dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating
information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments
validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability,
surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios,
highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy
and resource needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据修剪方法在样本信息量和冗余处理上存在不足，InfoMax旨在通过优化这两方面来提升核心集的质量和模型学习效率。

Method: 将核心集选择问题形式化为离散二次规划任务，结合重要性评分和样本相似度量化信息与冗余，采用梯度求解器和稀疏化技术实现高效计算。

Result: 实验表明，InfoMax在图像分类、视觉语言预训练和大语言模型指令调优等任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: InfoMax通过优化信息量与冗余的平衡，显著提升了数据修剪的效果，并具备处理大规模数据集的能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as
coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected
samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall
informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is
measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in
model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities,
based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning
process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic
programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information
content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the
redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure
practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver,
complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and
dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to
datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image
classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large
language models.

TL;DR: 通过分析不同输入模态（RGB视频和3D手部姿势）的采样频率对自我中心动作识别性能和CPU使用的影响，研究发现降低RGB帧采样率并结合高频3D手部姿势输入可在保持高精度的同时显著降低CPU需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴XR设备的普及，自我中心动作识别（EAR）系统为深入理解人类行为和情境感知提供了新视角。然而，由于便携性、电池寿命和计算资源之间的固有权衡，在这些设备上部署实时算法具有挑战性。

Method: 系统地分析了RGB视频和3D手部姿势两种输入模态在不同采样频率下对EAR性能和CPU使用的影响，探索了多种配置以全面表征精度与计算效率之间的权衡。

Result: 研究发现，在3D手部姿势输入保持高频的情况下，降低RGB帧的采样率可以显著减少CPU使用（高达3倍），同时几乎不影响识别性能。

Conclusion: 多模态输入策略是实现XR设备上高效实时自我中心动作识别的可行方法，通过优化采样频率配置可以在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算需求。

Abstract: The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for
Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human
understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms
on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between
portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we
systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input
modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition
performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a
comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate
of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can
preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we
observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in
recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input
strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR
devices.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为unMORE的新型两阶段无监督多对象分割方法，通过显式学习对象中心表示并在第二阶段进行多对象推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督多对象分割方法仅能分割简单的合成对象或发现有限的真实世界对象，无法处理复杂场景。

Method: unMORE采用两阶段流程：第一阶段学习三个层次的对象中心表示，第二阶段利用网络无关的多对象推理模块发现多个对象。

Result: 在6个真实世界基准数据集（包括COCO）上，unMORE显著优于所有现有无监督方法，尤其在拥挤图像中表现突出。

Conclusion: unMORE通过创新的两阶段设计和对象中心表示学习，实现了无监督多对象分割的突破性进展。

Abstract: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on
single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives
to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar
pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or
discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce
unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in
real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three
levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage.
Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object
priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this
reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all
existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including
the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation
results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines
collapse.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级MoDA模块，通过指令引导调制改进多模态大语言模型的视觉特征对齐，提升细粒度视觉概念理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确关联细粒度视觉概念，需要增强视觉特征的语义对齐能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 视觉特征与LLM输入空间对齐；2) 通过Transformer交叉注意力机制生成调制掩码，优化特征表达。

Result: 实验表明MoDA能提升视觉定位能力，生成更符合语境的响应。

Conclusion: MoDA作为通用增强模块，有效提升了基于图像的多模态大语言模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained
visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches
often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In
this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective
module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through
instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training
protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the
LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2)
refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning
stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a
modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing
semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction.
The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language
generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual
grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

Motivation: 非接触式指纹识别面临图像失焦、脊谷对比度低、手指位置偏差等问题，亟需提升匹配准确性与鲁棒性。

Method: 采用全局空间特征捕获与局部特征对齐的多阶段Transformer架构，构建分层特征提取与匹配流程。

Result: 在HKPolyU和RidgeBase数据集上，接触式/非接触式混合匹配场景中性能优于商业现成方案(COTS)。

Conclusion: 该方法通过层次化特征处理实现了细粒度对齐与全局鲁棒性的平衡，为非接触式指纹识别提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has
underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint
recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges,
including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint
ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective
distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of
contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel
multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that
first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized
feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical
feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained,
cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature
representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets
such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as
contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including
COTS solutions.

TL;DR: TaxaDiffusion提出了一种基于分类学的扩散模型训练框架，通过分层学习策略生成高保真度的细粒度动物图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将每个物种视为独立类别，忽略了物种间视觉相似性。TaxaDiffusion旨在利用分类学知识，通过分层训练提升生成图像的形态和身份准确性。

Method: TaxaDiffusion采用分层训练策略，从粗粒度分类（如纲、目）开始，逐步细化到科、属，最终区分物种级别，利用共享形态特征实现知识迁移。

Result: 在三个细粒度动物数据集上的实验表明，TaxaDiffusion在生成保真度上优于现有方法，尤其在物种样本有限时表现突出。

Conclusion: TaxaDiffusion通过整合分类学知识，显著提升了细粒度动物图像生成的准确性，为数据稀缺场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/

communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{MedEBench}, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It
consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks
across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a
clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual
Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of
expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison
of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a

attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid
foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful
medical image editing systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular solubility is a cornerstone of early-stage
drug discovery, yet conventional machine learning models face significant
challenges due to limited labeled data and the high-dimensional nature of
molecular descriptors. To address these issues, we propose LatMixSol, a novel
latent space augmentation framework that combines autoencoder-based feature
compression with guided interpolation to enrich training data. Our approach
first encodes molecular descriptors into a low-dimensional latent space using a
two-layer autoencoder. Spectral clustering is then applied to group chemically
similar molecules, enabling targeted MixUp-style interpolation within clusters.
Synthetic samples are generated by blending latent vectors of cluster members
and decoding them back to the original feature space. Evaluated on the
Huuskonen solubility benchmark, LatMixSol demonstrates consistent improvements
across three of four gradient-boosted regressors (CatBoost, LightGBM,
HistGradientBoosting), achieving RMSE reductions of 3.2-7.6% and R-squared
increases of 0.5-1.5%. Notably, HistGradientBoosting shows the most significant
enhancement with a 7.6% RMSE improvement. Our analysis confirms that
cluster-guided latent space augmentation preserves chemical validity while
expanding dataset diversity, offering a computationally efficient strategy to
enhance predictive models in resource-constrained drug discovery pipelines.

2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate
time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows
for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time
series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the
most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting
process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries.
Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in
forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries.
Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets
and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market
dynamics using MTGNN.

### [774] [The Disparate Effects of Partial Information in Bayesian Strategic Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00627)
*Srikanth Avasarala,Serena Wang,Juba Ziani*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究评分规则的部分信息如何影响战略学习中的公平性，分析不同代理模型（天真和贝叶斯）在噪声信号下的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在战略学习环境中，代理因不完全了解评分规则而采取策略性行为时，如何导致不同群体之间的结果差异，以及透明度如何影响这些差异。

Method: 采用两种代理模型（天真代理和贝叶斯代理），分析他们在噪声信号下的行为，并研究不同透明度水平对群体间差异的影响。

Result: 天真代理的效用差异可能随噪声无限增大，而贝叶斯代理的差异则有限；差异常在中透明度水平最小化。群体间成本和先验信念的不对称性进一步影响公平性。

Conclusion: 透明度水平对公平性有显著影响，中透明度可能是平衡群体间差异的最佳选择，贝叶斯代理能更有效地应对信息不完全的情况。

Abstract: We study how partial information about scoring rules affects fairness in
strategic learning settings. In strategic learning, a learner deploys a scoring
rule, and agents respond strategically by modifying their features -- at some
cost -- to improve their outcomes. However, in our work, agents do not observe
the scoring rule directly; instead, they receive a noisy signal of said rule.
We consider two different agent models: (i) naive agents, who take the noisy
signal at face value, and (ii) Bayesian agents, who update a prior belief based
on the signal.
  Our goal is to understand how disparities in outcomes arise between groups
that differ in their costs of feature modification, and how these disparities
vary with the level of transparency of the learner's rule. For naive agents, we
show that utility disparities can grow unboundedly with noise, and that the
group with lower costs can, perhaps counter-intuitively, be disproportionately
harmed under limited transparency. In contrast, for Bayesian agents,
disparities remain bounded. We provide a full characterization of disparities
across groups as a function of the level of transparency and show that they can
vary non-monotonically with noise; in particular, disparities are often
minimized at intermediate levels of transparency. Finally, we extend our
analysis to settings where groups differ not only in cost, but also in prior
beliefs, and study how this asymmetry influences fairness.

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析一万多场扑克锦标赛数据，验证了独立筹码模型（ICM）的表现，发现其高估短筹码玩家、低估大筹码玩家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管独立筹码模型（ICM）在现代扑克锦标赛策略中占据核心地位，但其在真实场景中的表现尚未得到充分验证，尤其是在大规模数据下的准确性。

Method: 作者收集了超过一万场扑克锦标赛的结果数据，并设计了两项实验：首先验证ICM比基线模型更准确，其次检验ICM对不同筹码量玩家表现的评估偏差。

Result: 实验证实ICM比基线模型更优，但也发现其系统性低估大筹码玩家表现，同时高估短筹码玩家表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进扑克锦标赛中玩家价值评估算法提供了实证基础，揭示了ICM模型的局限性。

Abstract: The independent chip model (ICM) forms a cornerstone of all modern poker
tournament strategy. However, despite its prominence, the ICM's performance in
the real world has not been sufficiently scrutinized, especially at a large
scale. In this paper, we introduce our new dataset of poker tournaments,
consisting of results of over ten thousand events. Then, using this dataset, we
perform two experiments as part of a large-scale empirical validation of the
ICM. First, we verify that the ICM performs more accurately than a baseline we
propose. Second, we obtain empirical evidence of the ICM underestimating the
performances of players with larger stacks while overestimating those who are
short-stacked. Our contributions may be useful to future researchers developing
new algorithms for estimating a player's value in poker tournaments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不完全信息博弈（如战争迷雾象棋）长期以来是AI领域的重大挑战，尤其在德州扑克AI取得超人类表现后，这类博弈成为新的研究焦点。

Method: 提出Obscuro系统，通过创新不完全信息博弈搜索算法实现可扩展的强推理能力，重点解决信息收集、对手知识推断和信号传递等问题。

Result: 实验表明Obscuro显著优于现有最佳AI和人类顶级选手，成为首个在最大规模不完全信息回合制游戏中实现超人类表现的AI。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了不完全信息搜索技术在大规模博弈中的应用边界，为AI在不完全信息环境中的推理能力设立了新标杆。

Abstract: Since the advent of AI, games have served as progress benchmarks. Meanwhile,
imperfect-information variants of chess have existed for over a century,
present extreme challenges, and have been the focus of significant AI research.
Beyond calculation needed in regular chess, they require reasoning about
information gathering, the opponent's knowledge, signaling, etc. The most
popular variant, Fog of War (FoW) chess (aka. dark chess) is a recognized
challenge problem in AI after superhuman performance was reached in no-limit
Texas hold'em poker. We present Obscuro, the first superhuman AI for FoW chess.
It introduces advances to search in imperfect-information games, enabling
strong, scalable reasoning. Experiments against the prior state-of-the-art AI
and human players -- including the world's best -- show that Obscuro is
significantly stronger. FoW chess is the largest (by amount of imperfect
information) turn-based game in which superhuman performance has been achieved
and the largest game in which imperfect-information search has been
successfully applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在激励探索模型中，设计激励兼容算法的主要挑战在于如何高效获取初始数据，以避免高维上下文下初始探索阶段的指数级样本复杂度问题。

Method: 论文采用线性赌博机模型，假设动作位于欧几里得单位球内，并提出了一种激励兼容的探索算法。

Result: 该算法的样本复杂度与维度及其他参数呈多项式关系，表明在温和的几何条件下，激励兼容性不会阻碍最优遗憾性能的实现。

Conclusion: 通过几何条件约束动作集，论文证明了激励兼容算法可以在多项式样本复杂度下实现最优探索，克服了高维上下文中的探索障碍。

Abstract: In the incentivized exploration model, a principal aims to explore and learn
over time by interacting with a sequence of self-interested agents. It has been
recently understood that the main challenge in designing incentive-compatible
algorithms for this problem is to gather a moderate amount of initial data,
after which one can obtain near-optimal regret via posterior sampling. With
high-dimensional contexts, however, this \emph{initial exploration} phase
requires exponential sample complexity in some cases, which prevents efficient
learning unless initial data can be acquired exogenously. We show that these
barriers to exploration disappear under mild geometric conditions on the set of
available actions, in which case incentive-compatibility does not preclude
regret-optimality. Namely, we consider the linear bandit model with actions in
the Euclidean unit ball, and give an incentive-compatible exploration algorithm
with sample complexity that scales polynomially with the dimension and other
parameters.

*Han Shao,Shuo Xie,Kunhe Yang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在战略分类中限制智能体访问当前分类器对决策者性能的影响，发现隐藏分类器可能导致决策者错误率增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在在线战略分类中，决策者通常公开分类器，但实践中是否公开存在争议。本文探讨限制智能体访问分类器如何影响决策者性能。

Method: 扩展在线战略分类模型，假设智能体无法直接获取当前分类器，而是基于历史分类器的加权平均进行特征操纵。

Result: 决策者错误率比完全公开设置高出$(1-\gamma)^{-1}$或$k_{\text{in}}$倍，其中$k_{\text{in}}$是操纵图的最大入度，$\gamma$是智能体对历史分类器的记忆折扣因子。

Conclusion: 隐藏分类器可能适得其反，导致决策者在在线战略分类中的性能下降。

Abstract: Strategic classification addresses a learning problem where a decision-maker
implements a classifier over agents who may manipulate their features in order
to receive favorable predictions. In the standard model of online strategic
classification, in each round, the decision-maker implements and publicly
reveals a classifier, after which agents perfectly best respond based on this
knowledge. However, in practice, whether to disclose the classifier is often
debated -- some decision-makers believe that hiding the classifier can prevent
misclassification errors caused by manipulation.
  In this paper, we formally examine how limiting the agents' access to the
current classifier affects the decision-maker's performance. Specifically, we
consider an extended online strategic classification setting where agents lack
direct knowledge about the current classifier and instead manipulate based on a
weighted average of historically implemented classifiers. Our main result shows
that in this setting, the decision-maker incurs $(1-\gamma)^{-1}$ or
$k_{\text{in}}$ times more mistakes compared to the full-knowledge setting,
where $k_{\text{in}}$ is the maximum in-degree of the manipulation graph
(representing how many distinct feature vectors can be manipulated to appear as
a single one), and $\gamma$ is the discount factor indicating agents' memory of
past classifiers. Our results demonstrate how withholding access to the
classifier can backfire and degrade the decision-maker's performance in online
strategic classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POSG在完全连续环境下难以高效规划，需依赖离线计算或强假设。论文旨在解决在线信息获取与规划问题，提升博弈智能体的实时决策能力。

Method: 采用有限历史/视野精炼POSG框架，结合粒子估计联合状态空间和随机梯度策略，实现在线轨迹规划，并适配多智能体部署。

Result: 方法在连续追逃、仓库拣选及多玩家复杂环境中验证，表现出主动信息获取能力，显著优于被动策略竞争者。

Conclusion: 所提方法为连续POSG提供了可行的在线规划方案，通过动态信息获取优化博弈策略，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Game-theoretic agents must make plans that optimally gather information about
their opponents. These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic
games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without
heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by
each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which
admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and
through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing
rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based
estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We
also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on
individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and
warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more
complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating
evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文提出RL-RPL-UA协议，利用强化学习优化水下物联网路由，提升传输效率并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由协议（如RPL）在水下环境中表现不佳，因水下网络存在带宽低、延迟高、移动性强及能量有限等挑战。

Method: 设计RL-RPL-UA协议，节点配备轻量级强化学习代理，基于本地信息（如丢包率、缓冲水平等）动态选择最佳父节点，兼容标准RPL消息。

Result: 仿真显示，相比传统方法，RL-RPL-UA提升9.2%数据包投递率，降低14.8%单包能耗，延长网络寿命80秒。

Conclusion: RL-RPL-UA是一种高效节能的水下网络路由解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low
bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional
routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not
perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a
new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in
underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects
the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio,
buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full
compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function
to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that
RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per
packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to
traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and
energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双层框架，结合客观网络参数和主观用户评论来评估直播平台的体验质量(QoE)，通过机器学习和大语言模型实现精准预测与分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QoE评估往往依赖单一视角（纯网络指标或纯用户反馈），难以全面捕捉真实用户体验。该研究旨在融合运营商侧网络数据与用户主观反馈，构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 1) 基于ITU-T P.1203标准训练机器学习模型预测视频质量；2) 使用大语言模型处理34,000条直播评论生成主观MOS分数；3) 提出delta MOS指标量化运营商与平台平均体验的偏差。

Result: 构建了包含47,894条标注评论的数据集，在模拟断网实验中仅通过评论趋势即可有效识别服务中断，验证了框架的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现网络指标与用户情感的实时关联分析，为运营商提供了可扩展、可解释的QoE监测工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side
quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network
modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming
platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained
on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference
implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality
using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and
throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On
the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that
processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related
feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to
filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support
scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894
live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant
through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated
Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic
timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level
aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS
metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from
platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in
the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation
confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions
through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its
own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling
real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with
objective network-based QoE estimates.

Motivation: 固体中的缺陷对材料的力学和功能性质有重要影响，但非破坏性表征和量化多类型共存缺陷仍是一个长期挑战。

Method: 利用16,000多个模拟振动光谱数据训练DefectNet模型，采用定制注意力机制识别多达六种缺陷元素，浓度范围0.2%至25%。

Result: 模型在56种元素的未见晶体上表现良好，并通过SiGe合金和MgB₂超导体的实验验证了其准确性和可转移性。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了振动光谱作为体材料中点缺陷量化的可行非破坏性探测手段，展示了基础模型在数据驱动缺陷工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Defects are ubiquitous in solids and strongly influence materials' mechanical
and functional properties. However, non-destructive characterization and
quantification of defects, especially when multiple types coexist, remain a
long-standing challenge. Here we introduce DefectNet, a foundation machine
learning model that predicts the chemical identity and concentration of
substitutional point defects with multiple coexisting elements directly from
vibrational spectra, specifically phonon density-of-states (PDoS). Trained on
over 16,000 simulated spectra from 2,000 semiconductors, DefectNet employs a
tailored attention mechanism to identify up to six distinct defect elements at
concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 25%. The model generalizes well to unseen
crystals across 56 elements and can be fine-tuned on experimental data.
Validation using inelastic scattering measurements of SiGe alloys and MgB$_2$
superconductor demonstrates its accuracy and transferability. Our work
establishes vibrational spectroscopy as a viable, non-destructive probe for
point defect quantification in bulk materials, and highlights the promise of
foundation models in data-driven defect engineering.

Conclusion: 该方法为STM图像的高效、材料无关的自动分割迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique for imaging
surfaces with atomic resolution, providing insight into physical and chemical
processes at the level of single atoms and molecules. A regular task of STM
image analysis is the identification and labelling of features of interest
against a uniform background. Performing this manually is a labour-intensive
task, requiring significant human effort. To reduce this burden, we propose an
automated approach to the segmentation of STM images that uses both few-shot
learning and unsupervised learning. Our technique offers greater flexibility
compared to previous supervised methods; it removes the requirement for large
manually annotated datasets and is thus easier to adapt to an unseen surface
while still maintaining a high accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by using it to recognise atomic features on three distinct
surfaces: Si(001), Ge(001), and TiO$_2$(110), including adsorbed AsH$_3$
molecules on the silicon and germanium surfaces. Our model exhibits strong
generalisation capabilities, and following initial training, can be adapted to
unseen surfaces with as few as one additional labelled data point. This work is
a significant step towards efficient and material-agnostic, automatic
segmentation of STM images.

Conclusion: 纳米颗粒与植物成分结合的局部凝胶为银屑病治疗提供了新途径，建议进一步研究其长期安全性和疗效。

Abstract: Psoriasis is a long-term inflammatory skin disease that remains difficult to
treat. In this study, we developed a new topical treatment by combining metal
oxide nanoparticles: cerium oxide (CeO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silver (Ag),
with natural plant extracts in a gel made from fish collagen and agar. The
nanoparticles were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), showing good stability and a uniform particle size
distribution (ZnO averaged 66 nm).
  To enhance therapeutic potential, the gel was enriched with plant-derived
antioxidants from bitter melon, ginger, and neem. This formulation was tested
on an animal model of psoriasis. The treated group exhibited faster wound
healing and reduced inflammation compared to both placebo and untreated groups,
with statistically significant results (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001) observed from
Day 3, becoming more pronounced by Day 14.
  These results indicate that the combination of nanoparticles with plant-based
components in a topical gel may provide a promising new approach to psoriasis
treatment. Further studies are recommended to evaluate long-term safety and
therapeutic effectiveness.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research
area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex

synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures,

to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how
factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making
processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and
outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches
can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and
under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide
researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and

Motivation: 近年来，'Agentic AI'和'Multiagentic AI'等术语在生成式人工智能讨论中流行，但这些术语的使用与AI文献中已有的智能代理和多代理系统概念混淆，可能导致对领域知识的忽视。

Method: 论文回顾了'agentic'在社会科学中的理论起源和哲学中的意向性概念，总结了智能代理和多代理系统的基础研究，并分析了从简单反应式代理到BDI模型的经典代理架构。

Conclusion: 论文主张在基于大语言模型的新型AI代理研究中，应采用已有的严谨术语和知识体系，避免重复造轮子，促进科学技术的严谨发展。

Abstract: The terms Agentic AI and Multiagentic AI have recently gained popularity in
discussions on generative artificial intelligence, often used to describe
autonomous software agents and systems composed of such agents. However, the
use of these terms confuses these buzzwords with well-established concepts in
AI literature: intelligent agents and multi-agent systems. This article offers
a critical analysis of this conceptual misuse. We review the theoretical
origins of "agentic" in the social sciences (Bandura, 1986) and philosophical
notions of intentionality (Dennett, 1971), and then summarise foundational
works on intelligent agents and multi-agent systems by Wooldridge, Jennings and
others. We examine classic agent architectures, from simple reactive agents to
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) models, and highlight key properties (autonomy,
reactivity, proactivity, social capability) that define agency in AI. We then
discuss recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and agent platforms
based on LLMs, including the emergence of LLM-powered AI agents and open-source
multi-agent orchestration frameworks. We argue that the term AI Agentic is
often used as a buzzword for what are essentially AI agents, and AI
Multiagentic for what are multi-agent systems. This confusion overlooks decades
of research in the field of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. The
article advocates for scientific and technological rigour and the use of
established terminology from the state of the art in AI, incorporating the
wealth of existing knowledge, including standards for multi-agent system
platforms, communication languages and coordination and cooperation algorithms,
agreement technologies (automated negotiation, argumentation, virtual
organisations, trust, reputation, etc.), into the new and promising wave of
LLM-based AI agents, so as not to end up reinventing the wheel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子-文本数据集规模小且信息不足，限制了多模态模型的训练和泛化能力。

Method: 通过合成文本生成流程整合结构特征、计算属性、生物活性数据和合成复杂性，使用GPT-4o-mini为ChEMBL35中的分子生成结构化描述。

Result: MolTextNet支持多种下游任务，如属性预测和结构检索，预训练模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MolTextNet为分子科学中的基础多模态建模提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Small molecules are essential to drug discovery, and graph-language models
hold promise for learning molecular properties and functions from text.
However, existing molecule-text datasets are limited in scale and
informativeness, restricting the training of generalizable multimodal models.
We present MolTextNet, a dataset of 2.5 million high-quality molecule-text
pairs designed to overcome these limitations. To construct it, we propose a
synthetic text generation pipeline that integrates structural features,
computed properties, bioactivity data, and synthetic complexity. Using
GPT-4o-mini, we create structured descriptions for 2.5 million molecules from
ChEMBL35, with text over 10 times longer than prior datasets. MolTextNet
supports diverse downstream tasks, including property prediction and structure
retrieval. Pretraining CLIP-style models with Graph Neural Networks and
ModernBERT on MolTextNet yields improved performance, highlighting its
potential for advancing foundational multimodal modeling in molecular science.

### [789] [ProtInvTree: Deliberate Protein Inverse Folding with Reward-guided Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00925)
*Mengdi Liu,Xiaoxue Cheng,Zhangyang Gao,Hong Chang,Cheng Tan,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: ProtInvTree是一种基于奖励引导的树搜索框架，用于蛋白质逆折叠，能生成多样且结构一致的序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在蛋白质逆折叠中忽视了问题的一对多特性，即多种序列可折叠为同一结构，因此需要能生成多样序列的模型。

Method: ProtInvTree采用两步聚焦与接地动作机制，结合跳跃去噪策略，利用预训练蛋白质语言模型进行序列生成。

Result: ProtInvTree在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，生成结构一致且多样化的序列。

Conclusion: ProtInvTree通过树搜索框架有效解决了蛋白质逆折叠中的多样性与结构一致性平衡问题。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as
protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by
recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the
problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This
motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse
sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off,
we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for
protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a
deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of
multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through
self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage
focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and
residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a
jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained
protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by
expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically,
ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks,
generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far
from the native ground truth.

### [790] [Robot-R1: Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Embodied Reasoning in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00070)
*Dongyoung Kim,Sumin Park,Huiwon Jang,Jinwoo Shin,Jaehyung Kim,Younggyo Seo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出Robot-R1框架，通过强化学习优化机器人控制的具身推理任务，性能超越传统监督微调方法和GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调（SFT）方法在机器人控制任务中存在数据集构建随意、易导致灾难性遗忘和泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: 基于专家演示数据，利用强化学习框架预测任务关键点状态，并通过推理响应采样强化准确预测。

Result: 7B参数的Robot-R1在低阶动作控制推理任务上表现优于SFT和GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能有效提升LVLMs在机器人控制任务中的具身推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in
advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common
approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control
using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often
heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot
control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting
and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we
introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to
enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to
predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on
the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert
demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples
reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate
predictions. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform
SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters,
Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action
control, such as spatial and primitive movement reasoning.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, in industrial
robotics enhances operational efficiency and human-robot collaboration.
However, the computational complexity and size of these models often provide
latency problems in request and response times. This study explores the
integration of the ChatGPT natural language model with the Robot Operating
System 2 (ROS 2) to mitigate interaction latency and improve robotic system
control within a simulated Gazebo environment. We present an architecture that
integrates these technologies without requiring a middleware transport
platform, detailing how a simulated mobile robot responds to text and voice
commands. Experimental results demonstrate that this integration improves
execution speed, usability, and accessibility of the human-robot interaction by
decreasing the communication latency by 7.01\% on average. Such improvements
facilitate smoother, real-time robot operations, which are crucial for
industrial automation and precision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如拓扑地图）无法建模瞬态物体关系，而密集神经表示（如NeRF）计算成本过高，需一种能平衡效率与动态语义理解的解决方案。

Method: 构建全局拓扑图编码静态环境，动态子图捕捉物体位置关系和人机交互，通过语义空间约束将二者分层融合，并利用LLM解析场景图生成可执行指令。

Result: 实验证明该方法在动态场景表示上优于基线，实际部署中移动机械臂可零训练完成食堂助手等复杂任务。

Conclusion: Hi-Dyna Graph通过分层动态场景图与LLM的结合，为机器人在人机共存环境中的自主操作提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Autonomous operation of service robotics in human-centric scenes remains
challenging due to the need for understanding of changing environments and
context-aware decision-making. While existing approaches like topological maps
offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object
relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur
prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene
representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna
Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates
persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic
autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D
inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g.,
furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic
subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns.
A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global
topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as
the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is
employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and
generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct
complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation
effectiveness. Real-world deployments validate the system's practicality with a
mobile manipulator: robotics autonomously complete complex tasks with no
further training or complex rewarding in a dynamic scene as cafeteria
assistant. See https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hi-Dyna-Graph-B326 for video

### [793] [LoHoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00411)
*Yi Yang,Jiaxuan Sun,Siqi Kou,Yihan Wang,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LoHoVLA是一个新的统一视觉语言动作框架，用于解决长视野任务中的高层次任务规划和低层次运动控制问题，通过共享表示和分层闭环控制机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的具身智能体面临长视野任务，需要高层次任务分解和低层次动作控制。现有的视觉语言动作模型在规划上表现不佳，分层架构则存在协调问题。

Method: LoHoVLA利用预训练的视觉语言模型作为主干，联合生成语言和动作令牌，分别用于子任务生成和机器人动作预测，并采用分层闭环控制机制减少错误。

Result: 实验结果表明，LoHoVLA在Ravens模拟器中的长视野具身任务上显著优于分层和标准视觉语言动作方法。

Conclusion: 统一架构在提升具身智能的泛化能力方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by
high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions.
Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e.,
decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e.,
generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA)
models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the
former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination
issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework
for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA
leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to
jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot
action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better
generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical
closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both
high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce
LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon
tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations,
linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that
LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches
on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings
underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为机器人嗅觉领域提供了基础性进展，解决了有限嗅觉数据和传感器模糊性带来的挑战，是一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for
autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL
methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute
odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor
resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning
method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization
accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset
construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative
process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the
limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs,
enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously
documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using
advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through
electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing,
and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of
olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their
correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in
environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a
foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable
solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor
ambiguities.

### [795] [Multi-Objective Neural Network Assisted Design Optimization of Soft Fin-Ray Grippers for Enhanced Grasping Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00494)
*Ali Ghanizadeh,Ali Ahmadi,Arash Bahrami*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究通过有限元分析和多层感知器预测软Fin-Ray夹持器的接触力和位移，并利用多目标优化算法NSGA-II平衡夹持力与精细操作的矛盾，优化设计参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fin-Ray夹持器因其适应性强、能安全抓取不同形状大小的物体而备受关注，但其非线性抓取力与变形行为的建模存在挑战，且高刚性夹持器虽能施加更大力量却牺牲了精细操作能力，形成多目标优化问题。

Method: 采用有限元法(FEM)模拟夹持圆柱体时的变形与接触力，构建数据集训练多层感知器(MLP)预测目标参数，并利用非支配排序遗传算法(NSGA-II)进行多目标优化。

Result: 研究实现了夹持器最大接触力与尖端位移的预测模型，通过NSGA-II获得帕累托最优解集，平衡了高力抓取与精细操作的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了软体夹持器的设计参数选择，可同时满足精细抓取和高力应用场景的需求。

Abstract: Soft Fin-Ray grippers can perform delicate and careful manipulation, which
has caused notable attention in different fields. These grippers can handle
objects of various forms and sizes safely. The internal structure of the
Fin-Ray finger plays a significant role in its adaptability and grasping
performance. However, modeling the non-linear grasp force and deformation
behaviors for design purposes is challenging. Moreover, when the Fin-Ray finger
becomes more rigid and capable of exerting higher forces, it becomes less
delicate in handling objects. The contrast between these two objectives gives
rise to a multi-objective optimization problem. In this study, we employ finite
element method (FEM) to estimate the deflections and contact forces of the
Fin-Ray, grasping cylindrical objects. This dataset is then used to construct a
multilayer perception (MLP) for prediction of the contact force and the tip
displacement. The FEM dataset consists of three input and four target features.
The three input features of the MLP and optimization design variables are the
thickness of the front and supporting beams, the thickness of the cross beams,
and the equal spacing between the cross beams. In addition, the target features
are the maximum contact forces and maximum tip displacements in x- and
y-directions. The magnitude of maximum contact force and magnitude of maximum
tip displacement are the two objectives, showing the trade-off between force
and delicate manipulation in soft Fin-Ray grippers. Furthermore, the optimized
set of solutions are found using multi-objective optimal techniques. We use
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) method for this purpose. Our
findings demonstrate that our methodologies can be used to improve the design
and gripping performance of soft robotic grippers, helping us to choose a
design not only for delicate grasping but also for high-force applications.

### [796] [Evaluating Robot Policies in a World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00613)
*Julian Quevedo,Percy Liang,Sherry Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于世界模型的策略评估方法（WPE），通过训练视频生成模型模拟真实环境，结合蒙特卡洛推演和视觉语言模型进行策略评估，尽管对动作价值的估计存在偏差，但能保持策略的相对排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人策略评估在现实世界中成本高昂，而手工模拟往往无法准确反映真实条件，导致模拟评估与现实结果相关性差。因此，需要一种更高效且准确的评估方法。

Method: 论文首先训练了一个动作条件视频生成模型作为真实环境的代理，提出了块自回归扩散变换器（Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer）以减少误差累积，并使用视觉语言模型（VLM）作为奖励函数进行蒙特卡洛推演。

Result: WPE对分布内动作的策略价值倾向于低估，对分布外动作则高估，但能保持策略的相对排序。在模拟机器人执行时，WPE能高保真地模仿机械臂运动，但对物体交互的模拟仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，世界模型可作为机器人策略在现实部署前的评估起点，为策略优化提供有效参考。

Abstract: Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care
of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as
real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to
accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between
simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate
World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned
video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable
efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error
accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call
Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and
decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action
input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video
and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the
world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing
Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model
(VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to
underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate
policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the
relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions,
WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos,
while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging.
Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting
point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DriveMind提出了一种统一的语义奖励框架，结合视觉语言模型和分层安全模块，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的性能和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶系统缺乏可解释性和安全性保证，且现有方法在动态场景中适应性不足。

Method: DriveMind整合了对比视觉语言模型编码器、动态提示生成、分层安全模块和预测世界模型。

Result: 在CARLA Town 2中实现了19.4 km/h平均速度、0.98路线完成率和接近零碰撞，成功率提升4%。

Conclusion: DriveMind展示了强大的跨域适应能力，具备实际部署潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems map sensor data directly to control
commands, but remain opaque, lack interpretability, and offer no formal safety
guarantees. While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL)
methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and
fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present
DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a
contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic
anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via
chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon
semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic
constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact
predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states.
DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route
completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines
by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real
dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust
cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 当前机器人协同设计存在因固定奖励函数导致收敛至次优设计的问题，限制了不同形态下多样化运动模式的探索。

Method: RoboMoRe框架采用双阶段优化：粗优化阶段通过LLM生成多样化形态-奖励对；细优化阶段通过交替更新奖励和形态梯度迭代优化候选方案。

Result: 在八项任务中，RoboMoRe无需任务特定提示或预定义模板，性能显著超越人工设计和其他方法。

Conclusion: RoboMoRe通过LLM驱动的形态与奖励协同优化，有效解决了机器人协同设计中的局限性，实现了更优的形态与运动行为匹配。

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a
longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots
have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge
to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to
explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we
propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates
morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design
loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization
stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and
high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their
distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively
refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates.
RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion
behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any
task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe
significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across
eight different tasks.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is a crucial yet highly complex challenge in humanoid
robotics, demanding precise, adaptable, and sample-efficient learning methods.
As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric
environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous
manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches,
such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant
strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world
dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training
data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for dexterous
manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid
approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation
learning, where human feedback actively refines a robot's behavior during
training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various
robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To
address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques
applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to
enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this
paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and
outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to
improve dexterous robotic skills.

Abstract: Robots with multi-modal locomotion are an active research field due to their
versatility in diverse environments. In this context, additional actuation can
provide humanoid robots with aerial capabilities. Flying humanoid robots face
challenges in modeling and control, particularly with aerodynamic forces. This
paper addresses these challenges from a technological and scientific

Motivation: 机器人学中的核心问题常被建模为约束优化问题，但系统存在不确定性或需要寻找多个高质量可行解。现有方法难以满足这些需求。

Method: 开发了两种基于Stein变分梯度下降的新框架，支持多种约束优化器并处理任意约束条件。

Abstract: Many core problems in robotics can be framed as constrained optimization
problems. Often on these problems, the robotic system has uncertainty, or it
would be advantageous to identify multiple high quality feasible solutions. To
enable this, we present two novel frameworks for applying principles of
constrained optimization to the new variational inference algorithm Stein
variational gradient descent. Our general framework supports multiple types of
constrained optimizers and can handle arbitrary constraints. We demonstrate on
a variety of problems that we are able to learn to approximate distributions
without violating constraints. Specifically, we show that we can build
distributions of: robot motion plans that exactly avoid collisions, robot arm
joint angles on the SE(3) manifold with exact table placement constraints, and

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential to perform complex tasks in human centered
environments but require robust predictive models to reason about the outcomes
of their actions. We introduce Humanoid World Models (HWM) a family of
lightweight open source video based models that forecast future egocentric
observations conditioned on actions. We train two types of generative models
Masked Transformers and FlowMatching on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations.
Additionally we explore architectural variants with different attention
mechanisms and parameter sharing strategies. Our parameter sharing techniques
reduce model size by 33 to 53 with minimal impact on performance or visual
fidelity. HWM is designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and
small lab settings such as 1 to 2 GPUs.

*Ishika Singh,Ankit Goyal,Stan Birchfield,Dieter Fox,Animesh Garg,Valts Blukis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OG-VLA结合视觉语言动作模型（VLA）的泛化能力和3D感知策略的鲁棒性，通过多视角RGBD观测和自然语言指令映射到机器人动作，实现了在未见过的环境和指令中的优异泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D感知机器人策略在精确操作任务上表现优异，但在面对未见过的指令、场景和物体时泛化能力不足；而VLA模型虽擅长跨指令和场景泛化，但对相机和机器人姿态变化敏感。OG-VLA旨在结合两者的优势，提升机器人策略的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: OG-VLA将多视角观测投影为点云，并通过标准正交视图渲染，确保输入视角不变性及输入输出空间一致性。随后利用视觉主干网络、大语言模型（LLM）和图像扩散模型生成编码末端执行器位置和方向的图像。

Result: 在Arnold和Colosseum基准测试中，OG-VLA在未见环境中的泛化性能提升超过40%，同时在已知场景中保持鲁棒性。仅需3到5次演示即可实现真实世界的快速适应。

Conclusion: OG-VLA通过结合VLA的泛化能力和3D感知策略的鲁棒性，显著提升了机器人策略在多样化场景和指令中的适应性，为机器人操作任务提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that
combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs)
with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping
natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static
robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on
precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen
instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at
generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and
robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and
vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe
policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point
cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input
view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These
canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model
(LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next
position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on
the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization
to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining
robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5
demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at

*Junha Chun,Youngjoon Jeong,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种稀疏想象的视觉世界模型规划方法，通过减少前向预测处理的token数量提升计算效率，适用于资源受限的实时决策场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在复杂环境中提升决策能力，但高精度预测需要大量计算资源，尤其在资源受限的机器人领域难以实时应用。

Method: 基于稀疏训练的视觉世界模型，采用分组注意力策略，动态调整处理的token数量以实现高效规划。

Result: 实验表明，稀疏想象在保持任务性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为世界模型在实时决策中的部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in
complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make
informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models
often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for
real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive
in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this
limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model
Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of
tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely
trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped
attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of
tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse
imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while
maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse
imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference
efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time
decision-making scenarios.

*Guobin Zhu,Rui Zhou,Wenkang Ji,Shiyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLM）和多智能体强化学习（MARL）的新方法LAMARL，显著提高了样本效率并减少了人工设计需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在复杂多机器人任务中有效，但存在样本效率低和需要手动调整奖励函数的问题。大语言模型（LLM）在单机器人任务中表现出潜力，但在多机器人系统中应用较少。

Method: LAMARL包含两个模块：第一个模块利用LLM自动生成先验策略和奖励函数；第二个模块是MARL，使用生成的函数有效指导机器人策略训练。

Result: 在形状组装基准测试中，仿真和真实实验均显示LAMARL的独特优势。先验策略平均提高样本效率185.9%，基于Chain-of-Thought的结构化提示将LLM输出成功率提高28.5%-67.5%。

Conclusion: LAMARL通过结合LLM和MARL，显著提升了多机器人系统的样本效率和任务完成率，减少了人工干预需求。

Abstract: Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is effective for complex
multi-robot tasks, it suffers from low sample efficiency and requires iterative
manual reward tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
single-robot settings, but their application in multi-robot systems remains
largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel LLM-Aided MARL (LAMARL)
approach, which integrates MARL with LLMs, significantly enhancing sample
efficiency without requiring manual design. LAMARL consists of two modules: the
first module leverages LLMs to fully automate the generation of prior policy
and reward functions. The second module is MARL, which uses the generated
functions to guide robot policy training effectively. On a shape assembly
benchmark, both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the unique
advantages of LAMARL. Ablation studies show that the prior policy improves
sample efficiency by an average of 185.9% and enhances task completion, while
structured prompts based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and basic APIs improve LLM
output success rates by 28.5%-67.5%. Videos and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于频域表示和连续潜在表征的视觉运动策略学习新方法，通过分层建模频率分量提升机器人操作的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动作表示和网络架构上存在固有局限，无法同时满足精确性和计算效率的需求。频域分析揭示动作的结构化特性（低频全局运动、高频局部细节），且不同任务需不同频段的建模精度。

Method: 提出渐进式分层频率分量建模范式，并引入保持动作空间平滑性的连续潜在表征，构建频域自回归框架。

Result: 在多种2D/3D机器人操作任务中，该方法在精度和效率上均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 频域表示与连续令牌的结合为通用机器人操作提供了有效解决方案，验证了该框架的潜力。

Abstract: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is
challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining
computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to
inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic
network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency
domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency
components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components
encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying
complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency
bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy
learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To
further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that
maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments
across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with
continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出WoMAP方法，通过高斯泼溅和世界模型提升机器人开放词汇目标定位能力，实现零样本任务高效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在泛化性（模仿学习）或物理动作生成（VLMs）方面存在局限，需开发无需专家示范且能生成物理可行动作的新方案。

Method: 采用高斯泼溅构建真实-仿真-真实数据管道，利用开放词汇检测器提取密集奖励信号，并通过潜在世界模型预测动态和奖励以指导动作。

Result: WoMAP在零样本任务中成功率分别超过VLM和扩散策略基线9倍和2倍，并在TidyBot上验证了强泛化与仿真-现实迁移能力。

Conclusion: WoMAP为开放词汇目标定位提供了可扩展、高效的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for
robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments.
However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond
demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate
physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training
open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian
Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation
without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals
from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model
for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at
inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate
WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization
tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and
diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves
strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Riemannian Time Warping (RTW)的新方法，用于在黎曼流形上高效对齐多个信号，优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间对齐方法大多局限于欧几里得空间数据，而在机器人学等领域，处理黎曼流形上的数据对齐需求日益重要。

Method: RTW方法通过考虑数据嵌入的黎曼流形几何结构，实现了多信号的时间对齐。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（包括LBR iiwa机器人测试）上的实验表明，RTW在平均和分类任务中均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RTW为黎曼流形上的时间对齐提供了一种有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Temporal alignment of multiple signals through time warping is crucial in
many fields, such as classification within speech recognition or robot motion
learning. Almost all related works are limited to data in Euclidean space.
Although an attempt was made in 2011 to adapt this concept to unit quaternions,
a general extension to Riemannian manifolds remains absent. Given its
importance for numerous applications in robotics and beyond, we introduce
Riemannian Time Warping~(RTW). This novel approach efficiently aligns multiple
signals by considering the geometric structure of the Riemannian manifold in
which the data is embedded. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
data, including tests with an LBR iiwa robot, demonstrate that RTW consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both averaging and classification
tasks.

Conclusion: FeelTheForce系统将可扩展的人类监督与精确力控相结合，为力敏感操作任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling fine-grained forces during manipulation remains a core challenge
in robotics. While robot policies learned from robot-collected data or
simulation show promise, they struggle to generalize across the diverse range
of real-world interactions. Learning directly from humans offers a scalable
solution, enabling demonstrators to perform skills in their natural embodiment
and in everyday environments. However, visual demonstrations alone lack the
information needed to infer precise contact forces. We present FeelTheForce
(FTF): a robot learning system that models human tactile behavior to learn
force-sensitive manipulation. Using a tactile glove to measure contact forces
and a vision-based model to estimate hand pose, we train a closed-loop policy
that continuously predicts the forces needed for manipulation. This policy is
re-targeted to a Franka Panda robot with tactile gripper sensors using shared
visual and action representations. At execution, a PD controller modulates
gripper closure to track predicted forces-enabling precise, force-aware
control. Our approach grounds robust low-level force control in scalable human
supervision, achieving a 77% success rate across 5 force-sensitive manipulation
tasks. Code and videos are available at https://feel-the-force-ftf.github.io.
