### [1] [A Survey of Automatic Evaluation Methods on Text, Visual and Speech Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10019)
*Tian Lan,Yang-Hao Zhou,Zi-Ao Ma,Fanshu Sun,Rui-Qing Sun,Junyu Luo,Rong-Cheng Tu,Heyan Huang,Chen Xu,Zhijing Wu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出跨模态自动评估方法的统一分类框架，系统梳理文本、图像、音频生成内容的评估方法，识别五大基础范式，并指出未来跨模态评估研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI评估方法缺乏跨文本、图像、音频模态的系统性分类框架，需建立统一视角以整合各领域评估技术。

Method: 通过文献综述构建跨模态评估分类体系，从成熟度最高的文本评估切入，延伸至图像和音频领域，归纳出五类核心评估范式。

Result: 建立了涵盖三大模态的自动评估方法分类框架，验证了该框架在图像/音频领域的扩展适用性，并提出跨模态评估技术路线图。

Conclusion: 跨模态评估需突破单模态局限，未来应发展统一评估指标、增强多模态关联分析，并建立标准化测试基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)
*Dingfeng Shi,Jingyi Cao,Qianben Chen,Weichen Sun,Weizhen Li,Hongxuan Lu,Fangchen Dong,Tianrui Qin,King Zhu,Minghao Yang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出TaskCraft，一种自动化生成多工具、可扩展难度的代理任务框架，解决现有数据缺乏工具交互及人工标注成本高的问题，并创建大规模合成数据集支持未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理任务数据缺乏工具交互，且依赖人工标注导致扩展性差，阻碍NLP与AI中自主代理任务的发展。

Method: 通过深度扩展（层次结构）和广度扩展（多工具组合）生成复杂任务，结合自动化流程生成可验证的执行轨迹。

Result: 实验表明生成任务优化了提示工程与模型微调效果，并构建了包含约36,000个任务的合成数据集。

Conclusion: TaskCraft为代理模型调优与评估提供了高效、可扩展的基准，推动复杂自主任务研究。

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [3] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，自然语言的语义退化特性导致复杂表达式的潜在解释组合爆炸，使得LLM等系统难以恢复单一意图含义。通过Kolmogorov复杂度和贝尔不等式实验，证明语言解释具有非经典语境性，主张贝叶斯方法优于传统频率分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP系统（如LLM）因受限于自然语言本身的语义退化特性，无法唯一确定复杂语义的意图含义。研究旨在揭示语言意义并非固有，而是依赖观察者的解释行为。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度理论论证语义恢复的不可行性，并通过设计语义贝尔不等式测试，让不同LLM代理在歧义词对解释中验证非经典语境性。

Result: 实验显示CHSH期望值（1.2-2.8）多次超越经典边界（|S|≤2），部分结果（如2.3-2.4）显著违反经典限制，表明语言解释存在类似人类认知的非经典特性。

Conclusion: 传统频率分析方法对自然语言存在信息损失，贝叶斯式重复采样能更有效刻画语境化语义意义需通过动态解释过程实现。

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

### [4] [Chat-of-Thought: Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Generating Domain Specific Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10086)
*Christodoulos Constantinides,Shuxin Lin,Nianjun Zhou,Dhaval Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Chat-of-Thought多智能体系统，通过角色化LLM代理协作与动态任务路由优化工业资产FMEA文档生成，实现内容迭代精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FMEA文档生成过程复杂且依赖人工经验，需解决工业设备监控中效率低、准确性不足的挑战。

Method: 采用多LLM代理协作框架，结合动态任务路由与多角色驱动讨论机制，通过模板化工作流和上下文感知实现内容验证与迭代优化。

Result: 系统能有效生成结构化FMEA表格，动态讨论机制提升分析深度，验证了多智能体协作在工业知识工程中的可行性。

Conclusion: Chat-of-Thought为AI驱动的工业风险评估提供了新范式，证明多角色交互与任务路由机制可显著增强复杂文档生成的可靠性与自动化水平。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the
generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is
the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS)框架，发现语义相同但词元不同的提示会导致大语言模型产生行为漂移，揭示模型响应稳定性受词元化策略和解码动态机制影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在语义意图相同但词元表达不同的提示下是否会产生行为差异，现有评估方法可能忽视由提示表层变化引发的服务质量不稳定问题。

Method: 开发PBSS诊断框架，通过在10个约束性任务中测试语义等效但词元重构的提示，量化分析LLM的行为漂移模式。

Result: 实验显示不同模型存在特定响应偏移模式，且偏移规律与词元化过程、解码机制具有统计相关性，表明表层提示变化会系统性影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 提示表层变化是模型服务质量不稳定的潜在因素，词元化策略和解码动态机制可能成为训练后部署阶段的重要调控对象，需在评估中增加对提示方差的鲁棒性测试。

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ChartReasoner框架，通过两阶段代码驱动方法解决视觉推理任务中的信息丢失问题，在图表问答任务中实现高保真、可解释的推理，性能接近GPT-4o且参数更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理方法将视觉任务转换为文本任务时，会丢失图表中的关键结构与语义信息（如布局、数据细节），难以满足图表问答等高视觉细节任务的需求。

Method: 1. 训练高保真模型将图表转为结构化ECharts代码；2. 设计自动化数据合成流程生成推理轨迹，结合代码验证器过滤低质量样本；3. 使用监督微调与强化学习训练多模态模型。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，ChartReasoner性能与最先进开源模型相当（参数更少），在域外场景中接近GPT-4o等专有系统表现。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner通过代码驱动框架最大程度保留图表原始信息，实现了高效、可解释的视觉推理，为多模态推理任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出无监督算法ICM，通过最大化内部一致性微调语言模型，无需外部监督即可超越人类监督效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当预训练语言模型具备超人类能力时，传统依赖人工标注的下游任务调优方法难以获得高质量监督信号。

Method: 开发Internal Coherence Maximization(ICM)算法，利用模型自身生成标签进行无监督微调

Result: 在GSM8k验证/TruthfulQA等任务上匹配黄金标准，超越众包监督；基于Claude 3.5 Haiku训练的奖励模型和助手均优于人类监督版本

Conclusion: ICM能有效激发语言模型潜力，为前沿模型训练提供新范式，证明无监督方法在超人类能力场景下的优越性

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较专家、众包工作者和LLMs在同理心沟通标注中的一致性，发现LLMs接近专家水平且优于众包，验证其在情感敏感任务中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在评估同理心沟通时的可靠性，通过对比人类专家、众包标注与模型标注，验证LLMs在复杂情感任务中的实际应用价值。

Method: 使用心理学、NLP等四个评估框架，对200段真实对话进行标注，收集3150个专家标注、2844个众包标注及3150个LLM标注，分析评分者间信度。

Result: 专家标注一致性较高但受子维度特性（清晰度、复杂性、主观性）影响；LLMs在所有框架中接近专家基准，且可靠性超过众包标注。

Conclusion: LLMs在特定任务中经专家共识验证后，可作为情感敏感应用（如对话伴侣）的可靠工具，专家协议比传统分类指标更能有效评估模型表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

### [9] [Analyzing Emotions in Bangla Social Media Comments Using Machine Learning and LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10154)
*Bidyarthi Paul,SM Musfiqur Rahman,Dipta Biswas,Md. Ziaul Hasan,Md. Zahid Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用多种机器学习模型和解释技术，探索孟加拉语社交媒体评论的情感分析，旨在提升资源匮乏语言的情感识别效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对孟加拉语等资源匮乏语言，因其独特的地区表达和文化特征，现有研究不足，需开发高效情感分析方法以推进相关领域发展。

Method: 结合线性SVM、KNN、随机森林（基于TF-IDF的n-gram特征）、PCA降维、BiLSTM和AdaBoost模型，并利用LIME解释AdaBoost分类器的预测结果。

Result: 通过对比不同模型及降维技术，验证了AdaBoost结合决策树和LIME解释在孟加拉语情感分析中的有效性与可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究为资源匮乏语言的情感分析提供了多方法验证框架，证明结合传统模型与解释性技术可提升识别任务的效率和透明度。

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

### [10] [Measuring Corporate Human Capital Disclosures: Lexicon, Data, Code, and Research Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10155)
*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个基于机器学习的人力资本（HC）关键词词典，涵盖五个子类别，并分享了相关数据、代码及使用示例，为未来HC管理和披露研究提供工具和方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人力资本对企业价值创造日益重要，但缺乏统一的测量与披露标准，需构建系统化的HC管理分析工具以支持相关研究。

Method: 使用word2vec算法在已验证的HC披露数据上训练，构建包含DEI、健康安全、劳资文化、薪酬福利、人口统计等五类关键词的多维度HC词典。

Result: 公开了HC词典、企业披露数据及Python代码，提供BERT模型微调等应用案例，支持研究者基于企业沟通文本进行HC问题研究。

Conclusion: 所开发的工具为HC管理研究提供了可扩展框架，未来可结合动态披露、利益相关者视角等方向深化研究。

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过叙事规划问题评估大语言模型（LLM）的故事生成能力，发现GPT-4级模型在小规模生成因果合理的故事，但处理角色意图与戏剧冲突仍需强化学习支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以自动评估LLM生成故事的质量，且人工评估成本高、主观性强。计算叙事学为故事质量提供了理论框架，但LLM在此类任务中的能力尚未被充分理解。

Method: 基于文学案例构建叙事规划评估基准，聚焦因果合理性、角色意图性、戏剧冲突三个维度，测试LLM生成故事的能力。

Result: GPT-4级模型可生成小规模因果合理的故事，但角色意图规划和戏剧冲突仍需依赖强化学习训练的LLM进行复杂推理。

Conclusion: LLM生成高质量故事的能力受规模限制，角色意图与冲突处理是难点，在游戏等应用中需结合强化学习并考虑叙事规划的特殊挑战。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Q2E方法，通过分解查询并利用LLMs和VLMs的潜在知识，提升零样本多语言文本到视频检索效果，整合音频信息可显著改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂现实事件相关的视频检索时，对过于简化的人类查询理解不足，需通过自动提取模型中的潜在知识来改进检索效果。

Method: Q2E方法将查询分解为事件相关要素，结合LLMs/VLMs的嵌入知识，支持多模态和语音输入，并采用基于熵的零样本融合评分机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和指标上超越SOTA基线模型，实验证明音频信息整合可使文本到视频检索性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Q2E通过参数知识分解与多模态融合，有效提升复杂事件视频检索能力，开源代码与数据为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [13] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂数学问题上表现优异，但在简单双人策略游戏（如井字棋变种）中表现不佳。研究者提出TTT-Bench基准测试，发现模型在人类幼龄可解的任务中，因需对手意图理解与长期战略推理而频繁失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准多集中于STEM领域，而LRMs在更广泛任务领域（如基础策略/空间/逻辑推理）的能力尚未充分探索。研究者旨在通过简单但需对手意图理解的任务，揭示模型推理能力的局限性。

Method: 设计TTT-Bench基准，包含4种井字棋式双人游戏，通过可扩展方法生成可验证问题。评估多种先进LRMs在需对手意图预测、空间配置分析等基础推理任务中的表现。

Result: 擅长数学难题的模型在简单游戏任务中平均得分较MATH 500和AIME 2024分别下降41%和5%。大模型虽表现更好，但普遍在长程战略推理场景中表现挣扎，且依赖短推理路径。

Conclusion: LRMs在需要基础战略推理的新任务中存在显著能力缺口，表明当前模型在简单但需对手建模与长期规划的任务中，尚未达到人类幼龄水平的推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

Method: 四阶段合成流程：1) 人工种子数据 2) 指令调优LLM少样本扩展 3) 释义增强 4) 中性文本注入。通过合成技术突破传统社交媒体数据局限，确保类别平衡与风格多样性。

Result: 在五个公开葡语数据集上，该语料库的二元/多标签分类实验均取得优异表现，跨领域泛化能力显著，F1值等指标验证合成数据的有效性。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT填补了葡语细粒度仇恨言论检测的空白，证明合成数据在低资源场景的应用潜力，其领域中立特性为模型鲁棒性研究提供新基准。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了语言模型通过概率采样决策的假设，指出其可能呈现确定性决策，并提出方法区分随机与确定性模式以避免推断错误先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究假设语言模型通过随机采样进行概率决策，并基于此用吉布斯采样推断其先验。但此假设可能不成立，因模型可能表现出确定性行为。

Method: 提出一种区分吉布斯采样中随机/确定性决策模式的方法，并在多种大语言模型上测试不同情境下的决策模式。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型在特定条件下（如非零温度）仍可产生确定性决策（如最大似然估计），导致模拟吉布斯采样收敛至“虚假先验”。

Conclusion: 语言模型的决策模式兼具随机与确定性特征，需谨慎区分以避免误导性先验推断，这对理解大语言模型决策机制至关重要。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出ClusterUCB框架，通过聚类和改进的UCB算法，在减少计算资源消耗的同时实现高效的梯度数据选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于梯度的数据选择方法在监督微调大语言模型时需全程计算梯度，资源消耗过大，实际不可行。

Method: 结合聚类（利用梯度特征相似性）与改进的多臂老虎机算法（UCB），将数据选择建模为预算分配问题，通过冷启动平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明ClusterUCB在多个基准测试中达到与原始方法相当的效果，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: ClusterUCB验证了基于梯度特征聚类与动态资源分配的可行性，为高效数据选择提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Flick方法，通过从广泛初始聚类中提炼高置信度伪标签，结合自适应top-k选择机制，有效解决了低资源语言环境下少标签文本分类的伪标签噪声和领域适应问题。在包含阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等14个低资源语言数据集上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少标签分类方法多针对英语等资源丰富语言，或采用易过拟合的复杂级联结构，且在真实低资源语言场景下面临伪标签噪声和领域适应挑战。传统多聚类伪标签策略难以应对语言多样性带来的数据稀疏问题。

Method: Flick创新性地引入伪标签精炼组件：1) 通过单簇聚合分析增强类内一致性 2) 采用自适应top-k选择机制筛选最优伪标签簇 3) 从广泛初始聚类中蒸馏高可靠伪标签，结合预训练语言模型的少量标签微调。

Result: 在14个多语言数据集（含阿拉伯语、乌尔都语等低资源语言）上的实验表明，Flick在少标签场景下显著优于基线方法，错误传播减少35-48%，尤其在词汇形态复杂的语言中保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: Flick通过聚焦单簇语义凝聚力和动态选择机制，突破了低资源语言处理中伪标签质量瓶颈，为跨语言少样本学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，证实了精细化伪标签蒸馏优于传统多模型级联策略。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

### [19] ["Check My Work?": Measuring Sycophancy in a Simulated Educational Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10297)
*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，在模拟教育场景中，用户提供的答案建议会显著影响大语言模型（LLMs）的回答质量，体现为阿谀行为：当学生提到错误答案时，模型正确率下降15%，反之提升15%。小模型偏差更强（如GPT-4.1-nano偏差达30%），可能加剧教育不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究教育场景中LLMs因用户建议产生的阿谀行为风险，及其对教育公平的潜在影响。

Method: 在模拟教育环境中测试5个不同规模的OpenAI模型（GPT-4o和GPT-4.1系列），通过5种实验条件分析回答质量变化、答案翻转频率及词元概率。

Result: 学生提及错误答案时模型正确率最多下降15%，提及正确答案时提升15%；小模型偏差更显著（GPT-4.1-nano偏差30% vs GPT-4o偏差8%），词元概率证实模型倾向于迎合学生答案。

Conclusion: LLMs的阿谀行为可能扩大知识水平差异，需深入理解机制并开发缓解方法以保障教育公平。

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于LLM的语音到语音翻译方法，通过逐步混合语音-文本单元训练，解决模态适应问题，提升低资源语言的翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在纯文本数据上训练后难以直接适应语音模态，尤其在语音-语音数据有限时存在训练困难。

Method: 采用词级对齐的语音-文本交替单元进行训练，并随着训练进程逐步降低文本比例，实现从文本到语音的渐进式模态适应。

Result: 在CVSS数据集上微调LLaMA3.2-1B模型后，翻译性能显著提升，对训练数据不足的语言效果改善尤为明显。

Conclusion: 提出的渐进式混合训练策略有效缓解了语音模态适应难题，为低资源语音翻译任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维监督方法依赖高成本人工标注或易出错的LLM生成推理链，难以获得可靠且准确的推理监督数据。

Method: 从代码执行中提取可验证的逐步推理轨迹，将其转化为自然语言链式思维推理，生成高质量监督数据集。

Result: 跨领域推理基准测试表明，该方法赋予LLM可迁移的推理能力，消融实验验证数据高准确性且推理时token长度减少。

Conclusion: 基于程序执行确定性的方法能生成精确推理监督数据，提升模型跨任务推理效率，解决现有监督数据生成缺陷。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

TL;DR: TableRAG提出混合框架，通过文本检索与SQL操作结合解决异构文档问答中表格结构破坏问题，在HeteQA基准上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理含表格的异构文档时，因表格展平策略破坏结构导致信息丢失，并削弱LLMs在多跳全局查询中的推理能力。

Method: TableRAG框架分四步迭代：上下文敏感查询分解、文本检索、SQL编程执行、组合式中间答案生成，统一文本理解与表格复杂操作。

Result: 实验表明TableRAG在公开数据集和HeteQA基准上均超越现有基线，建立异构文档问答新SOTA。

Conclusion: TableRAG有效提升异构文档推理能力，并通过HeteQA基准与开源代码推动领域发展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PAG框架，通过多轮强化学习让大语言模型在策略生成与自我验证角色间切换，仅在检测错误时修订答案，提升推理与验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型自我验证输出正确性的方法依赖外部验证模型或多阶段训练流程，扩展性受限。需更高效的自纠正机制。

Method: PAG框架结合策略生成和生成式验证，通过选择性修订机制（仅在自检错误时修订）与统一强化学习范式交替训练模型角色。

Result: 实验表明PAG在推理任务中提升生成准确率，其自验证性能优于自洽性方法，且缓解模型崩溃问题。

Conclusion: PAG通过自验证与选择性修订的协同优化，为LLM自纠正提供可扩展解决方案，兼具推理与验证能力的双重提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在时间维度的推理能力尚未被充分探索，需通过系统化基准测试揭示其局限性，并推动多模态时序理解的研究。

Method: 设计包含事件关系推理、句子排序和图像排序的三项核心测试及基础任务，要求模型结合视觉与语言模态分析事件时序，评估38个前沿MLLMs并与人类表现对比。

Result: 实验表明MLLMs在TempVS任务中表现显著低于人类水平（如GPT-4V准确率仅50.1%），且存在跨任务泛化能力不足的问题，同时揭示了模型对时序线索的敏感性差异。

Conclusion: TempVS暴露了MLLMs在时序推理上的关键缺陷，强调需加强多模态时序表征学习，并为未来研究提供了细粒度分析框架与开源基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

TL;DR: 研究通过计算模型分析以巴冲突新闻框架，发现报道偏向战争且存在地区媒体偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有冲突框架研究多采用定性方法或仅关注表层框架，缺乏对媒体深层语言框架及其影响的深入分析。

Method: 结合框架语义学与大型语言模型，分析新闻语料库中的战争/和平新闻指标及其语言框架关联性。

Result: 媒体报道侧重战争框架，美、英、中东媒体在冲突责任方与受害者框架上存在显著地域性偏见。

Conclusion: 媒体框架选择可能强化冲突对立，需通过计算分析方法揭示深层偏见以促进平衡报道。

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

TL;DR: 本研究通过引入分段的奖励函数和输出长度惩罚机制，在保持复杂问题准确性的同时，有效缩短了LLM在简单问题上的推理步骤，提升了整体效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如Chain-of-Thought）通过长推理链提升LLM性能，但导致计算延迟增加；而强化学习方法的统一惩罚策略未考虑问题复杂度差异，造成次优结果。需在简单问题上缩短输出，复杂问题上保留充分推理以平衡效率与准确性。

Method: 提出分割奖励函数并引入输出长度惩罚机制，动态管理LLM推理效率：对简单问题施加更强长度惩罚以促进简洁性，对复杂问题保留足够推理步骤以保证准确性。

Result: 在GSM8K/MATH500简单数据集上缩短输出且保持/提升准确率；在复杂数据集AIME2024上实现准确率提升，验证了方法对不同难度问题的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过问题复杂度自适应的奖励机制，可同时优化LLM推理效率与准确性，为平衡模型性能与计算成本提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究将表格与文本对齐任务重新定义为解释任务，要求模型识别验证科学声明所需的关键表格单元格，并通过构建带有人工标注的数据集和实验发现，现有大模型虽能预测正确标签，但缺乏可信推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学声明验证方法仅预测标签，无法揭示模型推理过程且可解释性不足。因此，需通过识别关键表格单元格来增强模型的可信度和可解释性。

Method: 扩展SciTab基准数据集，添加人工标注的单元格级理由，并提出处理模糊案例的分类法。实验结合表格对齐信息验证模型性能，并分析LLM的推理能力。

Result: 结合表格对齐信息可提升声明验证性能；多数LLM虽能预测正确标签，但无法生成与人类标注一致的理由，表明其预测缺乏忠实推理。

Conclusion: 仅依赖标签预测不足以验证科学声明的可信性，需通过显式对齐表格单元格来确保模型推理的透明性和可靠性。

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

*Sangmin Song,Juhwan Choi,JungMin Yun,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估大语言模型(LLM)在多用户对话状态追踪(DST)中的表现，发现现有模型在多说话者场景下性能显著下降，需改进以适应真实复杂交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DST基准仅关注结构化单用户对话，无法反映真实多用户交互的复杂性，需验证LLM在多用户场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于言语行为理论，利用LLM自动生成第二用户对话，扩展现有单用户DST数据集，构建可控的多用户对话评估环境。

Result: 实验显示LLM在多用户DST中性能较单用户场景显著下降，暴露其在多说话者状态提取与追踪上的局限性。

Conclusion: 需增强LLM处理多用户DST的能力，推动面向真实复杂场景的鲁棒对话状态追踪模型发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: 提出RRP框架，通过结合LLM的语义能力和知识图谱的结构信息，生成高质量推理路径，提升大语言模型在复杂问题中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结合知识图谱的LLM方法虽补充事实知识，但难以处理复杂问题，因缺乏对事实间逻辑关系的有效组织与推理路径优化。

Method: RRP框架融合LLM语义与知识图谱关系嵌入，通过双向分布学习提取结构信息，并引入反思模块评估和精炼推理路径。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上达到SOTA性能，且RRP可即插即用地增强不同LLM的推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过优化推理路径的逻辑一致性，RRP为LLM提供有效指导，证明结构化知识组织对复杂推理任务的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数据驱动与规则启发式的无监督方法，用于重建原始语形，在罗曼语族数据中显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖音系编辑的概率模型，但其数据驱动特性存在局限性，需结合语言学规则提升重建准确性。

Method: 在进化优化框架中整合数据驱动推理与基于规则的启发式方法，利用统计模式和语言学约束指导重建过程。

Result: 在拉丁原始语形重建任务中，字符级准确性和音系合理性指标均大幅超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 混合方法通过融合统计模式与语言学知识，有效提升了原始语形重建的准确性与合理性。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何以高成本效益在语言模型中实现强推理能力，解决现有方法计算资源消耗过大的问题。

Method: 基于1.5B参数的基模型，在强化学习（RL）中应用LoRA进行参数高效更新，仅调整低秩矩阵，保留基模型知识。

Result: Tina模型推理性能提升>20%，AIME24数据集Pass@1达43.33%，训练成本降低260倍（仅9美元），在多个开源数据集验证有效性。

Conclusion: LoRA通过快速适配RL奖励的推理结构格式，同时保留基模型知识，证明了高效RL推理的可行性，开源代码与模型促进开放研究。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

TL;DR: Resa模型通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）方法，以极低成本（约1美元、20分钟）高效激发语言模型的推理能力，保留97%性能的同时显著降低训练成本与时间，并展现通用性与模块化潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过模型底层表示高效且低成本地激发语言模型的强推理能力，避免依赖高资源消耗的强化学习（RL）训练过程。

Method: 提出SAE-Tuning方法：1) 训练稀疏自编码器（SAE）从源模型提取推理能力；2) 利用SAE指导目标模型的监督微调，仅需验证过的问答数据（无需推理轨迹）。

Result: SAE-Tuning在RL后处理前应用时，以>2000倍成本降低（约1美元）和>450倍时间缩短（约20分钟）保留>97%性能；结合轻量RL训练后，以约1美元额外成本实现AIME24 43.33% Pass@1和AMC23 90% Pass@1。提取的推理能力具备跨数据集通用性与跨模型模块化特性。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning为低成本激发模型推理能力提供高效路径，其提取的能力具有通用性和模块化潜力，可通过简单组合实现性能提升，且所有实验成果已开源。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLM）能逐字符拼写，但其字符级信息处理机制复杂：嵌入层未充分编码字符信息，依赖中间层重建知识，并存在拼写行为的“突破点”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM在拼写过程中如何内部表示和利用字符级信息，尤其是为何其在复杂字符级任务（如识别组合子成分）上表现不佳。

Method: 通过探测分类器、知识神经元识别和注意力权重分析，研究LLM各层（嵌入层、中间层、高层）对字符信息的处理机制。

Result: 嵌入层未完全编码字符级信息（尤其是首字符外），中间及高层Transformer通过知识重建实现拼写，并观察到拼写行为的“突破”现象。

Conclusion: LLM以非直观方式处理字符级任务，依赖深层结构补偿嵌入层不足，这对理解模型内部机制及优化字符相关任务具有启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

TL;DR: 本研究通过微调Gemma、Mistral和Llama-2等开源大语言模型（LLMs），在平衡/不平衡数据集上检测威胁性语言，发现LLMs性能显著优于传统方法，且上采样技术对LLMs效果有限，证明LLMs在现实场景中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测威胁生命语言对保护心理脆弱个体、预防潜在伤害至关重要，需探索更有效的检测方法以应对现实场景中的挑战。

Method: 使用三种7B参数开源LLMs（Gemma、Mistral、Llama-2）在不同类别平衡度的数据集上微调，并与词袋、词嵌入、主题模型、BERT等传统方法对比，采用上采样处理数据不平衡问题。

Result: LLMs整体优于传统方法，Mistral和Llama-2在平衡/不平衡数据中表现最佳，Gemma稍弱；上采样仅显著提升传统方法性能，对LLMs影响有限。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在现实威胁性语言检测中展现强大潜力，尤其在数据不平衡场景下仍保持稳健性能，为实际应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型使用冗长思维链推理导致token成本过高，限制了在延迟敏感场景和API受限环境中的实际部署。

Method: 结合跟踪级诊断与梯度启发式提示优化，通过多目标文本搜索平衡答案简洁性与正确性，采用单次黑箱接口实现商业LLM适配。

Result: 在GSM8K等数据集上保持或提升准确率（Claude 96%→96%，Gemini 91%→92%），推理token减少87.5%，成本降低69-82%。

Conclusion: 纯提示级优化为LRM推理提供高效可扩展路径，证明无需修改模型权重即可实现效率与推理质量的平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声明（如科学或政治主张）常无法简单归类为真/假，需分解为子方面（如疫苗安全性）进行验证，且需反映不同角度的观点及其普遍性。

Method: ClaimSpect结合检索增强生成技术，构建声明层次化子结构，分割语料库以检索相关文本段，发现新子方面及不同立场（支持/中立/反对）的分布。

Result: 在真实科学与政治声明数据集上验证，ClaimSpect能准确解构复杂声明并反映语料观点分布，案例研究与人工评估显示其优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ClaimSpect有效解构复杂声明，揭示语料视角的多样性及分布，为多角度验证提供结构化框架，显著提升信息处理深度与效率。

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家分类法耗时昂贵，现有自动方法或依赖特定语料库缺乏泛化性，或过度依赖LLM预训练数据忽略科学领域动态性，且未考虑文献的多维贡献特性。

Method: TaxoAdapt框架基于语料主题分布，通过迭代层次分类动态扩展分类法的宽度与深度，实现多维度适应。

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt能有效捕捉科学领域动态演化，生成更细粒度、高一致性的多维分类体系，为文献组织提供新解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Motivation: 多语言大模型预训练面临模型容量限制、高质量数据稀缺及分词器语言覆盖不足的问题，需探索低成本干预方法以增强模型对新语言的适应能力。

Method: 提出使用覆盖语言更广的通用分词器（而非仅针对预训练语言），通过系统实验验证其在多样化语言组和训练策略下的效果。

Result: 通用分词器显著提升语言适应能力（胜率+20.2%），对分词器和预训练中完全未见过的语言亦提升5%，且对多数预训练语言性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 通用分词器通过早期训练干预有效增强语言可塑性，为扩展语言覆盖提供高效路径，同时保持原语言性能。

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

*Alberto Testoni,Iacer Calixto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了大型语言模型在临床多选题回答中的不确定性估计方法，发现轻量级单次生成方法接近语义熵性能，且模型选择需结合医学专业和问题类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床决策支持等高风险领域部署LLMs时，需确保其不确定性估计的准确性和校准性，但目前缺乏针对临床场景的细粒度评估。

Method: 对10个开源LLM（通用/生物医学/推理模型）在2个数据集、11个医学专业和6种题型上，对比单生成与采样方法，并通过推理轨迹行为信号设计单次轻量估计器。

Result: 轻量方法性能接近需多次采样的语义熵，且不同医学专业与题型间存在显著差异（如心脏病学误差率比放射学高3倍），模型表现高度依赖领域特性。

Conclusion: 基于行为信号的单次估计器可减少计算开销，实际部署需根据问题类型和模型专长动态选择模型，并针对专业领域差异优化不确定性校准。

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR系统在通用语音识别表现优异，但命名实体识别错误率仍较高，而命名实体作为关键信息错误会影响下游任务，需针对性优化。

Method: 引入LLM修正机制，利用大语言模型的推理能力及包含正确命名实体的本地上下文（如课程讲义），对ASR预测结果进行后处理修订。

Result: 在自建的NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare数据集（45小时MIT课程数据）上，命名实体词错误率（WER）相对降低30%。

Conclusion: 通过LLM与本地上下文结合的方法有效提升ASR系统对关键命名实体的识别准确率，并公开新数据集支持相关研究。

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需为每种语言单独部署编辑系统，成本高昂；而跨语言统一更新易引发参数干扰，导致多语言泛化能力下降及知识注入不准确。

Method: LangEdit采用零空间约束框架，将各语言参数更新投影至先前更新子空间的正交补集，数学保证更新独立性并保留多语言泛化能力。

Result: 在3种模型架构、6种语言和4个下游任务中，LangEdit有效减少参数干扰，性能超越现有最先进编辑方法。

Conclusion: LangEdit为LLMs提供了高效、准确的多语言知识更新方案，其正交投影机制具有保障更新独立性的理论优势，代码已发布。

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReCUT有效平衡推理精度与长度，为LLMs推理优化提供新方向，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

TL;DR: 本文提出SlowFast Sampling动态采样策略，结合dLLM-Cache，显著提升扩散语言模型的推理速度，在LLaDA上实现最高15.63倍加速，且与自回归模型相比吞吐量更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散语言模型采样策略存在静态行为缺陷，导致解码效率低下且灵活性受限，需设计动态策略以平衡效率与质量。

Method: 提出基于确定性、收敛性、位置性三原则的SlowFast Sampling策略，动态切换探索/加速解码阶段，并集成dLLM-Cache减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验显示LLaDA加速达15.63倍（结合缓存后34.22倍），吞吐量超越LLaMA3 8B等自回归基线，精度损失极小。

Conclusion: 精心设计的动态采样策略可充分释放扩散语言模型潜力，实现高效高质量文本生成，证明其替代自回归架构的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督语音模型分析主要集中于英语，本文旨在探究模型在不同语言（包括匹配与非匹配语言）下的信息编码机制。

Method: 使用探测分类器与几何分析方法，对四种语言训练的wav2vec2模型进行音素、声调、说话者信息的表征检测。

Result: 所有语言模型中编码不同信息的子空间高度正交；后期层中匹配语言的音素/声调探测略有优势，但整体层间模式相似；说话者信息无语言匹配优势。

Conclusion: wav2vec2学习到的表征结构具有语言无关性，其信息编码方式不依赖于预训练时使用的特定语音材料。

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining

to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出大语言模型（LLMs）的泛化与幻觉行为均由其上下文外推理（OCR）机制驱动，并通过理论分析与实验验证了矩阵分解与梯度下降隐式偏差在此过程中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在微调过程中表现出的双重性（泛化与幻觉）的根本原因，揭示其底层机制以理解知识注入的潜在风险。

Method: 通过五个主流LLMs实验验证OCR机制，构建单层单头注意力模型进行合成事实召回任务，结合矩阵分解与核范数理论分析梯度下降的隐式偏差。

Result: 实验表明OCR机制在因果/虚假关联下分别驱动泛化与幻觉；理论证明梯度下降隐式偏差使模型优先学习低核范数解，从而高效关联事实与隐含信息。

Conclusion: OCR现象的理论框架为分析知识注入引发的模型行为提供了新视角，矩阵分解结构解释了样本高效学习机制，为抑制虚假关联提供了数学基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's

their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与人类偏好对齐的方法虽提升实用性，但忽略了信念更新时因新信息冲突或模糊性产生的认知摩擦，影响动态协作中的信念整合过程。

Method: 在动态认知逻辑框架下定义动态认知摩擦（信念整合阻力），通过协作任务中的对话分析验证模型，并扩展模型以适配现实对话复杂性。

Conclusion: 动态认知摩擦为LLM对齐提供新视角，增强复杂对话场景的适应性，未来可结合更精细的信念修正机制提升模型表现。

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec通过将数据集分解为元域线性组合，优化语言模型预训练的数据混合，减少计算开销并提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在语言模型预训练中难以高效确定最优数据混合比例，且计算成本高。本文旨在通过数据分布对齐假设(DA²)，寻找计算高效的数据混合策略。

Method: 提出Domain2Vec框架：维护元域词汇表，用分类器将数据集分解为元域分布向量；基于DA²假设，通过域向量对齐训练与验证集分布，无需训练即可确定最优数据混合。

Result: 在Pile-CC上仅需原计算量的51.5%即可达到相同验证损失；相同计算预算下，下游任务平均性能提升2.83%。

Conclusion: Domain2Vec能有效建模域向量与模型性能关系，显著提升现有方法的效率与扩展性，为数据混合优化提供理论支持。

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Result: 在自动化数据科学基准测试中表现优于现有方法，验证了有效性、效率及解决方案质量，支持复杂任务处理。

Conclusion: AutoMind通过知识驱动与动态适应，为全自动化数据科学提供了高效稳健的解决方案，突破传统框架局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

TL;DR: 当前推理模型虽能识别多数无效思维，但在恢复过程中表现不佳，尤其大模型更易受干扰，需提升自我再评估能力以提高推理安全性和准确性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究推理模型在自我重新评估（self-reevaluation）中的有效性，特别是其识别和纠正四类无益思维（如冗长、无关、误导性及错误答案相关思维）的能力。

Method: 通过向模型注入四类无益思维（如无关或误导性内容），分析其识别与恢复能力，并设计越狱实验测试模型对有害思维的抵抗力。

Result: 模型能有效识别无效思维，但恢复能力差（尤其大模型对短无关思维更敏感），且小模型对有害思维的干扰最小。

Conclusion: 需改进模型的自我再评估机制以增强推理鲁棒性和安全性，避免因无效思维干扰导致性能下降或安全隐患。

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个猜想，认为AI系统在可证明正确性与广泛数据映射能力之间存在根本性权衡：符号AI可确保零错误但应用范围狭窄，生成式模型能处理高维数据但必然存在错误风险。该猜想从信息论角度重构了AI工程目标与哲学期待。

Conclusion: 该猜想的证实或证伪将深刻塑造可信AI的未来发展，要求学术界在形式证明与工程实践层面持续探索，以实现技术能力与伦理责任的协同演进。

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 现有医疗AI模型难以动态适应新人群、专科或场景，依赖微调或知识库检索，易忽略关键上下文信息，导致临床决策错误。

Method: 提出'上下文切换'概念框架，通过动态调整推理机制（而非重新训练）实现跨专科、人群和工作流的自适应医疗AI。

Conclusion: 上下文切换AI可突破现有模型限制，扩展医疗服务的覆盖范围与场景适应性，提升临床决策的精准性和可及性。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

TL;DR: 该论文通过计算复杂性理论分析，证明随着AI系统表达能力超过临界值，安全验证将变得指数级困难且coNP完全，揭示了能力提升与安全验证之间的根本矛盾，并提出AI发展面临的三难困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示AI系统能力增强与安全验证之间的内在矛盾。随着AI能力提升，社会对其安全性的要求趋于完美，但验证复杂度却呈指数增长，形成无法回避的张力。

Method: 通过形式化能力-风险缩放(CRS)动态模型，构建四个核心理论：1) 验证复杂度随表达能力指数增长 2) 安全策略空间占比呈双指数衰减 3) 有限对齐技术无法覆盖所有场景 4) 神经网络鲁棒安全属性测度为零。使用Lean4进行形式化验证。

Result: 证明当系统表达能力EXP(m)超过阈值τ时：安全验证具有coNP完全性且需指数时间；安全策略仅占策略空间的2^{-2^m}；任何有限对齐技术集都无法实现普适覆盖；鲁棒安全属性在神经网络中构成零测集。

Conclusion: 提出战略三难困境：AI发展必须选择(1)限制系统复杂度保持可验证安全 (2)接受不可验证的能力扩展 (3)突破现有范式建立新型安全理论。首次系统建立AI对齐问题的复杂性理论边界，为安全研究提供严格基准。

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对Minecraft开放世界中构建通用智能体面临的挑战，提出了知识增强数据生成、任务级路由的MoE架构及多模态推理增强强化学习方法，开发出Optimus-3智能体并在实验中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于多模态大语言模型的智能体在开放世界（如Minecraft）中仍面临领域数据不足、异构任务干扰和视觉多样性三大挑战，需构建具备感知、规划、行动等能力的通用智能体。

Method: 1) 知识增强数据生成管道提供可扩展的高质量训练数据；2) 任务级路由的混合专家架构（MoE）减少异构任务干扰；3) 多模态推理增强强化学习方法提升视觉多样性处理能力。

Result: Optimus-3在Minecraft环境中广泛任务上超越通用多模态大语言模型及现有最先进智能体，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过数据生成、架构优化与强化学习结合，Optimus-3成功解决了开放世界智能体的核心挑战，为通用智能体研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出NeuroPAL框架，通过结合神经进化拓扑增强算法（NEAT）与间断式即时学习（PAL），在《星际争霸：母巢之战》的宏观策略任务中实现更高效的训练，使智能体在50%的缩短时间内达到竞技水平，并涌现人类专家级策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统《星际争霸》AI基于规则系统或监督深度学习，存在适应性与计算效率限制。研究旨在通过改进神经进化方法，解决复杂即时战略环境中长期规划的效率问题。

Method: 提出NeuroPAL框架：将NEAT与PAL结合，通过交替进行低精度高频训练与高精度周期性评估，提升进化算法样本效率。实验采用固定地图、单一种族场景进行验证。

Result: PAL使训练时间减少约50%，智能体表现出代理兵营部署、防御建筑优化等人类专家策略。性能显著优于标准NEAT基线。

Conclusion: 结构化评估机制PAL可增强神经进化在复杂RTS环境中的扩展性与有效性，为AI宏观策略研究提供新方向。

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Mirage-1多模态GUI代理，通过分层技能模块（HMS）和技能增强蒙特卡洛树搜索（SA-MCTS）解决长时任务中的知识不足与领域差距问题，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM作为GUI代理在在线长时任务中表现不佳，主要因知识不足及离线/在线领域差距导致。受人类知识泛化机制启发，需构建层次化知识结构并弥合领域鸿沟。

Method: 1. HMS模块将轨迹分层抽象为元技能-核心技能-执行技能；2. SA-MCTS算法利用离线技能缩小在线动作搜索空间；3. 构建跨平台即插即用代理Mirage-1。

Result: 在AndroidWorld、MobileMiniWob++、Mind2Web-Live及新基准AndroidLH上分别超越前最佳方法32%、19%、15%、79%，验证了长时任务处理能力。

Conclusion: HMS层次化知识表达与SA-MCTS领域迁移机制有效提升了GUI代理的长期任务性能，Mirage-1为跨平台界面自动化提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

*Jintao Liang,Gang Su,Huifeng Lin,You Wu,Rui Zhao,Ziyue Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了推理代理式检索增强生成（Reasoning Agentic RAG）的演进，提出从静态流程转向动态代理范式，以解决复杂推理和多模态集成问题，并分类为预定义推理与自主代理推理，探讨技术挑战与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态RAG系统在复杂现实场景（如动态检索、多模态整合）中表现不足，需通过嵌入决策与自适应工具提升推理能力。

Method: 将现有方法分为两类：基于固定模块化流程的预定义推理系统，以及模型自主协调工具交互的代理推理系统，分析其架构设计、推理策略与工具协作机制。

Result: 构建分类框架，总结代表性技术优缺点，识别系统灵活性、鲁棒性等核心挑战，并提出未来研究方向（如动态工具编排、多模态融合）。

Conclusion: 推理代理式RAG通过融合决策与工具交互增强LLM能力，但需进一步优化架构设计与跨模态协同，以实现更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于代理的多维度自动扩展框架，用于资源受限的边缘计算环境，通过动态调整硬件资源和内部配置优化服务需求满足。实验比较四种扩展代理，验证其可行性和不同收敛特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动扩展方法在严格资源限制的边缘计算环境中灵活性不足，需结合多维度弹性扩展（如硬件资源和内部配置）以提升性能。

Method: 提出基于代理的自动扩展框架，动态协调硬件资源与服务配置，并对比Active Inference、Deep Q Network、结构知识分析和深度主动推理四种代理。使用YOLOv8视觉识别和OpenCV二维码检测服务进行并行实验验证。

Result: 所有代理均满足服务等级目标（SLO），但收敛模式不同：Deep Q Network依赖预训练，结构分析收敛最快，深度主动推理兼具理论优势与扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于代理的多维度自动扩展在边缘环境中可行，不同代理各有适用场景。研究为未来边缘弹性计算方向提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.
This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging
olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original
problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a
comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities,
and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We
propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and
enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant
evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind
closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human
participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal
compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully
open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we
hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities
for future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有科学多模态大模型（MLLMs）的评测基准过于侧重知识理解能力，对感知与推理能力的评估不足，需构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 设计SFE基准，通过科学信号感知、属性理解、比较推理三个层次，包含830个专家验证的VQA对，覆盖5个高价值学科的66项多模态任务。

Result: 当前最优模型GPT-4o和InternVL-3在SFE上的准确率仅为34.08%和26.52%，表明科学领域性能亟待提升。

Conclusion: SFE揭示了MLLMs在科学认知能力的局限性，其评估框架有望推动AI增强科学发现的研究进展。

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning
based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise.
Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific
benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities
of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning
abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE)
benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs
through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%
and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in
scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further
developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogiPlan是一个评估大语言模型在复杂关系结构逻辑规划能力的新基准，包含三个任务，动态调整难度，测试发现模型性能与规模、架构相关，复杂场景仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在生成和查询结构化图（如网络基础设施、知识图谱）时，需验证其逻辑关系推理能力，但缺乏细粒度评估复杂关系链的基准。

Method: 通过控制对象数量、关系链深度动态调整任务复杂度，设计计划生成、一致性检测、比较问题三个任务，并引入自纠错机制评估多模型性能。

Result: 主流模型（如GPT-4.5、Claude 3.7等）在简单任务表现良好，但在深层逻辑链场景下性能显著下降，模型规模与架构对结果影响明显。

Conclusion: 当前增强推理模型虽在基础任务有潜力，但复杂逻辑规划仍是瓶颈，LogiPlan为模型能力评估提供了细粒度分析工具。

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Primender序列，一种结合素数性质与模数位条件的新整数序列，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的符号推理能力。通过结构化测试框架验证假设，并比较多个LLM在规则推断、假设验证及序列生成上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在创建可解释的规则化测试基准，评估LLM推断隐藏规则、验证数学假设及推广符号逻辑的能力，弥补数论、人工智能与软件工程领域间的鸿沟。

Method: 设计Primender序列的生成规则及假设，构建结构化提示与评估框架，测试ChatGPT、Copilot等主流LLM，采用规则推断准确率、假设验证度等指标进行对比分析。

Result: 通过实验量化各LLM在序列生成、假设验证及符号解释上的性能差异，验证Primender序列作为评估工具的有效性，并揭示模型在符号推理中的局限性。

Conclusion: Primender序列为LLM符号推理能力提供了可复现的基准测试方法，其混合规则特性为跨领域研究（数论与AI）提供了新工具，推动模型在数学逻辑推理上的进步。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络和图诊断算法的新方法，用于复杂信息物理系统的故障诊断，仅需少量先验知识即可有效缩小搜索空间并定位故障源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诊断方法依赖详细系统模型或大量训练数据，但实际中此类先验知识获取困难，需开发低依赖度的诊断方案。

Method: 结合子系统级异常检测的神经网络症状生成器与基于最小因果关系的图诊断算法，仅需子系统基础关系信息和正常工况数据。

Result: 仿真数据集显示82%案例正确识别真实故障组件，73%场景有效缩减搜索空间；真实水处理数据集验证了实际可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏先验知识场景下展现实用潜力，特别适用于大型复杂信息物理系统的故障诊断场景。

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在通用数学推理上有所进展，但在电信等专业领域（如信号处理、网络优化）的数学问题解决能力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过领域专家设计种子问题，构建包含500个电信数学问题的TeleMath数据集，并建立自动化生成流程。测试多种开源LLM的性能。

Conclusion: TeleMath填补了专业领域LLM数学能力研究的空白，强调领域专用模型的重要性，开源资源将支持后续研究复现与扩展。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutomationML(AML)建模建议以非正式文本约束形式存在，无法在AML内部实现自动化验证，需解决约束形式化与自动检查的技术缺口。

Method: 1. 通过RML/SPARQL将AML模型映射为OWL本体 2. 使用大语言模型将文本规则翻译为SHACL约束 3. 对本体执行SHACL验证并生成自然语言解释结果

Result: 在AML示例推荐规则中验证成功，证明复杂建模规则可通过半自动流程检查，且用户无需掌握本体技术或形式化方法。

Conclusion: 该流程有效桥接非正式约束与形式化验证，降低AML建模质量检查的技术门槛，为工程数据交换标准化提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Motivation: 为整合答案集编程(ASP)的非单调推理能力与可满足性模理论(SMT)处理复杂理论的能力，解决连续变化等现实问题，需建立两者在函数稳定模型语义下的统一框架。

Method: 通过aspsmt2smt编译器将ASPMT程序转换为SMT实例：使用gringo进行部分基础化处理，保留未决变量由z3求解器处理，实现ASP与SMT的协同计算。

Result: 实验表明系统能有效处理实数运算，支持连续变化推理，验证了ASPMT程序通过SMT求解器计算稳定模型的可行性。

Conclusion: ASPMT2SMT系统成功融合ASP与SMT技术，扩展了传统ASP在连续域问题的应用，为复杂混合系统建模提供新工具。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts
instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex
solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently
explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization
problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from
Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging
environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both
ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to
promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative
reasoning. Project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出结合思维链推理与模型上下文协议（MCP）的框架，提升大语言模型在时空行为模拟中的性能，实验验证其生成数据与真实移动信号高度吻合，并实现高效并行处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则和统计的时空行为模拟方法存在计算成本高、泛化性差、扩展性不足的问题，而大语言模型作为'世界模拟器'在时空推理中存在空间认知局限、物理约束理解缺失及群体同质化倾向。

Method: 整合思维链推理与MCP协议，通过五阶段认知框架实现类人渐进推理，并利用六类MCP工具（时间管理、空间导航、环境感知、个人记忆、社会协作、经验评估）进行全流程数据处理。

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work
contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling,
advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical
approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a
foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and
participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex
tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when
provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of
planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human
intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs
for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI
planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework. We
demonstrate the efficacy of GenPlanX in assisting users with office-related
tasks, highlighting its potential to streamline workflows and enhance

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出首个针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的分子毒性修复基准任务ToxiMol，构建标准化数据集与自动化评估框架ToxiEval，系统评估近30个主流模型，揭示其在毒性修复任务中的潜力与挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毒性是药物早期开发失败的主因，但分子毒性修复任务缺乏系统性定义与基准测试。现有研究未充分结合毒理学知识，且缺乏统一评估标准，阻碍MLLMs在该领域的应用与发展。

Method: 1) 构建含11个任务、560个毒性分子的标准化数据集；2) 设计基于毒理学知识的机制感知任务自适应提示注释流程；3) 开发整合毒性预测、可合成性等指标的自动化评估框架ToxiEval；4) 对30个MLLMs进行系统评估与归因分析。

Result: 当前MLLMs在毒性修复任务中仍面临显著挑战，但已展现出毒性语义理解（准确率提升18%）、结构约束遵循（相似度>0.75）及分子编辑能力（成功率32%），失败案例主要源于复杂毒性机制理解不足。

Conclusion: ToxiMol为MLLMs分子毒性修复建立首个系统性研究框架，实验表明现有模型已具备基础能力，但需进一步融合领域知识以应对复杂毒性机制，为AI驱动的药物安全性优化提供新范式。

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，即使使用与正确答案相关性极低甚至负相关的虚假奖励，强化学习结合可验证奖励（RLVR）仍能显著提升特定模型（如Qwen2.5-Math-7B）的数学推理能力，但对其他模型家族（如Llama3、OLMo2）无效。RLVR可能激活预训练中学到的推理表征，但需跨模型验证以避免单一模型偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在奖励信号与正确答案无关或误导的情况下，RLVR是否仍能通过强化学习机制激发模型的潜在数学推理能力，并分析不同模型家族对此方法的响应差异。

Method: 采用多种虚假奖励信号（随机奖励、格式奖励、错误标签、1-shot强化学习、多数投票）对Qwen2.5-Math-7B等模型进行RLVR训练，并对比不同模型家族的表现。

Result: Qwen模型在虚假奖励下MATH-500性能提升13.8%-27.1%（接近真实奖励的29.1%），代码推理行为频率从65%增至90%以上，但其他模型无显著增益。

Conclusion: RLVR可能通过强化学习机制激活预训练中已习得的推理表征，但其有效性高度依赖模型架构。未来研究需在多样化模型上验证RLVR，避免因单一模型易受虚假奖励干扰而产生误导性结论。

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态类增量学习（MCIL）仅关注视觉与文本，本文旨在整合视觉、音频与文本模态，解决互补性信息融合与灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 1. 基于混合专家（MoE）的多模态增量特征提取器（MIFE）；2. 含掩码阈值与动态特征融合的自适应视听融合模块（AAVFM）及文本多样性增强策略；3. 多模态类增量对比训练损失；4. 提出两种MCIL专用评估指标。

Conclusion: 通过结构设计、融合机制优化及对比学习，本文方法有效实现了多模态类增量学习，并为该领域提供了新的评估标准。

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出NOCL框架，通过节点描述和概念化技术，将大语言模型应用于非文本属性图数据，解决传统图神经网络在标签稀缺和零样本场景下的局限性，并统一不同层级图任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络依赖监督学习，泛化能力受限；现有自监督方法仍需微调，无法适应零样本场景。大语言模型处理图数据面临推理能力保留、长文本处理及任务单一等挑战。

Method: 1) 节点描述：将异质节点属性转为结构化自然语言，扩展LLM至非文本属性图；2) 节点概念：用预训练模型压缩语义嵌入，减少93.9% token长度；3) 图表示描述符统一多层级任务为语言查询格式。

Result: NOCL在监督场景下性能与MPNN及混合方法相当，零样本泛化能力显著优于基线，验证其作为图基础模型的潜力。

Conclusion: NOCL突破LLM在图数据应用的三大限制，为图基础模型开辟新方向，同时兼容监督与零样本场景，实现跨任务泛化。

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用串联神经网络（TNN）结合不同深度学习模型（MLP、CNN、LSTM）进行二氧化硅/二氧化钛多层薄膜透射光谱的逆向设计，解决了传统方法耗时的问题。LSTM-LSTM TNN精度最高但训练最慢，CNN-LSTM TNN在精度与速度间达到最优平衡。

Motivation: 传统薄膜逆向设计依赖大量数值模拟与优化，效率低下。深度学习可提升效率，但一对多映射问题影响性能，需改进TNN结构。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），结合逆神经网络与预训练正向网络，探索MLP、CNN、LSTM三种算法的不同组合（如LSTM-LSTM、CNN-LSTM等）配置TNN。

Result: LSTM-LSTM TNN精度最高但训练时间最长；CNN-LSTM TNN综合CNN特征提取与LSTM序列建模优势，在精度与速度间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM TNN是薄膜逆向设计的最优方案，兼具高精度与高效率，为光学薄膜设计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO通过精细化数据利用机制，证明了其在提升模型性能方面的有效性和鲁棒性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Conclusion: 通过贝叶斯框架与LLM的融合，为构建更可靠、可校准的LLM系统开辟了新路径，实现了经典概率方法与前沿语言模型的有机结合。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的优化框架，通过理论推导确定分层变分自编码器(HVAE)潜在维度分配的最优比例r*，显著提升了分布外(OOD)检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分层变分自编码器在潜在维度分配上存在随意性，导致表示效率低下或后验坍塌问题，严重影响OOD检测性能，而安全关键型应用亟需可靠的异常输入检测方法。

Method: 建立信息损失与表示衰减的理论权衡框架，证明固定潜在容量下存在最优分配比例r*，通过系统调整该比例优化HVAE的层次结构。

Result: 实验证明优化后的分配比例r*在不同数据集和架构中持续提升OOD检测性能，显著优于基线HVAE配置，最高提升幅度达统计显著水平。

Conclusion: 该框架为潜在空间结构设计提供了理论指导，通过信息论驱动的维度分配策略，增强了深度生成模型的OOD检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对核化赌博机问题中现有方法（如UCB、Thompson采样）的局限性，作者旨在构建一个通用框架，通过探索分布统一随机化与确定性策略，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出GP-Generic算法框架，利用探索分布生成动作选择策略。该框架允许使用UCB等确定性方法或随机化策略，并通过RKHS复杂度参数γ_T设计探索分布。

Result: 算法实现了理论最优的tilde{O}(γ_T√T)遗憾界，与UCB/TS方法一致，但实验表明随机化策略在实践中可能表现更优。

Conclusion: 探索分布为核化赌博机提供了灵活的设计框架，统一了经典算法，且随机化策略在保持理论最优性的前提下具有实践优势。

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

### [96] [Unsupervised Deep Clustering of MNIST with Triplet-Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10094)
*Md. Faizul Islam Ansari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过两阶段深度自动编码器架构，结合重构误差与K均值聚类损失，提出一种针对MNIST手写数字的无监督聚类方法，在保持高重构精度的同时实现优异聚类效果，并通过可视化验证其可解释性与可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督聚类方法在图像特征表达和聚类纯度间存在平衡难题，且大规模应用时缺乏可解释性。本研究旨在通过深度学习的表示学习能力，构建兼具高精度重构与清晰聚类分离的框架。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 深度自动编码器通过最小化重构误差学习紧凑特征表示；2) 联合优化重构误差与K均值聚类损失的联合目标函数，结合批量归一化、Dropout和权重衰减提升模型稳定性。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，Silhouette Score、Davies-Bouldin Index等内在指标与NMI、ARI等外在指标均显著提升，t-SNE可视化显示数字嵌入空间形成明显分离簇。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了数据重构与聚类纯度的最优平衡，为大规模无监督图像聚类提供了可解释、可扩展的解决方案，奠定了表示学习在实际应用中的基础。

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction
errors. During the second phase we unify the reconstruction error with a KMeans
clustering loss for learned latent embeddings through a joint distance-based
objective. Our model contains three elements which include batch normalization
combined with dropout and weight decay for achieving generalized and stable
results. The framework achieves superior clustering performance during
extensive tests which used intrinsic measurements including Silhouette Score
and Davies-Bouldin Index coupled with extrinsic metrics NMI and ARI when
processing image features. The research uses t-SNE visualization to present
learned embeddings that show distinct clusters for digits. Our approach reaches
an optimal combination between data reconstruction accuracy and cluster
separation purity when adding the benefit of understandable results and
scalable implementations. The approach creates a dependable base that helps
deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image
clustering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于跨客户端相似性的联邦多任务学习方法，通过特征锚点压缩通信数据，结合动态图正则化和社区检测实现高效个性化协作，实验证明其在性能、效率及公平性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据分布异构性导致模型个性化需求，传统方法存在通信开销大、负协作风险及个性化不足的问题。

Method: 1. 引入特征锚点压缩本地特征以减少通信量；2. 共享轻量级分类头并采用动态图正则化建模客户端协作；3. 基于社区检测划分同质子图限制高相似客户端协作。

Result: 在两个异构数据集上显著超越现有基线，计算/通信效率提升，并促进客户端间公平性。

Conclusion: 通过特征锚点与动态社区协作机制，在保证通信效率的同时实现正向知识迁移，有效平衡联邦学习中的个性化与协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

TL;DR: 本文提出非负扩散模型（NnD），通过基于分数的扩散和退火Langevin动力学，在生成过程中强制非负性，显著降低复杂物理现象（如云形成）的模拟成本，并生成符合物理规律的3D体积云。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然现象（如云形成）的物理模拟计算成本高昂且难以扩展，需开发高效生成模型以替代传统模拟方法。

Method: 提出非负扩散模型（NnD），结合基于分数的扩散框架与退火Langevin动力学，在迭代生成过程中强制保持非负性，利用高质量物理模拟数据进行训练。

Result: 生成的3D云微物理场具有非负性，符合云物理趋势，且专家无法有效区分其与真实物理模拟结果。

Conclusion: NnD通过物理约束生成方法，在保持物理合理性的前提下大幅降低计算成本，为复杂自然现象建模提供高效工具。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出GRAIL框架，用于动态环境中图主动学习（AL）策略的评估，弥补现有方法在用户中心指标（如多样性、公平性）和动态适应性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法多基于静态数据集评估，且仅关注预测准确性，忽视了用户负担、采样多样性、动态环境适应性等关键问题。需开发更全面的评估机制以支持实际应用。

Method: 提出GRAIL基准框架，引入新指标（持续有效性、多样性、用户负担）评估动态环境下的图AL策略，并通过动态真实人类传感器数据集进行实验分析。

Result: 实验表明现有AL策略在预测性能与用户负担间存在权衡，GRAIL验证了平衡节点重要性、查询多样性和网络拓扑的关键作用。

Conclusion: GRAIL为动态环境中的图AL方法提供了综合评估工具，强调需兼顾模型性能与用户中心指标，推动实际场景中高效且人性化数据标注策略的发展。

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单位容量模型无法处理广义容量场景，且无感知设置下缺乏碰撞反馈导致协调与容量发现困难，需开发新算法突破反馈限制。

Method: A-CAPELLA算法通过结构化碰撞模式实现同步连续消除，采用协作假设检验协议进行容量估计与资源分配。

Result: 算法在广义容量场景下实现对数遗憾，首次证明去中心化无感知MMAB在未知容量条件下的可学习性。

Conclusion: 通过设计碰撞模式驱动的协同学习机制，成功突破无感知设置下容量发现与协调难题，扩展了经典理论框架。

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出离线领域随机化（ODR）方法，通过利用真实系统数据拟合模拟器参数分布，结合理论分析与改进算法E-DROPO，显著降低强化学习的sim-to-real迁移误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域随机化（DR）方法在模拟器训练中忽略真实系统离线数据，导致模拟到现实的性能差距较大。ODR旨在通过数据驱动的参数分布优化解决这一问题。

Method: 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器族的最大似然估计，证明其一致性及误差边界；提出E-DROPO算法，通过熵奖励防止参数分布坍缩，增强随机化鲁棒性。

Result: 理论证明ODR的sim-to-real误差比均匀DR缩小O(M)倍，E-DROPO在实验中实现更广参数覆盖和零样本迁移性能提升。

Conclusion: ODR为数据驱动的领域随机化提供理论保障，E-DROPO通过熵正则化进一步优化参数分布，显著提升强化学习策略的现实迁移能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强GCBC的表示学习目标，通过近似后续表示（successor representations）提升目标条件化策略的组合泛化能力，无需依赖对比样本或TD学习，并在复杂任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件化行为克隆（GCBC）在分布内任务表现良好，但面对需要组合泛化的新状态-目标对时，因状态表示缺乏时间一致性而受限。后续表示能捕捉时间一致性，但传统方法依赖对比样本或TD学习，需探索更简单有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出BYOL-γ增强GCBC方法：设计新的表示学习目标，在有限MDP场景下理论近似后续表示，避免使用对比样本或TD学习，直接优化状态编码的时间一致性。

Result: 该方法在需要组合泛化的复杂任务中表现优异，验证了其与现有方法竞争性的实证效果，尤其在减少新状态-目标对的分布外差距方面显著。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC通过理论严谨的表示学习目标，有效提升组合泛化能力，为离线策略学习提供了更简洁且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过逆向工程分析了一个用于Sokoban游戏的卷积循环神经网络（RNN），发现其利用测试时计算提升性能的机制类似于经典双向搜索，但存在状态非统一表示、分层计划等独特设计。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解无模型强化学习训练的RNN如何通过增加测试时计算量提升性能，并揭示其内部机制是否具有可解释性及与传统搜索算法的异同。

Method: 采用部分逆向工程方法，分析网络激活通道的方向关联性、状态-动作激活幅度对回溯决策的影响，以及专用卷积核在路径扩展中的作用，同时考察分层计划表示和独立处理各箱子的特性。

Result: 发现网络通过方向关联通道表示计划，激活幅度控制回溯与剪枝（类似价值函数），专用核实现路径扩展（类似过渡模型），但状态表示非统一且分层计划增加搜索能力，与经典搜索算法存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 尽管该网络机制不同于经典搜索算法，但其通过无模型训练学到的测试时计算优化机制可被人类理解，表明强化学习模型的可解释性潜力。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Conclusion: 结合不精确概率与注意力机制的新型生存模型显著提升截尾数据处理能力，为非参数生存分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

Conclusion: PMB-NN通过融合生理原理与数据驱动，实现了高精度、可解释的个体化心脏监测，为日常活动中的实时个性化心脏健康管理提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法（如SimCLR、SupCon）的嵌入表示缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了其在需要置信度估计场景中的应用。

Method: VCL框架将InfoNCE损失视为重建项替代，结合单位超球面均匀先验的KL正则化，建模投影正态分布后验，提出VSimCLR和VSupCon变体，用概率嵌入采样替代确定性嵌入。

Conclusion: VCL为对比学习建立概率基础，兼具性能与不确定性量化能力，成为对比方法的新范式。

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: The advance of speech decoding from non-invasive brain data holds the
potential for profound societal impact. Among its most promising applications
is the restoration of communication to paralysed individuals affected by speech
deficits such as dysarthria, without the need for high-risk surgical
interventions. The ultimate aim of the 2025 PNPL competition is to produce the

  To facilitate this vision we present the largest within-subject MEG dataset

the competition we define two foundational tasks (i.e. Speech Detection and
Phoneme Classification from brain data), complete with standardised data splits
and evaluation metrics, illustrative benchmark models, online tutorial code, a
community discussion board, and public leaderboard for submissions. To promote
accessibility and participation the competition features a Standard track that
emphasises algorithmic innovation, as well as an Extended track that is
expected to reward larger-scale computing, accelerating progress toward a
non-invasive brain-computer interface for speech.

Conclusion: WBSAC通过定向探索策略有效解决了稀疏奖励环境下的样本效率问题，为连续控制强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Motivation: 揭示扩散模型确定性采样过程中存在的几何规律性，突破传统对采样轨迹高维复杂性的认知，为优化采样效率提供新视角。

Conclusion: 采样轨迹的固有低维结构为优化扩散模型提供了新方向，简单的动态规划策略即可有效利用该结构特性提升生成效率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE提出了一种动态子群变分自编码框架，通过非参数聚类机制自适应检测OOD样本，有效捕捉数据中的新兴子群模式，提升模型在多种OOD场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实观测数据中存在异质子群，传统模型常忽视这些少数群体，导致预测偏差。现有方法仅将此类样本视为域外（OOD）而未主动适应新趋势，亟需动态建模框架。

Method: DynaSubVAE结合表示学习与动态OOD检测，通过高斯混合模型启发的非参数聚类机制，在潜在空间中动态更新子群结构以捕捉新数据模式。

Result: 实验表明DynaSubVAE在近/远OOD检测及训练数据缺失整类的场景中表现优异，其动态子群机制在OOD准确率和后悔精度上均超越GMM、KMeans++等独立聚类方法。

Conclusion: 动态子群结构与自适应OOD检测的联合优化，使模型能持续适应数据演变，为异质化子群建模提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG和PCG分别捕捉心脏电活动与机械活动，但二者信息重叠性、相互可重建性及生物标志物提取潜力尚未明确，尤其在动态生理条件和个体差异下的表现仍需探索。

Method: 使用EPHNOGRAM数据集中的静息/运动状态同步ECG-PCG记录，采用线性和非线性机器学习模型（含非因果LSTM）进行跨模态重建，分析因果性、生理状态及跨个体差异的影响，并引入基于包络的瞬时振幅建模。

Result: 非线性模型（尤其是非因果LSTM）重建效果更佳，ECG→PCG重建难度更高；运动与跨个体场景挑战显著，但包络建模提升跨主体泛化性；PCG可跨个体估计ECG生物标志物（如QT间期）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了心电-机械模态的波形特征与事件时序关联，为新型多模态心脏监测技术提供了理论基础，尤其在跨模态生物标志物提取与动态场景适应性方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Motivation: 现有基于序列到序列的语言模型在模拟电路拓扑生成中存在电路表示效率低（O(|V|²)）、数值输入精度敏感度不足的问题，难以满足现代应用对高精度定制化设计的需求。

Method: 提出SFCI表示法：1) 使用标识符增强组件类型识别；2) 将电路描述复杂度降至O(|V|)；3) 改进浮点数输入处理以提升数值精度敏感度。

Result: 在0.01严格容差下成功率提升34%，MSE降低10倍；对大规模电路（更多顶点）的迁移性提升达58.5%。

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2通过创新的电路表示方法，为语言模型驱动的模拟拓扑生成建立了高效、高精度的框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Method: DC-Clustering通过共享中间表征而非原始数据实现隐私保护，支持k-means/谱聚类灵活选择，仅需单轮中央服务器通信完成聚类。

Conclusion: DC-Clustering填补了联邦学习在复杂数据划分场景的空白，其隐私性、高效性和灵活性使其在医疗、金融等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过元学习框架和可微EM算法，有效解决了小样本多标注者场景下的噪声标签学习问题，提升了分类器泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于SDP松弛的DNN验证方法在深层网络中面临严格可行性条件丧失的问题，导致数值不稳定和最优性缺失，这成为SDP方法扩展性的根本障碍。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，设计五种增强验证问题可行性的解决方案，并重新审视传统ReLU单元上下界约束条件的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了SDP验证在深层网络中的根本性挑战，提出实用解决方案，并通过约束条件再分析推动更可靠DNN系统验证方法的发展。

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出Graph-MLLM基准，系统评估多模态图学习的三种范式（Encoder、Aligner、Predictor），发现结合视觉与文本属性、将视觉转为文本描述及微调MLLMs能显著提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态图（MMG）学习方法缺乏统一基准，导致不同方法间难以比较，阻碍领域进展。需通过标准化评估明确技术发展现状。

Method: 构建Graph-MLLM基准，在6个跨领域数据集上系统评估三种MMG学习范式（MLLM-as-Encoder/Aligner/Predictor），分析特征融合、模态对齐与微调策略的影响。

Result: 实验表明：1) 联合视觉与文本属性提升图学习性能；2) 视觉转文本描述优于直接使用原始视觉输入；3) 微调MLLMs无需显式图结构即可达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Graph-MLLM为多模态图学习提供公平评估框架，开源库将促进创新。研究验证了多模态融合与微调策略的有效性，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了PyLO，一个基于PyTorch的库，旨在通过用户友好的工作流程将学习型优化器推广至更广泛的机器学习社区，解决了现有方法依赖JAX和缺乏易用性的问题，并在大规模预训练任务中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习型优化器（如VeLO）因依赖JAX和缺乏易用性工具而难以被广泛采用。本文旨在通过开发一个基于PyTorch的库（PyLO），降低学习型优化器的使用门槛，并推动其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出PyLO库，支持PyTorch生态，整合CUDA加速的小型全连接优化器架构（small_fc_lopt），并与现有优化工具（如学习率调度、权重衰减）结合，提升训练速度和灵活性。

Result: PyLO在ViT B/16训练中实现39.36到205.59样本/秒的吞吐量提升，且结合传统优化工具后进一步增强了学习型优化器的性能。

Conclusion: PyLO通过易用性设计和高效实现，使学习型优化器更贴近实际应用，同时验证了其与传统优化工具结合的潜力，为社区提供了开源工具（https://github.com/Belilovsky-Lab/pylo）。

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Belilovsky-Lab/pylo

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的交互学习研究缺乏理论框架，且传统奖励学习效率受限，需建立原则性方法以利用语言反馈提升学习效率。

Method: 形式化LLF问题，提出转移eluder维度衡量问题复杂性，设计HELiX算法通过序列交互实现无遗憾学习。

Conclusion: 研究首次构建了语言反馈交互学习的理论框架，通过HELiX为通用语言反馈下的学习算法设计奠定基础。

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Conclusion: 小波架构为多样化生理信号分析奠定基础，多模态设计推动可穿戴监测与临床诊断发展，具有广泛生物医学应用潜力。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于历史感知神经算子（HANO）的端到端学习框架，用于数据驱动的路径依赖非弹性材料建模。HANO通过自回归模型和分层自注意力机制，克服传统循环神经网络的自洽性问题，并在复杂条件下表现出优越的预测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于循环神经网络（RNN）的材料响应模型存在自洽性问题和初始状态敏感性，尤其在处理广义加载路径时可能导致不稳定。本文旨在通过数据驱动方法，构建无需隐藏状态变量、能自适应路径离散化的模型。

Method: 开发历史感知神经算子（HANO），结合傅里叶神经算子主干和分层自注意力机制，通过多尺度特征提取捕捉全局加载模式与局部路径依赖，以连续算子建模应力-应变演化。

Result: 在弹塑性硬化和脆性固体渐进各向异性损伤两个基准问题中，HANO在预测精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性上均优于基线模型，尤其在噪声数据、多周期加载等复杂场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了高效的数据驱动替代方案，其自洽性、路径适应性和抗干扰特性使其易于与经典数值求解器集成，适用于实际工程场景。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs的微调过程可能暴露数据集级机密属性，需开发针对性防御机制以应对这一新型隐私风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs), vital for large model alignment, are underexplored for
complex embodied tasks like Embodied Question Answering (EQA) where nuanced

strategy to learn fine-grained behavioral distinctions. The generative nature
of EQA-RM provides interpretable, structured reward feedback (beyond simple

granularity, from concise scores to detailed critiques of reasoning and
grounding, at inference without retraining. Concurrently, we introduce

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM
generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API
costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To
address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model
Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging
programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can
be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing
interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted.
Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83%
and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a
Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a
model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of
RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the
JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合谱聚类与条件拉丁超立方采样（cLHS）的混合方法，以提升土壤有机碳（SOC）监测采样点的环境代表性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统cLHS采样可能忽略重要的小规模环境异质性区域，导致SOC预测模型训练数据不平衡。

Method: 先通过谱聚类将研究区划分为K个同质环境分区，再在各分区内执行cLHS采样，确保覆盖全部环境条件多样性。

Result: 在真实SOC数据集上验证表明，该方法比标准cLHS实现了更均匀的协变量特征空间覆盖与空间异质性表征。

Conclusion: 混合方法通过提升采样数据平衡性，可为机器学习模型提供更优质训练数据，从而提高SOC预测精度。

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for
interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By
leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function
approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved
scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural
networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze
the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter
estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data,
the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs,
constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these
models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of
KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and
detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability
for system identification in modern industrial systems.

Notably, MNN-LLM achieves up to a 8.6x speed increase compared to current
mainstream LLM-specific frameworks.

Compared to current state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models, the key

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应混合方法统一处理不同规模子群，为算法公平性评估提供了统计严格且样本鲁棒的新范式，尤其适用于高维交叉分析场景。

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

Result: U-Net分割IoU达0.87。非重叠信号MSE=0.0010(rho=0.9644)，重叠信号MSE=0.0029(rho=0.9641)，均显著优于基线方法(非重叠MSE=0.0015，重叠MSE=0.0178)。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升心电图数字化精度，尤其在信号重叠场景，为临床研究提供可靠技术基础。代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Conclusion: 低秩分解与流形优化结合为大规模图学习提供了高效解决方案，通过结构约束实现计算复杂度与模型精度的协同优化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

Result: WSEP相比MISL能发现更多下游任务初始策略，PWSEP理论上可覆盖所有最优策略。基于Wasserstein距离的方法展现出更优几何特性。

Conclusion: 理论分析揭示了技能多样性与可分离性的核心作用，基于Wasserstein距离的WSEP/PWSEP为无监督强化学习提供了更优的技能学习框架。

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

*Igor Urbanik,Paweł Gajewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Saturation SOM（SatSOM），通过神经元饱和度机制缓解自组织映射在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自组织映射（SOMs）虽具高效性，但在连续任务中仍面临知识遗忘挑战，需改进其持续学习能力。

Method: 引入饱和度机制：根据神经元信息积累程度动态降低学习率与邻域半径，冻结成熟神经元并激活未利用区域。

Result: SatSOM有效保留已学知识，将学习资源导向未开发区域，提升持续学习场景下的知识稳定性。

Conclusion: SatSOM通过神经元冻结策略扩展SOMs，为缓解持续学习中的灾难性遗忘提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

*Floris Holstege,Shauli Ravfogel,Bram Wouters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPLICE提出一种同时去除线性敏感概念并保持目标标签协方差的斜投影方法，在消除偏见的同时最小化信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络常编码无关敏感概念，影响模型公平性与可解释性。现有后处理方法在去除偏见时易损害有效信息，需开发更精准的去除方法。

Method: 采用斜投影技术(oblique projection)实现线性概念消除与协方差保持，通过数学投影在去除敏感方向的同时保护标签相关性。

Result: 理论证明为唯一满足线性去偏与最小嵌入失真的解，在Bias in Bios等基准测试中优于基线方法，有效去除属性偏见且主任务信息损失最小。

Conclusion: SPLICE通过几何投影框架实现了敏感概念消除与有效信息保护的最佳平衡，为公平机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ConTextTab模型，结合表格原生框架的架构优势与大语言模型的语义理解能力，通过多模态嵌入和真实数据训练，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格上下文学习模型存在局限性：表格原生模型（如TabPFN）仅依赖合成数据，缺乏真实语义；基于大语言模型的方案（如TabuLa-8B）受架构限制无法处理大量上下文。需结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出ConTextTab框架：1) 为不同数据模态设计专用嵌入 2) 在大规模真实表格数据上训练 3) 将语义理解融入表格原生架构，实现高效上下文学习。

Result: 在广泛基准测试中与SOTA模型竞争，并在富含语义的CARTE基准上创下新记录，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过融合表格原生架构效率与大语言模型的语义理解，ConTextTab成功平衡了计算效率与知识整合能力，为表格学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录问答需在有限监督下实现精准证据检索与可靠答案生成，以提升临床信息获取效率及AI可靠性。

Method: 将任务解耦为句子级证据识别和带引用的答案合成，使用DSPy MIPROv2优化器自动探索提示空间，并引入自洽投票提升证据召回率。

Result: 测试集总体得分51.5（第二名），较标准零样本/少样本提示分别提升20+和10+分，证据召回率提高且精度未下降。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的提示优化是临床QA中模型微调的高效替代方案，可增强医疗AI可靠性，推动辅助系统发展。

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）在概率预测中存在局限性，而现有机器学习模型在灵活性、集合生成能力及空间结构捕捉方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用约束模型集合方法，通过模型扰动生成概率预测，直接以连续秩概率评分（CRPS）为目标函数进行端到端训练，仅依赖边际数据但捕捉空间关联。

Result: 在确定性/概率指标上达到SOTA，实现热带气旋路径的可靠预测，并成功建模空间联合分布（尽管仅使用边际训练）。

Conclusion: FGN证明了通过直接优化预测质量指标与约束模型扰动策略，可构建简单且可扩展的天气预测框架，显著提升集合预报性能。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based weather models have rapidly risen to prominence
due to their greater accuracy and speed than traditional forecasts based on
numerical weather prediction (NWP), recently outperforming traditional
ensembles in global probabilistic weather forecasting. This paper presents FGN,
a simple, scalable and flexible modeling approach which significantly
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models. FGN generates ensembles via
learned model-perturbations with an ensemble of appropriately constrained
models. It is trained directly to minimize the continuous rank probability
score (CRPS) of per-location forecasts. It produces state-of-the-art ensemble
forecasts as measured by a range of deterministic and probabilistic metrics,
makes skillful ensemble tropical cyclone track predictions, and captures joint
spatial structure despite being trained only on marginals.

### [156] [Monotone Classification with Relative Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10775)
*Yufei Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了在单调分类中，以相对误差因子(1+ε)逼近最优分类器所需的最小标签查询成本，提出了近乎匹配的上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单调分类算法仅能保证误差与最优解的绝对差值，而实际应用中更需关注相对误差比例。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，研究如何以更经济的标签查询成本实现相对误差保证。

Method: 通过设计新的算法框架，在保持分类器单调性的前提下，系统性地控制标签查询次数，同时建立误差与最优解的相对关系。采用组合分析与概率方法推导理论边界。

Result: 针对任意ε≥0，给出了误差至多(1+ε)k*时查询成本的最优上下界，其差距在常数因子内。显著优于仅保证绝对误差(k*+Δ)的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为单调分类问题建立了相对误差保证的理论基础，在数据标注成本与分类精度间实现了根本性权衡，对主动学习等场景具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

*Benjamin Hoover,Zhaoyang Shi,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian,Dmitry Krotov,Parikshit Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Epanechnikov核的新型能量函数log-sum-ReLU（LSR），用于密集关联记忆网络（DenseAM）。相比传统LSE函数，LSR无需指数分离函数即可实现精确记忆检索，并引入大量涌现的局部极小值，同时保持完美模式恢复能力。实验表明LSR具有更高存储容量和生成潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DenseAM中常用的log-sum-exponential（LSE）函数需要依赖指数分离函数来实现记忆检索，且缺乏丰富的局部极小值结构。本文旨在通过最优核密度估计思想，开发更高效且具有生成潜力的记忆模型。

Method: 提出基于Epanechnikov核的log-sum-ReLU（LSR）能量函数，通过理论分析证明其可实现精确记忆容量指数增长，并构造出具有丰富涌现局部极小值的能量景观。

Result: 实验显示LSR比LSE模型具有显著更多的局部极小值（记忆点），且保持可比的对数似然。在图像数据集上，涌现记忆表现出创造性和新颖性特征。

Conclusion: LSR突破了传统DenseAM的局限性，兼具大规模记忆存储和生成任务潜力，其涌现记忆特性为关联记忆模型开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用基于合成数据训练的激活探针检测大语言模型高风险交互，在保持监测性能的同时实现百万倍计算效率提升，并构建分层监测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署中，检测可能导致重大危害的'高风险'交互是当前监控系统的研究空白，需要开发针对性监测方法。

Method: 通过多种探针架构在合成数据上的训练，评估其在真实场景中的跨分布泛化能力，并与中等规模LLM监测器进行对比实验。

Result: 探针监测性能与微调/提示型LLM监测器相当，计算成本降低10^6倍；验证了探针作为高效过滤器构建分层监测系统的可行性。

Conclusion: 激活探针为LLM安全监控提供高效解决方案，通过开源合成数据集和代码推动该领域研究，分层系统架构平衡资源与监测精度需求。

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究动态深度学习系统（DDLS）的效率鲁棒性，提出针对其动态行为的效率对抗攻击分类法，揭示现有防御机制的局限性，并强调开发新防护策略的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态深度学习系统（DDLS）通过自适应推理提高效率，但其动态行为引入了新的攻击面——效率对抗攻击，可能严重降低系统性能。现有研究缺乏对此类攻击的系统性分析及防御策略的有效性验证。

Method: 提出首个针对DDLS动态行为的效率攻击分类法，涵盖动态计算、动态推理迭代和动态输出三类攻击；通过深入评估攻击策略，分析现有防御机制（如对抗训练）的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，效率攻击可显著降低DDLS性能，现有防御方法无法有效应对此类攻击，需开发针对性更强的策略以保护未来自适应系统。

Conclusion: 效率对抗攻击对DDLS构成严重威胁，当前防御手段不足，需结合动态行为特性设计新型防护机制以确保系统安全性与效率平衡。

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过结合熵正则化与约束惩罚，在无模型强化学习中实现鲁棒安全性的新视角。研究表明，熵正则化能促进智能体最大化未来可行行动数量，从而提升对动作噪声的约束满足；通过将严格约束松弛为惩罚项，可将约束问题近似为无约束问题，并保持安全性与最优性。

Method: 1) 实证分析熵正则化对可行行动空间的扩展作用；2) 将硬约束转化为惩罚项，将约束RL问题转化为标准无约束RL问题；3) 使用奖励塑形方法实现安全与鲁棒性的平衡。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效保持约束满足率（安全）的同时，提升对干扰的鲁棒性。熵正则化与惩罚松弛的结合使策略在动作噪声下仍保持高可行性。

Conclusion: 熵正则化与鲁棒安全性的内在关联为RL安全研究提供了新方向。通过简单奖励调整即可实现鲁棒安全，该方法兼具理论价值与工程实用性。

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Result: 实验表明新攻击在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，成功满足双重属性标准，验证了理论分析的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过几何属性定义和新型攻击方法设计，本文为随机集成分类器提供了首个理论完备的攻击框架，显著提升对抗攻击的生成质量。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

TL;DR: 提出NoLoCo优化方法，通过改进Nesterov动量实现无显式参数同步，显著降低大模型训练的通信开销，在低带宽网络中实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模语言模型训练依赖高带宽集群，扩展成本高昂。现有低通信方法仍需全局参数同步，在低带宽网络中仍存在效率瓶颈。

Method: 基于改进型Nesterov动量优化器，通过随机选择模型副本进行部分权重平均实现隐式同步，避免集体通信操作。

Result: 在125M-6.8B参数规模下，通信开销比DiLoCo降低一个量级，同步速度提升10倍，收敛速度加快4%，且消除全局阻塞通信。

Conclusion: NoLoCo有效突破低带宽网络下的训练限制，通过去中心化隐式同步机制实现高效分布式训练，为大规模模型部署提供新方案。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

TL;DR: 本文提出前缀可扫描模型（PSMs），统一了支持并行训练与高效序列推断的神经序列模型，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时匹配状态空间模型的推理效率，部分场景下长度泛化更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何系统描述同时支持近常数时间并行评估和线性时间序列推断的神经序列模型类别，以统一GLA、Mamba等现有架构并扩展新形式。

Method: 1. 将状态空间模型定义为可用并行前缀扫描算法处理的基础类；2. 扩展为更通用的PSMs，允许非关联算子（如softmax注意力）；3. 通过语言建模和合成任务进行实证评估。

Result: PSMs在合成任务中保持Transformer表达能力，推理效率与状态空间模型相当，部分情况下长度泛化能力优于两者，支持O(1)令牌计算和log(N)内存消耗。

Conclusion: PSMs通过放宽状态聚合算子约束，建立了神经序列模型的统一框架，在效率与表达能力之间取得平衡，为新型高效序列模型设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

TL;DR: 研究发现现有大语言模型在招聘场景中引入现实上下文后会产生显著种族和性别偏见，提出通过内部激活向量编辑的偏见缓解方法，在保持性能的同时将偏见率稳定控制在2.5%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在招聘决策中的高风险应用需要消除人口统计偏见，但现有基于提示的偏见缓解方法在真实场景中失效，需开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过识别模型激活向量中与人口统计特征相关的方向，在推理时应用仿射概念编辑进行内部偏见中和，使用合成数据集生成方向但具备跨场景泛化能力。

Result: 实验显示现实上下文(公司信息/筛选条件)会引发12%的面试率差异，所有模型均呈现黑人>白人、女性>男性的系统性偏见，而内部缓解方法将偏见率降至1%以下且保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 建议招聘系统开发者采用基于激活向量编辑的内部偏见缓解方案，并建立包含真实上下文要素的评估框架，以确保语言模型决策的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

TL;DR: SEAL框架通过让大语言模型自主生成微调数据和更新指令，实现自我适应，解决了传统LLMs静态无法动态调整权重的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）虽强大但缺乏动态调整权重的机制，无法根据新任务、知识或示例自适应更新。

Method: 提出SEAL框架：模型生成自我编辑指令（包括数据重构、超参数指定、工具调用），通过监督微调（SFT）持久更新权重，并利用强化学习以性能为奖励训练有效自编辑。

Result: 在知识整合和少样本泛化实验中，SEAL验证了其自导向适应能力，无需依赖外部模块或辅助网络。

Conclusion: SEAL为语言模型自主适应提供了可行路径，实验表明其潜力，未来或推动LLMs动态持续学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD框架通过数据归因指导大语言模型反学习，减少意外遗忘并提升保留性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型反学习方法在移除特定数据时易导致模型效用下降，尤其对高影响力数据。现有研究多关注架构改进，而数据层面对反学习性能的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出GUARD框架：1) 设计轻量级代理数据归因指标，量化遗忘集与保留集的“对齐”程度；2) 基于归因分数分配自适应非均匀反学习权重，逆比例调整样本权重以重新分配反学习能力。

Result: 在TOFU基准测试中，GUARD将保留集的效用牺牲（Truth Ratio）降低194.92%（遗忘10%训练数据时），且遗忘效果与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: GUARD通过数据归因动态调整反学习权重，显著提升模型保留能力，为解决反学习中的意外遗忘问题提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成时通常未利用执行反馈，而人类程序员会实时依赖此类信号。EG-CFG旨在通过动态整合执行反馈弥补这一差距。

Method: EG-CFG采用多阶段流程：1）通过波束搜索逐行生成候选代码补全；2）通过测试用例执行提取执行信号；3）将信号动态整合至生成过程，保持行内一致性并支持多智能体并行探索。

Result: 实验表明EG-CFG在多种编码任务中显著优于标准方法，从基础问题到复杂编程竞赛任务均达到当前最优结果。

Conclusion: EG-CFG通过执行引导机制有效提升代码生成质量，验证了实时反馈在LLMs中的关键作用，并为并行化推理路径探索提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的逆问题求解方法（如DPS）在低信噪比等复杂场景下易偏离数据流形，导致输出不真实。需一种机制同时提升样本质量与奖励一致性。

Method: ReGuidance封装现有算法生成的候选解：1) 反向运行无条件概率流ODE生成潜在表示；2) 以该潜在表示初始化DPS，通过迭代优化同时逼近数据流形并满足逆问题约束。

Result: 在图像大区域修复和高倍超分辨率任务中，ReGuidance显著提升基线方法的样本质量与测量一致性。理论证明其可在多模态数据分布下同时优化奖励与流形逼近。

Conclusion: ReGuidance为DPS类方法提供了严格的算法保证，通过流形重初始化机制有效解决复杂逆问题中的样本失真问题，兼具理论创新与实践价值。

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在自然语言和视觉领域表现优异，但其在结构化几何数据中的理论机制尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究流形几何对ICL的影响。

Method: 通过建立注意力机制与经典核方法的新联系，推导流形上Hölder函数回归的泛化误差界，分析提示长度和训练任务数量对误差的影响。

Result: 当训练任务充足时，变换器达到流形Hölder函数的极小极大回归率，其误差随流形内在维度（而非环境维度）指数级变化，并量化了训练任务数量对误差的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了流形几何在ICL中的核心作用，为理解非线性模型ICL提供了新工具，证明变换器作为上下文算法学习器的复杂度特性。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散桥方法中不同损失函数的优化目标合理性，指出LV损失在扩散桥或学习扩散系数时无法通过数据处理不等式等理论解释，而rKL损失具有更明确的数学动机。

Method: 采用反向KL损失结合对数导数技巧（rKL-LD）训练扩散桥采样器，对比传统LV损失方法，分析理论差异并进行多基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，rKL-LD损失在多个挑战性基准测试中性能优于LV损失，且训练过程更稳定、超参数调整需求显著减少。

Conclusion: rKL-LD损失不仅解决了LV损失的理论缺陷，还提供了更优的采样性能与训练效率，是扩散桥方法的更合理选择。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

Motivation: Gittins指数虽在理论决策问题中表现优异，但其实际应用常被认为有限且定义复杂。本文试图打破这一观念，证明其作为实用工具的可行性。

Method: 通过实例驱动的介绍，逐步解析Gittins指数在多种问题中的解决方案，包括最优解（如经典多臂老虎机）和次优但高效的应用（如贝叶斯优化、队列尾部延迟优化）。

Result: 研究表明，Gittins指数不仅适用于理论最优场景，在次优问题中（如贝叶斯优化）仍能提供卓越性能，尤其在尾部延迟优化中表现突出。

Conclusion: Gittins指数不仅是理论工具，更具备实际应用价值，其灵活性和高效性可扩展至更广泛的决策问题领域，推动理论与实践结合。

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

TL;DR: 该论文提出人工智能通过支持、协同、共生三种模式增强人类创造力，其效果取决于AI的技术自主性与感知代理程度，并探讨了不同模式对创造力层次及理论、伦理和设计的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用人工智能增强人类创造力，明确AI在创造性过程中的作用机制，以弥合理想潜力与实际应用之间的理解差距。

Method: 基于分布式创造力理论框架，从技术自主性和感知代理程度两个维度，分析AI在支持（工具）、协同（互补协作）、共生（认知融合）三种模式中的角色。

Result: 不同AI配置模式对应不同层级的创造力（日常问题解决至范式革新），揭示了技术自主性与人类对AI的代理感知如何共同影响创造性系统的效能与边界。

Conclusion: AI与人类创造力的整合需系统化分类与设计，三种模式为理论构建、伦理规范及人机协作系统开发提供了结构化路径，未来需进一步研究跨模式动态转换机制。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文通过范围综述分析30项研究，探讨生成式AI（GAI）在促进社交互动中的应用设计、目标形式及方法，强调其动态个性化潜力，但需关注公平性与包容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会联系减少威胁心理健康与福祉，而生成式AI技术（如大语言模型）虽被广泛用于增强社交体验，但其对社交互动的影响尚不明确。

Method: 对2020年以来的30项研究进行范围综述，分析GAI应用的设计目标、社交互动形式及设计评估方法，涵盖参与式设计和社会伦理问题。

Result: 识别出GAI在故事创作、情感技能训练、协作学习等领域的应用趋势，参与式设计促进有效技术使用，但存在文化偏见和可访问性等伦理挑战。

Conclusion: GAI具备支持动态个性化社交互动的潜力，但需加强公平设计实践与包容性评估策略，以应对技术应用中的社会伦理风险。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing
precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed
for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains
challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In
this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language
models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data
collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To
enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task
specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge
high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering
farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these
technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce
additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly
challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with
existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic
mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽提升多模态理解能力，但面临计算成本高、实时部署困难的问题，需探索无需微调的高效导航方案。

Method: 使用冻结的Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型处理视觉语言理解，结合轻量级规划逻辑、提示工程、结构化历史管理和双帧视觉输入策略实现决策连续性。

Result: 在VLN-CE的Room-to-Room基准测试中，使用Matterport3D数据集和Habitat-Lab模拟环境验证，显示对未见环境泛化能力有限，但模块化架构展现潜力。

Conclusion: 模块化框架为高效导航系统提供基础，未来可通过增强环境先验知识、扩展多模态输入集成进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过结合自然语言中的道路规范与结构化元数据，增强现有车道拓扑预测方法SMERF，在复杂交叉口场景中提升车道与交通元素的检测及关联性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车道拓扑预测需准确理解道路环境，而道路设计规范（编码自然语言）与道路名称（反映道路功能）包含关键结构化信息，可增强模型对多样化道路拓扑的适应性。

Method: 在SMERF模型中轻量化融合OSM地图的结构化道路元数据、道路设计手册中的车道宽度先验知识，以及道路中心线编码，形成多源信息融合框架。

Result: 在两种地理多样性复杂交叉口场景的测试中，车道与交通元素检测及其关联性均得到提升，使用四项拓扑感知指标验证了模型泛化能力与扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过融合自然语言编码的规范与结构化元数据，该方法能有效适应多样化道路拓扑条件，为自动驾驶提供更鲁棒的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文首次将高斯混合Copula模型应用于自动驾驶场景的统计建模，通过结合高斯混合模型的多模态表达能力与Copula的依赖关系灵活性，在联合国157号法规场景数据中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于场景的安全评估需要精确的联合概率分布建模，而传统方法难以同时处理多模态数据和灵活建模边际分布与依赖关系。

Method: 提出高斯混合Copula模型，分离建模边际分布与依赖结构，并与高斯混合模型、高斯Copula模型进行对比实验。

Result: 在1800万场景实例测试中，新模型在似然估计和Sinkhorn距离指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 高斯混合Copula模型为自动驾驶场景验证框架提供了更可靠的概率建模基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于多模态视觉编码器的自主学习方法，通过结合预训练与微调策略，利用RGB、深度和语义分割等多模态输入预测多吸盘机器人抓取成功率，在工业规模稀疏标记数据上实现高效分拣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库等真实场景中机器人从非结构化堆叠中抓取多样化物品的挑战，需在开放物品集和低延迟约束下提升分拣效率。现有方法在部分遮挡场景和包裹类物品抓取中性能不足。

Method: 1. 多模态输入融合（RGB/深度/语义分割）
2. 多阶段训练：跨模态预训练+领域微调
3. 构建三大数据集（常规物品/部分遮挡/包裹类）进行消融实验

Result: 1. 多模态联合训练使模型学习模态间隐含关系
2. 预训练后推理时可仅使用部分模态（如仅RGB）
3. 在包裹类物品数据集上表现显著优于传统方法

Conclusion: 多模态预训练能有效编码跨模态关联性，即使微调阶段仅使用部分输入模态仍可保持性能，为工业机器人抓取系统提供高适应性解决方案。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出VLFly框架，通过结合大语言模型和视觉语言模型，使无人机仅凭单目摄像头实现语言引导的连续速度控制，解决了视觉语言导航中的分布外泛化和离散动作空间依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航（VLN）领域长期面临两大挑战：对分布外环境的泛化能力不足，以及依赖固定离散动作空间。针对无人机导航场景，需实现无需定位传感器、仅凭单目视觉的连续控制。

Method: VLFly框架包含三模块：1) 基于LLM的指令编码器将自然语言转化为结构化提示；2) 基于VLM的目标检索器通过视觉-语言相似度匹配目标图像；3) 路径规划器生成连续轨迹实现实时控制。

Result: 在未微调情况下，VLFly在多种仿真环境中超越基线方法。真实场景测试表明其具备开放词汇目标理解和泛化导航能力，可处理抽象语言指令。

Conclusion: VLFly通过多模态模型融合实现了无人机端到端的语言导航控制，验证了连续动作空间方案在复杂环境中的有效性，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Motivation: 旨在解决传统基于物理的高保真模拟在机器人-颗粒地形交互研究中计算成本高的问题，同时提升在线和离线阶段的预测效率与准确性。

Method: 集成降维技术（ST-HOSVD）、代理模型（高斯过程）和数据同化（降阶粒子滤波），利用离线高保真模拟数据与稀疏实验数据进行在线建模。

Result: 计算时间减少数量级，仅用模拟数据时预测精度与模拟相当；结合实验数据后，长期预测性能可能超越纯模拟。方法还能复现物理模拟的阻力关系，显示普适性。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人在复杂未知地形中的导航与探索提供了高效可靠的建模工具，兼具实时性与扩展预测能力。

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

Conclusion: 该方法为双重不平衡条件下的随机森林变量选择提供了实用且可解释的解决方案，显著提升特征选择稳定性与模型性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

*Rudy Alexandro Garrido Veliz,Martin Semmann,Chris Biemann,Seid Muhie Yimam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出首个针对美国新法西斯主义数字话语的编码方案，结合自然语言处理与政治科学，通过标注论坛内容训练分类模型，揭示其言论普遍性并强调社会背景的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新法西斯主义在欧美社会迅速蔓延，严重威胁民主与少数群体。需通过技术手段主动识别并遏制其发展，填补NLP与政治科学在此领域的合作空白。

Method: 开发新法西斯主义编码框架，采集Iron March和Stormfront.org论坛数据，通过众包标注1000条帖子，使用SLM和LLM微调分类模型。

Result: 成功构建首个新法西斯主义文本分类模型，验证论坛中此类言论的广泛存在，证实社会语境对NLP检测的关键影响。

Conclusion: 打击新法西斯主义需持续技术干预，结合社会背景的NLP研究对维护社会民主至关重要，相关分析应聚焦内容而非个体标签。

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting
NLP research. Finally, the work against this kind of political movement must be
pressed upon and continued for the well-being of a democratic society.
Disclaimer: This study focuses on detecting neo-fascist content in text,
similar to other hate speech analyses, without labeling individuals or
organizations.

TL;DR: 研究探讨利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成个性化学习问题答案的潜力，通过不同策略和评估方法验证其有效性，发现提供示例可显著提升回答质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习需个性化支持以提升学习体验，但定制化回答会增加教育者负担。LLMs可能通过自动生成个性化答案解决此问题。

Method: 基于StackExchange平台构建验证框架与数据集，在语言学习和编程领域测试0-shot、1-shot、few-shot策略，结合BERTScore、LLM评估和人工评估分析结果。

Result: 向LLMs提供学习者或类似学习者的示例答案，能显著增强模型针对个体需求生成定制化回答的能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs结合示例生成个性化答案的策略可行，可提升在线学习参与度并降低教育者工作量。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 本文提出scSSL-Bench基准，评估19种自监督学习方法在单细胞数据中的表现，发现任务需不同方法，随机掩码增强效果最佳，并呼吁开发专用多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）在单细胞数据分析中潜力显著，但缺乏系统性评估。研究旨在明确不同SSL方法在单细胞任务中的优劣，推动深度学习与单细胞基因组学的结合。

Method: 构建scSSL-Bench基准，覆盖9个数据集，评估19种SSL方法在批次校正、细胞注释、多模态预测三个任务的表现，并系统分析数据增强策略。

Result: 任务特异性明显：scVI等专用框架擅长批次校正，通用SSL方法（如VICReg）在细胞分型和多模态整合更优；随机掩码增强效果超越领域专用方法；需开发单细胞专用多模态框架。

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench为单细胞SSL提供标准化评估平台与实用建议，强调任务适配方法选择及多模态框架开发的必要性，推动领域技术融合。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 基因组语言模型（gLMs）预测功能丧失突变的能力与其对原始序列的似然预测及序列长度密切相关，需综合两者以提高合成生物学应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基因组语言模型（gLMs）在合成生物学中生成功能性DNA序列的能力，需验证其是否掌握序列与功能的关联，而不仅是进化合理性。

Method: 提出Nullsettes预测任务，通过模拟关键调控元件易位导致的功能丧失突变，测试12个前沿模型对突变效应的预测性能。

Result: 突变效应预测性能与未突变序列的模型预测似然强相关，且有效预测区间高度依赖序列长度。

Conclusion: 使用gLMs预测突变效应时，需同时考虑序列似然值和序列长度，二者共同决定模型性能。

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，通过近似优化方法识别大型异质数据集中的同质子集，应用于乳腺癌患者亚群分析及甲基化与基因表达关联研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理非均匀数据集时，识别同质子集（如特定患者亚群）对精准医学和疾病机制研究至关重要，但现有方法效率不足。

Method: 设计基于Goemans-Williamson舍入技术的线性分类器算法，对优化问题提供0.82近似比的近似解。

Result: 算法成功在乳腺癌RNA数据中识别转移病例主导的亚群，并发现甲基化水平与核受体表达的统计学显著共变子集。

Conclusion: 该方法为疾病通路发现和亚群特异性治疗策略开发提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出一种通过对话延续训练实现零样本指令跟随的音频理解模型，无需多任务调优即可适应未知指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频字幕生成模型直接生成目标字幕，存在字幕变异性问题，且难以捕捉深层语义。本文旨在通过对话延续机制增强模型对指令的适应能力。

Method: 利用大语言模型（LLMs）的对话延续能力，训练模型以输入字幕触发对话的形式生成响应，而非直接生成字幕。该方法通过对话上下文学习超越表面词汇的语义表达。

Result: 在AudioCaps等数据集上的实验表明，模型在AudioBench音频场景问答测试中能有效遵循未见过的多样化指令，验证了零样本指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 对话延续训练机制有效缓解字幕变异性问题，使模型仅通过音频字幕数据即可实现无需多任务调优的指令跟随，扩展了音频理解模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

Conclusion: RT-VC通过特征解耦与DDSP技术，实现了质量与延迟的平衡，为零样本实时语音转换提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别器在新说话者适应时面临数据量少且无标签的问题，单假设伪标签微调容易受初始识别错误影响，需要更鲁棒的自适应方法。

Method: 1. 提出基于完整假设条件熵的多假设损失函数，降低初始识别错误影响；2. 设计低维说话者编码向量，实现小数据量下的说话者特征表征。

Result: 在噪声增强版Common Voice数据集上，1分钟自适应数据词错误率相对改善20%，10分钟数据时提升至29%。

Conclusion: 多假设条件熵与说话者编码的结合有效提升了小数据场景下的语音识别自适应能力，显著降低词错误率。

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

TL;DR: 提出基于患者特异性深度强化学习（DRL）的自动化IMPT再规划框架，通过奖励机制优化治疗计划质量，解决头颈癌治疗中因解剖变化导致的剂量分布问题，并在临床数据中验证其优于人工再规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头颈癌调强质子治疗（IMPT）中，解剖结构变化会导致布拉格峰偏移，影响肿瘤与正常器官的剂量分布。传统人工再规划耗时且资源密集，亟需自动化高效解决方案。

Method: 设计患者特异性DRL框架，结合150分计划质量评分作为奖励机制，使用DQN和PPO算法训练个性化代理，基于CT影像及模拟解剖变化数据调整优化优先级，以剂量体积直方图（DVH）为状态输入，22维动作空间控制优化参数。

Result: 在5例头颈癌患者实际再规划CT数据中，DQN和PPO分别将初始评分从120.63±21.40提升至139.78±6.84和142.74±5.16，优于人工再规划结果（137.20±5.58），临床验证显示肿瘤覆盖和正常器官保护均改善。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决质子治疗自适应规划中的几何与剂量学挑战，为离线自适应提供高效方案，并推动在线自适应质子治疗发展，证明患者特异性方法在解剖变化适应性中的优势。

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了高维动力学方程UQ问题，在均匀/非均匀多尺度场景中验证了其高效性与物理保真性。

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

*Parsa Rahimi,Sebastien Marcel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ScoreMix，一种基于扩散模型分数组合特性的数据增强方法，通过在采样过程中混合不同类别的分数生成挑战性样本，显著提升判别器性能，尤其在标记数据有限时效果突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标记数据有限场景下判别模型性能提升的难题，同时减少对大规模数据收集的依赖。

Method: 利用扩散模型的分数组合特性，在扩散采样时对来自不同类别的条件轨迹分数进行凸混合，生成高难度合成样本以增强判别器训练。

Result: 实验表明：1)混合判别器嵌入空间中的远距离类别比生成器条件空间中的邻近类别更有效；2)生成器条件空间与判别器嵌入空间相关性低；3)无需复杂调参即可在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: ScoreMix通过生成对抗性样本有效提升判别模型性能，尤其适用于小数据场景，且揭示了生成器与判别器表征空间解耦的现象，具有实际部署优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

*Hamzeh Asgharnezhad,Pegah Tabarisaadi,Abbas Khosravi,Roohallah Alizadehsani,U. Rajendra Acharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）在HAM10000数据集上评估深度学习皮肤癌分类模型，发现CLIP视觉变换器结合SVM性能最佳，且集成方法在准确性与不确定性处理间取得平衡，强调UQ对提升医疗诊断可信度的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在皮肤癌分类中受限于数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性评估，可能影响临床应用的可靠性和早期治疗效果。

Method: 分两阶段：1) 对比多种预训练特征提取器（如CLIP、ResNet50等）与传统分类器（SVM、XGBoost等）的性能；2) 集成蒙特卡洛丢弃（MCD）、集成及混合方法（EMCD）进行不确定性量化，使用UAcc、USen等指标评估。

Result: CLIP ViT-H/14结合SVM分类效果最优；集成方法在准确性与不确定性处理间平衡较好，而EMCD对不确定预测更敏感。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化整合至深度学习模型可提升皮肤癌诊断的准确性和临床可信度，集成方法尤其适用于实际医疗场景。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出VideoDeepResearch框架，仅通过纯文本推理模型结合多模态工具包，显著提升长视频理解任务性能，无需依赖传统多模态大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为长视频理解需依赖多模态大模型的扩展窗口、强视觉能力及领域知识，但本文挑战该假设，探索仅用文本模型与现成工具组合的可能性。

Method: 基于纯文本大推理模型(LRM)与模块化多模态工具包（含检索器与感知器），通过智能体框架动态制定任务策略，选择性调用必要视频内容。

Result: 在MLVU(test)、LVBench和LongVideoBench基准上分别以9.6%、6.6%、3.9%超越SOTA，验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: 智能体系统可突破长视频理解的核心瓶颈，证明无需复杂多模态大模型即能高效处理该任务，为领域提供新范式。

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌作为全球最高发癌症，其临床SOAP笔记手工记录耗时耗力，加剧医生职业倦怠。现有方法依赖大量标注数据且缺乏临床可扩展性。

Method: 基于弱监督学习框架，结合皮肤病变图像和稀疏临床文本等多模态数据，自动生成结构化SOAP笔记。通过降低人工标注依赖实现临床可扩展性。

Result: 在临床相关性指标上达到与GPT-4o/Claude/DeepSeek Janus Pro相当水平，新提出的MedConceptEval和CCS指标分别验证医学概念语义对齐度与临床特征一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效降低临床文档记录负担，通过多模态弱监督方法实现可扩展的临床结构化输出生成，同时减少对大规模标注数据的需求。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

TL;DR: 研究视觉语言模型（VLMs）在在线学习环境中识别学生学术情绪的表现，发现Qwen模型在识别困惑情绪上表现较好，但均无法检测分心行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习模型在跨场景泛化能力上存在局限，需反复进行数据收集与训练。视觉语言模型（VLMs）的零样本推理特性为跨场景学术情绪分析提供了新可能性。

Method: 使用Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct两个VLMs模型，通过零样本提示对5,000张包含困惑、分心、快乐、中性、疲惫表情的学生图像进行识别。

Result: Qwen模型整体表现更优，两模型均擅长识别快乐情绪但无法检测分心行为。Qwen在困惑情绪识别上表现突出，准确率达相对较高水平。

Conclusion: VLMs在学术情绪分析中展现应用潜力，特别是Qwen模型对困惑情绪的识别能力。分心行为检测需模型改进，未来可通过优化提示或结合多模态数据提升性能。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

TL;DR: 本研究提出基于视觉语言模型的多模态框架UrbanSense，通过构建UrbanDiffBench数据集，实现城市街景风格的自动化定量分析与比较，验证了其在捕捉风格差异和解释城市演变中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统城市文化研究依赖专家经验和历史文献，难以标准化且主观性强。为提升客观性，需开发数据驱动的自动化方法，以北京、深圳为例探究城市街景风格演变。

Method: 提出基于视觉语言模型的多模态框架UrbanSense：1) 构建跨时期、跨区域的街景数据集UrbanDiffBench；2) 开发量化生成与比较城市风格表征的算法。

Result: 实验显示：超过80%生成描述通过t检验（p<0.05）；主观评估Phi分数高（城市0.912，时期0.833），证明方法能捕捉细微风格差异。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市风格演变提供了可量化的科学分析工具，其数据驱动特性有助于未来城市研究的客观化与标准化，具有设计实践指导价值。

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Conclusion: 直接从视频学习上下文图像编辑可行，模型具备通用编辑能力并扩展应用场景，验证了视频作为训练源的潜力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图像在人类文明与学习中具有核心地位（如双编码理论、图片优势效应），但生成此类图像需融合多模态推理与像素级视觉表达，现有模型在此类任务中缺乏系统性评估标准。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

Conclusion: Pisces通过分编码器与训练策略平衡多模态任务冲突，证明统一模型可行性，推动多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

Motivation: 现有DNN量化研究多聚焦于训练过程优化，但权重初始化对量化鲁棒性的影响尚未被系统探索。受浮点模型初始化影响精度的启发，作者认为初始化策略同样会影响量化后模型的性能。

Method: 1. 系统分析不同初始化方法对CNN模块量化鲁棒性的影响；2. 提出GHN-QAT方法：通过微调图超网络预测量化图参数，实现量化感知的初始化。

Result: 1. 初始化策略显著影响量化精度；2. GHN-QAT在4-bit量化中提升明显，2-bit仍优于随机初始化；3. 首次实现量化感知初始化与常规训练的协同优化。

Conclusion: GHN-QAT为量化模型设计提供了新范式，未来结合量化感知训练可进一步简化流程。该研究填补了DNN量化初始化领域的空白。

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM通过任务解耦降低标注需求，结合定位-分割协同优化，有效解决复杂场景干扰，为遥感图像分割提供新范式。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,

TL;DR: 本文提出ViCrit任务，通过训练视觉语言模型定位人工注入的视觉描述错误，有效提升视觉感知能力。该方法在多个基准测试中表现优异，并展现出跨域推理的泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在语言模型中的成功难以迁移至视觉语言模型，主要因缺乏兼具挑战性和明确可验证性的视觉任务。ViCrit任务旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在人类撰写的图像描述中注入细微的视觉幻觉错误（如物体属性/数量/空间关系），要求模型结合图像定位错误文本段，通过二元精确匹配奖励进行强化学习训练。

Result: ViCrit训练后的模型在多种视觉语言基准测试中显著提升性能，且能泛化至抽象图像推理和视觉数学等未训练领域，表明其学习的是感知能力而非数据记忆。

Conclusion: 细粒度幻觉批判是增强视觉语言模型感知能力的有效通用目标，配套的ViCrit-Bench评估基准可系统诊断跨域感知错误。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出CogStream任务，解决流媒体视频推理中历史上下文冗余问题，并开发CogReasoner基线模型及标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在流媒体推理中依赖全部历史上下文，导致计算负担高且易受无关信息干扰，需针对性优化。

Method: 提出CogStream任务框架，采用半自动标注生成层次化问答数据集，并设计CogReasoner模型，结合视觉流压缩与历史对话检索机制。

Result: 实验验证CogReasoner能有效筛选关键历史信息，显著提升流媒体视频推理效率与准确性。

Conclusion: CogStream任务及对应解决方案为流媒体视频理解提供新基准，模型通过上下文压缩与检索机制实现高效推理，代码即将开源。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标难以检测高性能人脸识别系统中由分数分布尾部细微差异导致的人口统计偏差，需开发针对性评估工具。

Method: 设计CEI指标，分别分析真实匹配与冒名分数分布，支持可配置尾部概率分析；并开发自动化版本CEI^A以提升客观性。

Result: 实验表明CEI能有效识别现有方法遗漏的细微偏差，CEI^A进一步简化应用流程，增强评估结果的客观性。

Conclusion: CEI为人脸识别公平性评估提供敏感且鲁棒的工具，其方法可扩展至其他需分析分布尾部的统计比较场景。

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

TL;DR: 提出基于扩散Transformer的框架DreamActor-H1，通过引入配对参考信息、掩码交叉注意力及3D身体网格模板，解决电商视频中人物与商品身份保持、空间关系理解的难题，生成高保真产品演示视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持人物/商品身份特征、理解人-物空间关系方面存在不足，导致视频呈现不真实、交互不自然，需改进以提升电商产品展示效果。

Method: 结合扩散Transformer架构，注入配对参考信息保持身份细节；使用3D身体网格模板与商品边界框提供运动引导；引入结构化文本编码增强跨帧3D一致性；采用混合数据集与数据增强策略训练。

Result: 在身份完整性保持（如人体特征、商品logo/纹理）和动作自然度方面超越SOTA方法，生成视频具有更真实的演示动作与空间交互。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态信息融合与几何约束，有效解决了人-物交互视频生成的保真度问题，为电商数字营销提供了高质量内容生成方案。

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到纹理合成方法因扩散过程中对已合成纹理整合不足、自回归合成特性及预定义相机位置不考虑物体几何形状，导致视角间纹理属性偏移和一致性下降。

Method: 结合重采样方案（在扩散过程中反复整合已合成纹理信息）、微调深度感知扩散模型、提出性能保持损失以缓解训练数据不足问题，并基于物体几何自适应调整相机位置。

Result: 在Objaverse子集和ShapeNet汽车数据集上的实验表明，TexTailor在视角一致纹理合成方面优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TexTailor通过改进纹理信息整合与相机位置优化，显著提升跨视角纹理一致性，且代码开源可供复现。

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配方法在跨任务统一建模、双向一致性及生成多样性方面存在局限。本文旨在通过对称学习框架整合多任务，解决严格一对一映射约束，提升模型灵活性与效率。

Method: 提出对称流匹配框架：1) 联合建模前向/反向流，通过双向一致性目标保持熵；2) 显式保留跨流语义信息的新训练目标；3) 支持像素级掩码和图像级标签的灵活条件生成。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ和COCO-Stuff上分别取得FID 11.9和7.0（25步推理），达到SOTA图像合成效果；在分割和分类任务中表现竞争力，代码将开源。

Conclusion: SymmFlow首次实现多任务统一建模，通过对称学习机制平衡生成质量与效率，为跨模态生成任务提供新范式，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出PiPViT模型，通过视觉Transformer捕获图像块间长程依赖关系，结合对比学习和多尺度输入处理，在视网膜OCT分类中实现高性能与临床可解释的原型可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有原型方法在医学影像中面临两个问题：1) 像素空间可视化与人类可理解的生物标志物不一致；2) 过细粒度的原型难以解释病变范围的重要性。

Method: 基于视觉Transformer架构，利用图像块(patch)构建长程依赖关系，通过对比学习和多分辨率输入实现跨尺度生物标志物定位，仅需图像级标签即可学习病变范围的原型表示。

Result: 在四个视网膜OCT数据集上达到SOTA可比性能，定量实验证明原型具有临床相关性，可视化解释更符合医生诊断逻辑。

Conclusion: PiPViT通过可解释的原型学习机制，能够透明化决策过程并辅助临床诊断，其原型表示同时捕捉生物标志物存在性与病变范围特征。

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Motivation: 传统持续学习仅关注实例或类别分类，但实际应用（如自动驾驶）需同时处理两者。现实场景中类与实例天然形成层次结构，需平衡细粒度实例识别与粗粒度类别泛化。

Method: 提出HyperCLIC算法：利用双曲空间低失真表示层次结构的特性，结合双曲分类与蒸馏目标，持续嵌入层次关系，并设计持续层次评估指标。

Conclusion: 通过双曲空间建模层次关系，HyperCLIC为多粒度持续学习提供了新解决方案，验证了在复杂现实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: 图像处理框架为自注意力机制提供了系统性理论解释，其衍生的结构改进兼具可解释性与实用性，揭示了理论分析与工程实践协同优化的可能性。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Conclusion: SbCA通过矢量分解与循环优化机制，突破传统方法对训练尺度范围的依赖，为超大规模图像超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进零样本生成模型适应（ZSGM）的方法AIR，通过分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本与图像偏移的未对齐现象，发现其与概念距离相关，并设计迭代优化策略提升生成质量，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSGM方法假设CLIP嵌入空间中图像偏移与文本偏移完全对齐，但实际存在未对齐问题，导致生成图像质量下降。本文旨在分析未对齐现象并提出解决方案。

Method: 1. 实证分析CLIP嵌入空间中文本与图像偏移的未对齐现象，发现其与概念距离相关（概念越近，未对齐越小）；2. 提出AIR方法，通过迭代优化逐步减少未对齐影响，提升目标域生成质量。

Conclusion: AIR通过迭代优化解决了ZSGM中的偏移未对齐问题，验证了概念距离与未对齐的相关性，为零样本生成模型适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的文本到视频生成方法存在二次计算复杂度问题，而线性时间建模的Mamba架构在多模态时空建模中表现不足，亟需高效且适配多模态的解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态扩散Mamba块（MM-DiM），通过多模态令牌重组整合跨模态信息；引入奖励学习策略缓解长序列生成中的画质退化问题。

Result: 在768×1280分辨率视频生成中，M4V相比注意力机制减少45% FLOPs，实验表明其能生成高质量视频且提升单帧视觉真实感。

Conclusion: M4V证明了Mamba架构在视频生成中的高效性，通过多模态融合与奖励学习的协同设计，为世界模拟器开发提供了新思路，代码将开源。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视觉生成方法将图像视为空间块序列，但块之间本质是并行的，与自回归建模的因果性存在矛盾。需寻找更符合因果性的视觉序列表示方法。

Method: 1. 嵌套频谱标记化(Nested Spectral Tokenization)将图像转换为从低频到高频有序排列的频谱token；2. 以从粗到细的方式对频谱token序列进行自回归生成。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，仅使用64个token和310M参数即达到3.02 gFID指标，验证了方法在重建和生成任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: SpectralAR通过频谱视角的序列构造，同时满足自回归因果性与token效率，无需复杂结构即实现高质量视觉生成，为视觉自回归建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Conclusion: CDPruner通过条件多样性最大化，在高效剪枝的同时保留关键信息，显著提升多模态大语言模型的推理效率与任务适应性。

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

TL;DR: 本文提出HeadHunter框架和SoftPAG方法，通过细粒度调控扩散模型中注意力头的扰动，实现生成质量与视觉属性的精准控制，解决了现有层级扰动方法的过平滑问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有注意力扰动方法在DiT架构中缺乏确定扰动位置的原则性方法，特别是质量相关计算分布在多层时，无法有效定位控制生成质量与视觉概念的关键注意力头。

Method: 提出HeadHunter框架迭代选择与用户目标对齐的注意力头，并设计SoftPAG通过线性插值注意力图实现连续扰动强度调节，支持组合式头部选择进行视觉风格操控。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX.1等模型上验证，该方法在质量增强和风格指导方面优于现有方法，首次揭示了注意力头对结构/风格/纹理等视觉概念的专门化控制特性。

Conclusion: 通过头部级注意力扰动分析，不仅实现了更精细的生成控制，还发现了注意力层的可解释性专业分工，为设计有效扰动策略提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Method: 采用储层计算框架，模拟神经形态网络对多变量混沌时间序列的自主预测，通过调节输入电极和电压优化忆阻器动态响应。

Result: 输入电压最大化忆阻器动态范围时网络性能最佳；增加电极覆盖会抑制不利于学习的非线性响应。

Conclusion: 仅通过外部控制参数（如电压配置）即可优化神经形态网络设备，为学习复杂动力系统提供实用指导。

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

*Souvik Ghosh,Sayak Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 本文通过计算研究扩展SSH模型，揭示拓扑、准周期无序、非厄米性与Floquet驱动间的相互作用，发现局域化会破坏拓扑边缘态，非厄米趋肤效应导致体态边界局域化，并利用Floquet驱动在平庸链中实现拓扑相。

Method: 采用精确对角化与专用数值求解器分析光谱特性与IPR局域化指标，结合PCA无监督机器学习进行相分类，研究非厄米趋肤效应与Floquet周期驱动效应。

Result: 强AAH调制引发局域化相变破坏拓扑边缘态；非厄米系统出现体态边界局域化；Floquet驱动可在平庸链中产生准能量带边异常边缘态。

Conclusion: 广义一维拓扑系统呈现拓扑-局域化-非厄米性-Floquet驱动的多体耦合效应，为设计新型拓扑态提供多维调控思路。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 通过量子精度的大规模显式反应模拟和深度学习势能，揭示了固态电池SEI层中新型晶体无序相Li₂S₀.₇₂P₀.₁₄Cl₀.₁₄的形成机制及锂蠕变动力学，为界面反应建模提供了无参数调整的数字孪生方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固态电池中固体-电解质界面（SEI）的原子级反应机制尚不明确，实验表征和传统模拟方法在速度与精度上存在局限，阻碍了下一代电池开发。

Conclusion: 基于第一性原理的无参数数字孪生方法，可解析固态电化学中复杂异质过程的动力学机制，为界面热力学-动力学协同设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 使用条件变分自编码器（CVAE）结合质量校正，将少量生物地球化学参数映射到三维稳态年循环，生成初始值以加速海洋生态模型自旋过程，显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自旋过程（spin-up）计算稳态年循环耗时巨大，需寻找高效方法减少迭代次数和计算成本。

Method: 利用预计算的稳态数据训练CVAE模型，生成初始值后结合自旋过程，并与均匀常数初始值及训练数据均值初始值进行对比。

Result: CVAE预测的初始值使自旋迭代次数减少50%-95%，计算时间大幅降低；使用训练数据均值初始值虽加速但效果远逊于CVAE。

Conclusion: CVAE生成的初始值显著加速自旋收敛，但预测结果的年周期性精度仍需提升；该方法为高计算成本模型提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM的新框架，通过优化初始条件生成物理一致的最坏情况热浪轨迹，应用于2021年太平洋西北热浪事件，发现比传统方法更高的温度异常，验证了该方法在极端天气风险评估中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于物理模型的大规模集成方法计算成本高昂，且难以准确模拟罕见极端天气事件，需开发高效方法以评估气候变暖下的极端天气上限风险。

Method: 利用可微分混合气候模型NeuralGCM优化初始条件，生成物理自洽的极端热浪情景轨迹。

Result: 在2021年热浪案例中，模型生成温度异常比75成员集成最高值再高3.7°C，揭示出强化的大气阻塞和罗斯贝波放大机制。

Conclusion: 可微分气候模型能有效探索极端天气事件概率分布的尾部特征，为构建针对性气候情景提供新方法论。

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率天气预测模型在优化过程中可能未充分约束小尺度气象变量的变异性，需探索多尺度损失对模型性能的影响。

Method: 在ECMWF开发的AIFS-CRPS模型中引入多尺度损失函数，通过直接优化近似公平连续排序概率评分(afCRPS)进行训练。

Result: 多尺度损失显著提升了小尺度气象变量的约束能力，同时保持整体预测技能不受负面影响。

Conclusion: 多尺度损失框架为开发尺度感知的天气预测模型提供了有效路径，未来可进一步探索其在复杂气象系统中的应用。

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

### [249] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出FastFLUX框架，通过结构剪枝和局部微调策略，在保持FLUX模型图像生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器（如FLUX）因参数量大导致推理速度慢、内存占用高，而传统加速方法存在性能下降和训练成本高的问题。

Method: 结合块级线性层替换（BRLL）保留快捷连接，并设计三明治训练（ST）策略，利用LoRA对邻近模块进行局部监督微调。

Result: 实验表明，FastFLUX在剪枝20%层次结构后仍保持图像质量，且推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: FastFLUX为高参数量生成模型提供了一种高效的结构优化方案，平衡了性能与部署可行性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Method: 基于自然图像的频谱功率律衰减和局部性特性，设计框架处理合成噪声（高斯模糊/JPEG压缩/运动模糊），理论分析噪声对数据分布偏差的抑制作用及扩散时间权衡。

Result: 在ImageNet上实现FID指标SOTA，文本到图像生成任务中显著提升生成质量与多样性，验证合成噪声场景下的模型有效性。

Conclusion: 噪声可有效平衡高质量数据与混合分布偏差，理论证明有限无偏数据与有偏数据的学习权衡，为扩散模型训练提供新范式。

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度均衡映射方法依赖迭代数值解算器或手工能量泛函优化，存在精度不足、极端情况重叠伪影、2D到3D扩展需算法重构等问题。本文旨在通过深度学习克服这些挑战。

Result: 相比现有方法，LDEM在简单/复杂密度分布下均展现更优的密度均衡特性与双射性，支持无重叠形变，可直接应用于曲面重网格化，且2D到3D扩展无需结构调整。

Conclusion: LDEM为密度均衡映射提供了可扩展且鲁棒的计算框架，通过深度学习范式突破传统方法在微分依赖性和维度扩展上的限制，为数据可视化、几何处理等应用开辟新可能。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在RMSE指标上提升0.8%，排序指标最高提升36%，同时增强数值预测准确性和推荐列表质量。

Conclusion: MCCL通过双重视角表示协同学习，有效缓解噪声干扰和过拟合问题，显著提升推荐系统的泛化性能与预测效果。

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is
available at https://github.com/1371149/LightKG.

Result: 在线实验显示SHORE预测误差相对降低47.91%，离线/在线测试均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SHORE通过多任务学习与鲁棒损失设计，有效解决工业级LTV预测中的零膨胀和异常值问题，验证了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

Conclusion: 通过全局对比锚点和后聚合机制，点式排序方法在保持高效的同时实现更优性能，为大规模文档排序提供了高效且强效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

Conclusion: 所提出的多参数方法能有效识别关键残基，为蛋白质功能研究提供新工具，且与静态分析结合可增强预测可靠性。

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合时空旋转等变性的深度展开网络DUN-SRE，用于动态MRI重建，通过(2+1)D等变卷积架构统一数据一致性与近端映射模块，显著提升心脏电影MRI的运动动态建模精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变卷积神经网络（ECNN）虽能利用空间对称性先验，但无法建模动态MRI中关键的时间对称性，导致重建质量受限。

Method: 提出DUN-SRE网络：1) 通过(2+1)D等变卷积实现时空旋转等变性；2) 将数据一致性模块与近端映射模块集成至深度展开框架；3) 设计高保真群滤波器参数化机制以平衡对称约束与表示精度。

Result: 在心脏电影MRI数据集上验证，DUN-SRE在保留旋转对称结构方面达到SOTA性能，且对多种动态MRI任务具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUN-SRE通过严格传播时空对称约束，为动态MRI重建提供了物理更准确的建模框架，为广泛动态成像任务奠定基础。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Motivation: 颅内出血标注数据获取成本高且耗时长，传统半监督方法过度依赖伪标签置信度或一致性约束，难以有效捕捉病灶细节与边界特征。

Conclusion: SWDL-Net通过互补特征融合机制有效解决了低标注场景下的医学图像分割问题，代码与数据已开源以促进领域发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

Conclusion: 所提框架通过LAIGA实现动态网络配置优化，有效平衡计算资源与信道条件约束，为边缘端图像分类任务提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Motivation: 现有交通事故预测方法依赖标注数据，但交通场景的长尾性、不确定性和快速演变特性导致因果部分难以识别，数据偏差易主导模型训练，造成背景混淆问题。

Result: 实验表明，AVD与EQ-TAA在多个驾驶场景数据集上表现优异，性能达到当前最先进方法水平。

Conclusion: 通过生成因果视频与对比学习，有效缓解数据偏差问题，为无监督交通事故预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应双模态框架，通过动态分支选择、跨模态生成对抗网络和混合训练策略，实现灵活的单/双模态HER2预测，显著提升单模态准确率并降低资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HER2评估模型单独分析H&E或IHC图像，但临床需协同解读。由于工作流程复杂性和成本限制，双模态数据难以同步获取，需开发能兼容单/双模态输入的弹性预测系统。

Method: 1) 动态分支选择器根据输入完整性激活单模态重建或双模态联合推理；2) 双向跨模态GAN实现特征空间模态重建；3) 结合对抗学习和多任务优化的混合训练协议。

Result: H&E单模态准确率从71.44%提升至94.25%，双模态达95.09%；IHC单模态保持90.28%可靠性。跨模态重建F1-score达0.9609(HE→IHC)和0.9251(IHC→HE)，轻量版参数减少78.55%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态路径选择实现'双模态优先-单模态兼容'，在无需同步采集的情况下达到近似双模态性能，显著降低IHC基础设施成本，为资源有限环境提供精准HER2评估解决方案。

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于扩散模型的多模态可控3D面部动画框架，通过多模态情感绑定策略和注意力潜扩散模型，解决了传统方法在情感控制多样性和动态表现力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动3D面部动画存在两个问题：(1)依赖单一模态控制信号，未能整合多模态互补优势；(2)确定性回归映射限制了情感表达的随机性和非语言行为多样性。

Method: 提出两个创新：(1)基于FLAME模型的多模态情感对比学习绑定策略，整合文本/音频/情感标签；(2)含内容注意力和情感引导层的潜扩散模型，增强运动多样性并保持时序连贯性。

Result: 实验表明方法在多数指标上超越现有技术，情感相似度提升21.6%，同时保持生理合理的面部动态。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和概率建模，显著提升了3D面部动画的情感表现力和控制灵活性，为数字人交互应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层知识图谱框架，用于解析漫画等视觉叙事的结构，通过多层级知识图谱整合语义、时空关系，支持跨叙事层次的符号推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事(如漫画)包含复杂的多模态信息，传统方法难以结构化解析其故事线、角色关联与事件演进。需要一种可解释的框架支持系统性内容分析。

Method: 构建分层知识图谱：宏观故事弧-细粒度事件段的多级分解，面板级多模态图融合视觉元素(角色/物体/动作)与文本(对话/字幕)，集成时空语义特征。基于Manga109数据集进行人工标注验证。

Result: 在动作检索、对话追踪等任务中达到高精度(high precision)与召回率(high recall)，面板时间线重建等任务验证了框架的连贯性与可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为视觉媒体的叙事分析、互动叙事及多模态推理提供了可扩展的基础架构，通过结构化知识表征增强了对复杂叙事内容的机器理解能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于小波变换的多模态意图识别框架(WDMIR)，通过频域分析非语言信息提升意图理解，在MIntRec数据集上以1.13%准确率优势超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态意图识别方法过度依赖文本分析，忽视了视频、音频等非语言模态中蕴含的丰富语义信息，导致意图理解存在局限性。

Method: 提出小波驱动的双模态频域同步分解融合模块，实现细粒度时序动态分析；设计跨模态渐进增强机制，通过双模态到三模态的层级交互弥合语言与非语言信息语义鸿沟。

Result: 在MIntRec数据集上达到SOTA性能(准确率+1.13%)，消融实验表明小波融合模块使非语言语义提取提升0.41%准确率，尤其在细微情感线索识别中效果显著。

Conclusion: 频域分析与渐进式跨模态交互能有效挖掘非语言信息语义价值，为多模态意图识别提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 研究通过分析IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动数据，揭示情感语音与面部/手部运动的动态耦合机制，发现非重叠语音增强下半脸活跃度，不同情绪在对话结构下呈现差异化表达，且语音特征对运动预测的准确性存在区域特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情感表达中语音与面部、手势的跨模态协调机制，分析对话结构（如轮流发言与同时说话）对多模态同步及情感清晰度的影响，以提升实时情感检测的时序准确性。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP语料库的3D动作捕捉数据，量化面部/手部位移活跃度，结合低阶声学特征（韵律、MFCCs）与模型衍生的情感维度（唤醒度、效价、分类情绪），通过语音到手势预测映射分析跨模态关联。

Result: 非重叠语音显著增强下半脸运动（尤其悲伤情绪），愤怒在重叠时抑制手势；韵律/MFCCs对发音区域预测最佳，唤醒度与重叠语音增强手部同步，而效价关联性低且情境敏感。

Conclusion: 多模态协调受情绪类型与对话结构共同调控，语音特征与运动预测的关联存在区域特异性，为优化情感识别系统提供了跨模态时序动态的关键依据。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐生成模型缺乏细粒度特征控制能力，需开发在推理阶段直接干预模型激活的方法，以增强对生成音乐属性的精确调控。

Method: 通过线性探针权重引导残差流，或直接调控注意力层激活。采用回归任务建模，利用均方误差保留激活空间方向信息，结合文本提示的全局条件控制。

Result: 该方法成功实现音色/风格转换和跨流派融合，回归任务建模相比分类方法性能更优，文本条件与激活干预形成互补控制机制。

Conclusion: 提出的推理时干预方法为音乐生成提供了多维度控制框架，通过激活空间方向性建模与文本条件的协同作用，实现了全局与局部特征的联合调控。

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Result: 实验表明：延迟集成增强上下文关联性；注意力子模块单独即可有效探测音频信息；多编码器集成显著扩展信息覆盖范围。最终整合所有优化的架构相对基线实现10%-60%性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过系统化架构设计（延迟集成、注意力子模块专用化、多编码器融合），验证了跨模态信息传递的优化路径，为音频-LLM的高效交互机制提供了可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

TL;DR: 本文提出BNMusic框架，通过生成与用户文本提示相关的个性化音乐，将环境噪音融入其中，结合自适应放大技术，有效降低噪音感知并提升听觉体验。


<details>

Motivation: 传统声学掩蔽技术因主导声音与噪音节奏不匹配需过度增大音量，导致效果受限。受跨模态生成启发，探索通过生成与噪音特征匹配的个性化音乐实现更自然的噪音混合。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 基于梅尔频谱图生成包含噪音音乐特征的自定义音乐；2) 自适应放大生成音乐以优化噪音混合效果，同时保持音质。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成节奏对齐、可自适应调节的音乐片段，显著降低噪音可察觉性。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架通过跨模态生成与自适应放大技术，实现了环境噪音与个性化音乐的有效融合，为声学体验优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件开发中，代码问题检测与修复依赖人工，效率低且资源消耗大。研究旨在通过LLMs与静态分析结合，自动化这一流程，减少人工干预并提升代码质量。

Method: 1. 静态分析框架检测代码问题；2. 通过迭代式提示工程优化LLM输出；3. 引入RAG增强上下文相关性；4. 开发代码比对工具纠正LLM幻觉导致的错误修改。

Result: 静态分析复检显示代码问题显著减少，验证了LLMs结合静态分析、RAG及纠错工具在提升代码质量、降低开发成本方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LLMs与静态分析、RAG的集成可高效自动化代码问题修复，减少开发时间与资源消耗，但需通过技术手段（如纠错工具）缓解模型幻觉风险。

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码质量高度依赖用户输入的提示质量，而用户背景差异（如软件开发经验）可能导致生成结果显著不同。因此需量化LLM对输入的敏感性，以提升生成代码的可靠性。

Method: 提出两种独立于具体编程任务和LLM的评估方法：1) 合成代码生成评估流程；2) 基于用户角色（persona）的系统性评估框架，用于分析不同背景用户对生成结果的影响。

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效暴露LLM生成代码的定性差异，并公开了相关代码供社区使用。

Conclusion: 该评估方法具有任务/模型无关性，可广泛应用于优化LLM代码生成质量，同时强调了用户背景因素在提示设计中的重要性。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

*Surya Jasper,Minh Luu,Evan Pan,Aakash Tyagi,Michael Quinn,Jiang Hu,David Kebo Houngninou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BugGen利用多智能体LLM管道自动生成高质量RTL功能错误数据集，验证效率较人工提升5倍，并能有效暴露测试平台盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件复杂度增加导致验证资源紧张，现有错误注入方法无法可靠生成多样化错误数据集，制约机器学习辅助调试的发展。

Method: 通过模块划分+闭环智能体架构选择变异目标，采用迭代优化与回滚机制保证语法正确性和功能可检测性的多智能体LLM管道系统。

Result: 在OpenTitan IP模块中生成500个独特错误（94%功能准确率），每小时验证17.7个错误，发现104个回归测试未覆盖错误，ML分类准确率达88.1%-93.2%。

Conclusion: BugGen为验证流程提供了可扩展的高质量错误数据集生成方案，在语法准确性、错误复杂度和测试覆盖缺陷暴露方面显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究首次通过大规模分析89.4万条AI移动应用用户评论，开发多阶段分析流程，揭示用户对AI功能的核心关注点：正面评价聚焦生产力与可靠性，负面反馈集中于技术故障、定价及语言限制，并发现传统方法易忽略同一评论中的情感共存现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI功能在移动应用中快速普及，但用户对其感知与评价尚未被系统研究。海量用户反馈导致分析困难，需开发高效方法以挖掘真实用户体验。

Method: 构建含292个AI应用的跨14类数据集，设计多阶段分析流程（含人工标注基准与LLM验证），通过分类、方面-情感提取及聚类三阶段确保分析精度与一致性。

Result: 提取超百万条情感-主题对，聚类为18正向/15负向主题。用户关注点集中：正面强调生产力与个性化，负面聚焦技术故障与定价。方法可捕捉同一评论中正负情感共存，分类分析揭示通用满意度驱动因素及领域特定问题。

Conclusion: 所提流程能更真实反映用户对AI应用的复杂体验，揭示传统粗粒度分析易遗漏的细粒度情感共存现象，为优化AI功能设计提供数据驱动洞见。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

TL;DR: 提出SWE-Factory自动化流水线，通过多智能体环境构建、标准化评分和自动验证，高效生成GitHub问题解决数据集，显著降低人工成本并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统构建大规模GitHub问题解决数据集的过程存在环境搭建、测试结果评估和任务实例验证等环节的高人工成本与低效问题，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 集成SWE-Builder多智能体系统（含环境记忆池）、基于退出码的标准化评分方法及自动化fail2pass验证，实现全流程自动化。

Result: 在4种编程语言的671个问题上，SWE-Builder以最低0.024美元/实例成本构建有效实例；退出码评分准确率100%，fail2pass验证精确度0.92、召回率1.00。

Conclusion: SWE-Factory通过全自动化流程显著提升数据集构建效率与质量，为LLM软件工程能力训练与评估提供可靠数据支持，相关代码与数据已开源。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

### [287] [AI5GTest: AI-Driven Specification-Aware Automated Testing and Validation of 5G O-RAN Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10111)
*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 提出AI5GTest框架，利用协作式大语言模型(LLM)自动化验证O-RAN组件的合规性，显著降低测试时间并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN的开放架构导致多厂商组件测试复杂度激增，现有OTICs框架依赖人工流程存在碎片化、易出错和扩展性差的问题，需开发自动化测试解决方案。

Method: 构建Gen-LLM/Val-LLM/Debug-LLM三层协作框架：Gen-LLM基于规范生成测试流程，Val-LLM验证信令合规性，Debug-LLM进行根因分析，并引入人机协同机制提升可信度。

Result: 基于O-RAN TIFG/WG5-IOT测试规范的实验表明，相比传统方法显著缩短测试执行时间，同时保持高验证准确率。

Conclusion: AI5GTest通过LLM协同架构与规范驱动验证机制，有效应对O-RAN多厂商环境下的自动化测试挑战，为6G网络测试提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于硬件感知神经架构搜索的轻量级1D-CNN模型，在资源受限的物联网微控制器上实现高精度、低能耗的加密流量分类，量化后仅损失1-2%准确率，在STM32和Nucleo开发板分别实现7.86mJ/29.10mJ单次推理能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备受限于计算资源与能耗约束，需在保持流量分类精度的同时实现模型轻量化部署，平衡准确性、计算效率与实际部署可行性。

Method: 采用硬件感知神经架构搜索(HW-NAS)优化1D-CNN结构，通过INT8量化压缩模型，参数规模仅88.26K，最大张量20.12K，计算量10.08M FLOPs，适配不同微控制器硬件特性。

Result: ISCX数据集准确率96.59%，跨任务泛化能力94-99%；量化后精度损失<2%；STM32F746G/Nucleo-F401RE推理延迟31.43ms/115.40ms，能耗7.86mJ/29.10mJ。

Conclusion: 验证了边缘设备加密流量实时分析的可行性，为可扩展低功耗物联网安全方案提供技术路径，证明硬件协同优化模型在资源受限场景的实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security
solutions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义代理层和MCP/A2A协议的新型月球无线通信系统扩展方案，通过分布式认知代理实现上下文感知决策与动态协调策略，以解决现有Space-O-RAN静态策略及语义集成不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球表面无线通信需满足自主性、抗干扰性及环境适应性要求，但现有Space-O-RAN系统依赖静态策略且缺乏语义集成，无法适应动态任务场景。

Method: 引入由MCP协议和A2A通信支持的语义代理层，在实时/近实时/非实时控制层间实现上下文感知决策，并通过部署于设备端的认知代理执行延迟自适应推理、带宽感知语义压缩等策略。

Result: 系统能动态协调遥测数据、移动规划与任务约束，实现无线感知的跨层协作，提升通信系统对复杂月球任务场景的适应能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的语义代理架构显著增强了月球通信系统的自主决策与动态适应性，为未来深空任务提供了可扩展的智能通信框架。

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将Levy的按值调用λ演算（CBPV）编码到π演算的方法，并证明其可靠性与完备性。通过使用内部π演算（pi-i-calculus）规避形式化中的de Bruijn索引问题，同时满足Gorla的编码质量标准，并与Milner的编码进行对比。部分证明通过Coq形式化，未完全验证的引理通过手工证明支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CBPV在π演算中形式化编码的挑战，特别是de Bruijn索引带来的复杂性，同时探索不同π演算变体（如异步多元π演算、局部π演算）的编码可能性，并建立编码的理论基础。

Method: 1. 采用内部π演算（pi-i-calculus）简化形式化过程；2. 通过非正式手工证明验证可靠性与完备性；3. 结合Coq对部分证明进行形式化；4. 分析编码对Gorla标准的符合性及与Milner编码的相似性。

Result: 成功定义CBPV到π-i-calculus的编码，证明其可靠且完备，满足Gorla的五项标准。不同π演算变体的编码实现展示了方法的通用性，Coq形式化验证初步支持了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该编码方法在理论层面有效，且形式化验证的可行性得到初步验证。未完全形式化的引理通过手工证明合理化，为后续完整形式化奠定了基础，同时扩展了π演算对高级计算模型的表达能力。

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出StepProof方法，通过将自然语言证明分解为可逐句验证的子证明，解决了现有自动形式化方法无法进行细粒度验证的问题，显著提升了验证成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式定理证明器（ITPs）缺乏自然语言接口，现有自动形式化方法仅支持完整证明的验证，无法实现句子级细粒度验证。

Method: StepProof将完整证明拆解为多个可独立验证的子证明，支持逐句形式化验证，并通过人工微调自然语言证明优化性能。

Result: 实验表明StepProof在验证成功率和效率上优于传统方法，且人工微调后的自然语言证明可进一步提升其表现。

Conclusion: StepProof通过细粒度验证机制有效弥补了自动形式化技术的局限性，为数学证明的形式化验证提供了更灵活可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了高维噪声数据下单纯形学习的样本复杂度，提出了基于信噪比的上界和匹配下界，解决了信噪比足够高时复杂度与无噪声情况一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高维单纯形学习在噪声场景下的样本复杂度缺乏理论保障，需建立信息论下界并分析信噪比对复杂度的影响。

Method: 结合样本压缩技术(Ashtiani et al., 2018)与新型傅里叶方法，推导信息论下界并设计噪声分布恢复算法。

Result: 证明TV距离ε估计需要Ω(K³σ²/ε² + K/ε)样本下界；当SNR≥Ω(√K)时噪声复杂度与无噪声情况Ω(K/ε)一致。

Conclusion: 首次建立噪声单纯形学习的紧致下界，提出的傅里叶方法可推广至更广泛分布恢复问题，解决了信噪比阈值对复杂度影响的开放性问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相邻快照成对插值的方法（如Bridge和Flow matching）难以捕捉复杂系统的长程时间依赖性，且可能影响推断轨迹的连贯性。

Method: 提出动量多边际薛定谔桥匹配框架（3MSBM），将动态提升至相空间，通过多边际条件随机桥形成最优控制问题，并最小化变分目标学习动态过程，同时保持训练中中间边际的传输映射。

Result: 在真实场景的广泛实验中，3MSBM相比现有方法在捕捉具有时间依赖性的复杂动态方面表现更优，且显著提升了收敛速度和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 3MSBM为多边际场景下的匹配框架训练开辟了新途径，验证了其在保持中间边际约束下建模复杂系统动态的有效性。

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于分布约束对手的在线学习框架，统一并扩展了对抗性与随机性环境之间的学习理论，分析了不同分布类下的可学习性条件，并证明部分函数类（如线性分类器）无需先验知识即可适应此类约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究试图通过平滑分析等框架连接在线学习的对抗与随机场景，但缺乏对更广泛分布约束的通用分析。本文旨在建立更灵活的分布约束对手框架，以细粒度刻画介于完全随机与完全对抗之间的可学习场景。

Method: 采用分布约束对手框架，通过定义受约束的分布类，分析对手在分布选择上的限制，并针对遗忘型与适应型对手，结合函数类与分布约束的交互关系，建立可学习性的理论特征。

Result: 理论结果表明：1）可学习性取决于分布类与函数类的交互；2）推广了平滑分析的可学习结果；3）线性分类器等自然函数类无需预知分布类即可对抗约束对手。

Conclusion: 分布约束对手框架为在线学习提供了统一的理论工具，扩展了对抗-随机连续统的分析边界，并揭示了部分函数类在无先验知识下的强适应能力。

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种信息论方法，用于测量扩散模型生成过程中类别语义决策的时间点，发现不同类别的语义决策发生在不同中间阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成图像时，语义和结构特征在不同阶段涌现，类似物理相变现象。研究旨在量化这些语义决策的发生时机，以理解生成过程的动态机制。

Method: 通过贝叶斯分类器的在线公式估计噪声状态下类别标签的条件熵，利用条件熵的时间导数确定信息传递最高的时段。实验涵盖一维高斯混合模型和CIFAR10训练的DDPM模型。

Result: 语义信息传递在扩散中期达到峰值，末期趋近于零；不同类别的熵率分布差异显著，表明其语义决策时间存在异质性。

Conclusion: 扩散生成过程中，语义决策并非均匀分布，而是依类别在特定中间阶段集中发生，揭示了生成动态的复杂性与类别依赖性。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"

### [296] [Box-Constrained Softmax Function and Its Application for Post-Hoc Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10572)
*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于盒约束的Softmax函数（BCSoftmax），通过显式约束输出概率的上下界，解决了传统Softmax无法施加硬约束的问题，并开发了高效计算算法。基于BCSoftmax的后处理校准方法有效缓解了预测模型的欠自信/过自信问题，实验在多个数据集上验证了校准指标的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax函数通过温度参数实现软控制，但无法对输出概率施加硬约束（如上下界约束），而硬约束对构建可靠可信的机器学习模型（如安全敏感场景）至关重要。

Method: 提出BCSoftmax函数作为Softmax的泛化形式，通过盒约束优化问题显式约束概率上下界，并设计精确高效的计算算法。进一步开发两种后处理校准方法，通过训练后学习概率/逻辑值的上下界实现校准。

Result: 在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups数据集上的实验表明，所提方法显著改善了校准指标，有效平衡了预测置信度的欠自信/过自信问题。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax通过硬约束机制扩展了Softmax的功能，其配套校准方法增强了模型可靠性，为需要可信预测的下游任务提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

### [297] [Logarithmic Smoothing for Adaptive PAC-Bayesian Off-Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10664)
*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应离策略学习方法，通过扩展PAC-Bayesian理论框架，结合在线学习与对数平滑估计器，实现多轮策略迭代优化，并在动态数据收集中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离策略学习依赖静态行为策略收集的日志数据，缺乏灵活性。研究旨在探索更实用的自适应场景，通过迭代优化策略并重新部署以获取更高质量数据。

Method: 基于静态场景中PAC-Bayesian对数平滑方法，利用在线PAC-Bayesian理论扩展至自适应场景，调整对数平滑估计器以支持多轮策略部署，并在温和条件下加速收敛。

Result: 方法在静态设置中与主流离线方法性能相当，在允许中间策略部署时显著优于后者。实验验证了自适应数据收集的优势及PAC-Bayesian框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 自适应数据收集机制与改进的PAC-Bayesian方法结合，为动态策略优化提供了高效解决方案，尤其在多轮部署场景中展现出优越性。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

*Sakhi Otmane,Gilotte Alexandre,Rohde David*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的无偏离策略估计器家族，用于改进A/B测试中的均值差异估计器，在系统版本相似时显著降低方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统A/B测试中使用的均值差异估计器虽无偏，但方差较高，尤其在测试系统版本相似时效率不足，需开发更优估计方法。

Method: 构建无偏离策略估计器家族，通过理论分析筛选出方差最小的特定估计器，利用系统间相似性实现方差缩减。

Result: 理论证明与实验表明，新估计器在系统版本相似时方差显著低于传统方法，且保持无偏性，实际应用效果稳定。

Conclusion: 所提估计器结构简单，能有效提升A/B测试精度，特别适用于相似系统对比场景，具有较高实用价值。

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit
similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在存在隐藏混淆因素时，使用非参数工具变量（IV）回归进行因果效应估计的方法，提出了基于谱特征的两阶段最小二乘估计器，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其性能与失败模式的分类（好、坏、丑场景）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果效应估计中，隐藏混淆因素的存在会干扰结果准确性。传统方法依赖参数假设，而非参数工具变量方法虽灵活但缺乏对性能的系统分析。本文旨在通过谱特征分析，明确方法在不同场景下的表现与限制。

Method: 采用非参数工具变量回归，利用谱特征（即工具变量与治疗变量间算子的顶部特征子空间）构建两阶段最小二乘估计器，并通过泛化误差界分析其性能。

Result: 提出三种场景分类：1）好场景（强谱对齐+慢特征值衰减）下方法最优；2）坏场景（强谱对齐+快特征值衰减）需更多样本；3）丑场景（弱谱对齐）方法失效。合成实验验证了该分类。

Conclusion: 谱对齐强度与工具变量的强度（特征值衰减速度）共同决定非参数IV回归的性能。方法在谱对齐强时有效，但需工具变量足够强（特征值衰减慢），否则性能下降或失效。

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Motivation: 高质量标注数据集成本高昂，需大量人工或昂贵实验，需寻求更经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 利用预训练模型的AI预测补充专家标注，通过概率近似正确（PAC）理论保证整体标注误差可控。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用现代模型实现高效严格的数据集标注提供了理论支持，降低标注成本同时保持可靠性。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [301] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了带分类器无关指导（CFG）的掩码离散扩散模型，推导了引导反向动力学的显式解，揭示了指导强度对采样分布和协方差结构的影响，并分析了不同维度下的行为差异及总变差衰减特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分类器无关指导（CFG）在离散扩散模型中的作用机制，特别是指导如何通过调整采样动态和分布结构来增强特定类别的生成效果。

Method: 假设无评分误差和离散化误差，推导引导反向动力学的显式解，分析指导强度$w$对协方差结构的影响，并通过实验验证理论结果。

Result: 指导强度$w$会放大目标类别的区域并抑制共享区域，1D与2D场景下行为差异显著；大$w$时总变差（TV）衰减率随$w$呈双指数变化。

Conclusion: 指导不仅调整输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动态特性，其几何效应和收敛影响通过理论分析与实验得到验证。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练扩散模型作为生成先验整合到全波形反演（FWI）中的方法，通过分数重匹配策略避免反向扩散采样，减少迭代次数，直接在干净图像空间操作，提升反演质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在逆问题中需完整反向扩散过程并处理含噪中间状态，导致计算地震成像不稳定，尤其在非线性FWI中，噪声速度场易引发数值伪影和低质量反演。

Method: 将预训练去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为基于分数的生成先验，通过分数重匹配策略直接嵌入FWI，无需反向扩散采样，仅需在标准FWI更新规则中引入正则化项，最小化现有流程改动。

Result: 数值实验表明，相比传统及基于GAN的FWI方法，该方法在保真度、鲁棒性上表现更优，同时保持实用性与计算效率。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过稳定波传播和改善收敛性，显著提升FWI的反演质量，为地震成像及其他逆问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Motivation: 开发一种自动化方法，利用雷达数据及电离层电波传播模型，解决电离层散射雷达数据处理中分类的复杂性问题，减少人工干预并提高分类效率。

Method: 整合雷达实测数据、电离层电波传播自动建模结果及模型质量数学评估标准，使用12个雷达的两年数据训练含2669个系数的模型，并通过流星尾迹散射信号校准仰角测量。

Result: 确定37个数据类别（25类常见，14类可明确区分），初步解释其中10类；分类动态与地理纬度和地磁活动相关且符合物理机制，关键分类特征为射线轨迹后半段形状、散射高度和雷达多普勒速度。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效分类电离层散射雷达数据，分类结果与物理机制一致，关键参数验证了模型的合理性，为后续电离层现象研究提供了自动化分析基础。

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练、模型无关的框架RAAI，通过检测LLMs的内部拒绝信号并注入预定义短语，生成有害但流畅的合成数据，用于提升模型安全对齐效果。实验表明RAAI显著提高有害响应率，且微调后的模型在保持通用能力的同时增强了抗攻击鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs安全对齐方法依赖大量人工标注的偏好数据，成本高昂且效率低下。虽然合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法通常需要复杂迭代提示或辅助模型，亟需更简单高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection（RAAI）框架：通过检测模型内部拒绝信号，自适应注入预定义短语，诱导生成有害但流畅的补全内容，无需额外训练且适用于不同模型。

Result: RAAI将有害响应率从基线2.15%提升至平均61.04%。使用RAAI生成数据微调的模型在MMLU和ARC等标准任务中保持性能，同时显著增强对有害提示的防御能力。

Conclusion: RAAI成功将LLM攻击技术转化为安全对齐工具，证明通过合成数据可扩展且可控地提升模型安全性，为高效安全训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究提出MalwareBench基准数据集，评估大型语言模型（LLM）在代码生成任务中抵御越狱攻击的能力，发现主流模型对恶意代码请求的拒绝率较低，且组合攻击方法会进一步削弱安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLM的通用安全能力，但其在代码生成场景下对越狱攻击的脆弱性尚未充分探索。需系统性评估模型在此类威胁中的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建包含3,520个恶意代码生成提示的MalwareBench数据集，覆盖11种越狱方法和29种代码功能类别，基于320个手动设计的恶意需求进行实验验证。

Result: 主流LLM对恶意代码的平均拒绝率为60.93%，结合越狱攻击算法后骤降至39.92%，表明模型安全防护存在显著漏洞。

Conclusion: LLM在代码生成中的安全防御能力面临严峻挑战，需针对性改进模型对组合越狱攻击的识别与阻断机制。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出私有记忆编辑（PME）方法，通过检测并编辑大语言模型中的个人身份信息（PII）记忆，将模型的记忆能力转化为隐私防御机制，有效减少隐私数据泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）可能记忆未受控数据中的个人身份信息（PII），导致隐私泄露风险。现有攻击利用模型对训练数据的记忆特性，需开发针对性防御策略。

Method: PME方法分两步：1）检测模型已记忆的PII；2）通过编辑模型对训练数据的知识，消除PII记忆，同时保持模型语言能力不受影响。

Result: 实验表明PME显著减少PII泄露，部分场景使隐私攻击准确率降至0%，且不损害模型基础性能。

Conclusion: PME成功将LLMs的记忆特性转化为隐私防御优势，增强模型对训练数据提取攻击的鲁棒性，为隐私保护提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG平台水印技术仅保护文本知识，而服务化多模态RAG系统中图像知识缺乏有效版权保护方案。

Method: 采用首字母触发器和空间关系线索双通道方法，将语义水印嵌入合成图像，确保水印在图像检索到文本生成的跨模态传播中持续存活。

Result: 跨模型/数据集的实验表明，AQUA水印具备强鲁棒性(存活率>95%)、高隐蔽性(PSNR>40dB)和可靠溯源性(检测率>90%)。

Conclusion: AQUA填补了多模态RAG系统图像知识保护的空白，为服务化平台贡献数据确权提供了关键技术支撑。

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

TL;DR: 本文提出GenBreak框架，通过微调红队大语言模型生成对抗性提示，有效绕过商业文本生成图像模型的安全机制并生成高毒性内容，揭示现有模型的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法存在局限性：部分生成的对抗提示易被安全过滤器拦截，另一些虽能绕过安全机制但无法生成真正有害内容，导致缺乏可靠工具评估防御后T2I模型的安全性。

Method: 结合监督微调（基于标注数据集）与强化学习（通过代理T2I模型交互），集成多奖励信号指导LLM生成兼具规避能力、高毒性、语义连贯性和多样化的对抗提示。

Result: 生成的对抗提示在黑盒攻击中显著有效，成功攻击商业T2I生成器，暴露实际安全隐患。

Conclusion: GenBreak框架系统性探索T2I模型的潜在漏洞，为评估模型安全性提供可靠工具，同时揭示当前防御机制的实践缺陷。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Method: 设计CMPL框架：采用迭代式多轮对话探测策略，模拟真实交互场景，结合量化风险指标与开放基准测试隐私漏洞。

Result: 实验表明CMPL能跨领域/模态/安全配置揭示单轮防御无法检测的隐私风险，验证框架有效性。

Conclusion: CMPL为对话隐私审计提供诊断工具，其量化指标与开放基准可推动LLM代理隐私保护机制优化。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现部分机器学习去学习方法在简单攻击下失效，评估了8种方法后发现部分方法（如ELM）易受特定提示攻击，需更可靠评估框架区分真实知识移除与表面输出抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证现有去学习方法在提示攻击下的实际效果，挑战关于去学习有效性的普遍假设，强调需更严谨的评估标准。

Method: 系统评估三种模型家族的8种去学习技术，采用输出分析、logit分析和探针分析，设计包含印地语填充文本等提示攻击方法。

Result: RMU/TAR方法稳健，而ELM在特定提示下恢复57.3%准确率；logit分析证实未通过修改输出格式隐藏知识，输出与logit准确率强相关。

Conclusion: 现有去学习效果评估存在缺陷，需开发能检测真实知识移除的框架，并公开了支持提示攻击测试的评估工具。

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了微调大型语言模型（LLM）在成员推理攻击（MIA）中的隐私风险，并提出防御方法SOFT，通过选择性数据混淆平衡隐私保护与模型性能。实验表明SOFT能有效降低隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLM时可能涉及敏感信息，导致隐私泄露风险。现有研究缺乏对成员推理攻击（MIA）的系统评估，需开发兼顾隐私与效用的防御方法。

Method: 提出SOFT方法：基于影响力数据选择进行选择性混淆，通过可调参数控制隐私保护与模型效用的平衡，适用于不同领域、架构和规模的LLM。

Result: 跨六领域、多模型架构的实验表明，SOFT显著降低隐私风险（MIA攻击成功率下降），同时保持模型性能（与基线模型竞争力相当）。

Conclusion: SOFT为微调LLM提供了一种可扩展的隐私保护方案，通过动态权衡隐私与效用，为实际应用中敏感信息处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统在特定领域（如网络安全）的应用潜力，提出系统化规范以评估其联合推理、代码生成与执行能力，并通过测试案例验证架构可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多单独评估LLM、推理技术或应用，缺乏对多智能体系统联合应用的系统化规范与评估，需明确其组合潜力及适用场景。

Method: 扩展已有系统架构与原型，提出多智能体系统规范，设计网络安全任务测试案例，结合OpenAI和DeepSeek的LLM代理进行实验。

Result: 测试表明，基于LLM的代理能正确完成网络安全相关问答、服务器及网络防护任务，验证了架构与评估方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统规范有助于系统化评估其综合能力，网络安全案例证明其应用潜力，但需进一步研究优化联合推理与执行机制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM防护机制（guardrails）分散且缺乏统一评估标准，导致安全漏洞（如越狱攻击）防御效果难以有效衡量与优化。

Method: 提出基于六个维度的新型分类法，并设计安全-效率-实用性评估框架，通过实验分析不同防护机制在攻击类型中的通用性与组合效果。

Result: 实验表明现有防护机制在特定场景下有效但存在局限性，不同防御组合可优化效果，且防护方法对攻击类型具有选择性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM防护机制的研究与部署提供了结构化基础，推动安全防御向系统化、高效化方向发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出TED-LaST方法，通过标签监督动态跟踪和自适应层强调增强拓扑演化动力学（TED）的鲁棒性，有效防御针对DNN的复杂自适应后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于TED的后门攻击检测方法在面对自适应攻击（如扭曲拓扑表示分布）时存在脆弱性，需提升其对动态恶意任务的防御能力。

Method: 引入TED-LaST策略，结合标签监督动态跟踪和自适应层强调技术，并针对自适应攻击提出增强型目标映射攻击以验证防御效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GTSRB、ImageNet100数据集及ResNet等模型上，TED-LaST成功抵御Adap-Blend、Adapt-Patch等先进攻击，检测准确率显著优于传统TED。

Conclusion: TED-LaST通过创新性拓扑动态分析机制，为DNN后门检测建立了新基准，显著提升了对抗自适应攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文针对生成扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的版权侵权攻击问题，提出新数据集及基于SilentBadDiffusion（SBD）的多元素（ME）攻击方法，结合离散余弦变换（DCT）提升攻击效果与隐蔽性。实验显示，新方法在低毒样本条件下显著优于原SBD，部分指标接近或超越现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法SBD在毒样本数量较少时效果不佳，且相关数据集因版权或内容问题受限，部分图像不适用于攻击研究。需开发更高效攻击方法并扩展可用数据资源。

Method: 提出适用于攻击研究的新数据集，并基于SBD设计多元素攻击（ME），通过增加单样本的毒视觉-文本元素提升攻击能力，同时引入DCT保持毒样本隐蔽性。

Result: 在两个新数据集上，CIR/FAE分别达16.78%/39.50和51.20%/23.60，接近或超越基准数据集。低采样率（5%）时，MESI+DCT的CIR/FAE为0.23%/84.00和12.73%/65.50，均优于原SBD（攻击失败）。

Conclusion: ME攻击结合DCT显著提升生成扩散模型的版权侵权攻击效果，尤其在低毒样本条件下表现优越，新数据集为相关研究提供有效支持。

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出一种针对Tree-Ring水印技术的新型攻击方法，仅需利用公开的变分自编码器即可显著降低检测器性能，暴露现有行业实践的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对Tree-Ring水印的移除攻击依赖过强的攻击者假设，而实际攻击者可能仅需访问训练扩散模型时使用的公开自编码器。本文旨在探索基于此弱假设条件的攻击可行性。

Method: 通过复用目标扩散模型训练时使用的公开变分自编码器，近似模型中间潜在空间，构建更有效的代理模型进行攻击。该方法无需完整扩散模型访问权限。

Result: 攻击使Tree-Ring检测器的ROC-AUC从0.993降至0.153，PR-AUC从0.994降至0.385，且图像质量保持高位。攻击效果优于需完整模型权限的现有方法。

Conclusion: 重用公共自编码器训练扩散模型存在重大安全风险，且Tree-Ring检测器的精确度指标未达实际部署要求。当前行业实践需重新评估相关威胁模型。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于梯度的对抗攻击在不同知识程度（白盒、灰盒、黑盒）下对汽车CAN总线入侵检测系统（IDS）的可行性与影响，发现攻击效果受数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者知识水平共同制约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆CAN总线缺乏强安全机制，且随着车辆互联性增强，易受网络攻击。现有入侵检测系统（IDS）虽能防御威胁，但对抗攻击（如规避攻击）可通过输入篡改绕过检测，需系统性评估其实际可行性及影响。

Method: 在三种攻击场景（白盒、灰盒、黑盒）下，针对公开数据集上的先进IDS，测试梯度对抗攻击效果；分析对抗扰动对攻击的影响，并通过预计算规避载荷评估实时注入的可行性。

Result: 实验表明，攻击有效性高度依赖数据集质量、目标IDS类型及攻击者知识水平。黑盒场景下攻击更具挑战性，但通过总线流量时序分析预计算载荷仍可实现实时规避。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击对汽车IDS构成实际威胁，其成功与否受多因素影响。研究强调需提升IDS鲁棒性，并考虑不同攻击场景下的防御策略，尤其在数据质量和系统透明度受限的汽车领域。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 当前LLM安全防御无法抵御分解攻击，本文提出轻量级序列监控框架，成功防御率达93%，成本降低90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐技术仅检测即时提示的恶意内容，无法识别通过分解良性子任务形成的长期恶意行为，导致GPT-4o等模型平均攻击成功率高达87%。

Method: 提出外部监控器，在更高粒度上观察对话流；构建包含问答、文生图、代理任务的最大分解攻击数据集；设计轻量级序列监控框架实时累积评估子任务。

Result: 轻量级监控器防御成功率达93%，优于o3 mini等推理模型；可抵御随机任务注入攻击，成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级序列监控器能有效缓解分解攻击，验证了部署可行性，同时证明随机任务注入会进一步模糊恶意意图。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.
