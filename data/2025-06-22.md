### [1] [Adverse Event Extraction from Discharge Summaries: A New Dataset, Annotation Scheme, and Initial Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14900)
*Imane Guellil,Salomé Andres,Atul Anand,Bruce Guthrie,Huayu Zhang,Abul Hasan,Honghan Wu,Beatrice Alex*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究构建了一个针对老年患者出院摘要中不良事件（AE）提取的手工标注语料库，评估了多种模型在不同粒度标注上的性能，发现尽管在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但在细粒度任务和罕见事件检测上仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 老年患者在临床自然语言处理（NLP）资源中代表性不足，且现有研究很少处理不连续和重叠实体的标注挑战。

Method: 研究使用FlairNLP评估了多种模型（如BERT-cased）在三个标注粒度（细粒度、粗粒度和带否定的粗粒度）上的性能。

Result: 基于Transformer的模型在文档级粗粒度提取上表现优异（F1 = 0.943），但在细粒度实体级任务上表现显著下降（F1 = 0.675），尤其是罕见事件和复杂属性。

Conclusion: 尽管在高层任务上表现良好，但在检测代表性不足的不良事件和捕捉细微临床语言方面仍存在显著挑战。该数据集可作为评估AE提取方法和支持未来跨数据集泛化的基准。

Abstract: In this work, we present a manually annotated corpus for Adverse Event (AE)
extraction from discharge summaries of elderly patients, a population often
underrepresented in clinical NLP resources. The dataset includes 14 clinically
significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along
with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital
occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and
overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We
evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities:
fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While
transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on
document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops
notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly
for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite
high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented
AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted
Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch
and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and
supporting future cross-dataset generalisation.

### [2] [Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14901)
*Marija Šakota,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BoostCD方法，通过结合约束和非约束解码提升结构化NLP任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在测试时约束解码可能导致低质量输出，需改进。

Method: BoostCD分两阶段：基础模型分别进行约束/非约束解码，再由增强模型融合结果。

Result: BoostIE模型在封闭信息抽取任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BoostCD有效利用互补错误提升结构化输出质量。

Abstract: Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language
model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing
structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the
desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training,
these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which
are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it
allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to
low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this
problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained
and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model
$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak
predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the
two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base
model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted
model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of
BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE,
outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing
several common errors identified in those approaches.

### [3] [CrEst: Credibility Estimation for Contexts in LLMs via Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14912)
*Dyah Adila,Shuai Zhang,Boran Han,Bonan Min,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CrEst框架，通过弱监督方法评估上下文文档的可信度，无需人工标注，显著提升LLM在知识密集型任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽视上下文文档的可信度差异，可能导致不可靠信息传播。需自动化评估文档可信度以提升模型可靠性。

Method: 基于文档间语义一致性自动评估可信度，提出黑盒（无内部权重访问）和白盒（修改注意力机制）两种集成策略。

Result: 在3种模型架构和5个数据集上，CrEst准确率最高提升26.86%，F1分数提高3.49%，且在高噪声下表现稳健。

Conclusion: CrEst通过自动化文档可信度评估有效提升LLM性能，为上下文可靠性问题提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of contextual information has significantly enhanced the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility
of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of
unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly
supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during
LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded
in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic
coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility
estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into
LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for
models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box
method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst
consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement
in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score. Further analysis shows that CrEst
maintains robust performance even under high-noise conditions.

### [4] [MDBench: A Synthetic Multi-Document Reasoning Benchmark Generated with Knowledge Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14927)
*Joseph J. Peper,Wenzhao Qiu,Ali Payani,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MDBench数据集，通过合成生成方法评估大语言模型在多文档推理任务中的表现，发现现有方法面临显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）推理能力的快速提升，多文档（MD）推理领域的评估基准需求日益迫切。然而，由于长文本标注成本高昂，现有基准稀缺。

Method: 采用新型合成生成技术，基于结构化种子知识，通过LLM辅助编辑生成多文档推理挑战，并转换为自然文本形式的文档集及对应QA样本。

Result: 实验表明，即使文档集较短，MDBench对所有流行LLM和提示技术均构成显著挑战。知识引导生成技术能针对性分析MD推理能力，并快速适应新挑战。

Conclusion: MDBench填补了多文档推理评估的空白，其高效可控的生成方法为未来模型改进提供了灵活工具。

Abstract: Natural language processing evaluation has made significant progress, largely
driven by the proliferation of powerful large language mod-els (LLMs). New
evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD)
reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling
longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model
behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically
challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long
inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs
on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a
novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently
generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA)
examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge,
modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning
challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text
surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We
analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that
MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively
short document sets. We also see our knowledge-guided generation technique (1)
allows us to readily perform targeted analysis of MD-specific reasoning
capabilities and (2) can be adapted quickly to account for new challenges and
future modeling improvements.

### [5] [From Chat to Checkup: Can Large Language Models Assist in Diabetes Prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14949)
*Shadman Sakib,Oishy Fatema Akhand,Ajwad Abrar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在糖尿病预测中的应用，比较了开源和专有模型的表现，并发现专有模型在少量样本设置下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和深度学习模型已广泛用于糖尿病预测，但大型语言模型（LLMs）在结构化数值数据上的应用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在评估LLMs在此任务中的有效性。

Method: 研究使用Pima印第安人糖尿病数据库（PIDD），测试了六种LLMs（包括开源和专有模型）在零样本、单样本和三样本提示方法下的表现，并与传统机器学习模型进行对比。

Result: 结果显示，专有LLMs表现优于开源模型，GPT-4o和Gemma-2-27B在少量样本设置中准确率最高。Gemma-2-27B的F1分数还超过了传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可用于医疗预测任务，未来可通过提示工程和混合方法进一步提升其在健康预测中的表现。

Abstract: While Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have been widely
used for diabetes prediction, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
structured numerical data is still not well explored. In this study, we test
the effectiveness of LLMs in predicting diabetes using zero-shot, one-shot, and
three-shot prompting methods. We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima
Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four
open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We
also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we
compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results
show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o
and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably,
Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.
However, there are still issues such as performance variation across prompting
strategies and the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. This study shows that
LLMs can be useful for medical prediction tasks and encourages future work on
prompt engineering and hybrid approaches to improve healthcare predictions.

### [6] [Memory Tokens: Large Language Models Can Generate Reversible Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15001)
*Ignacio Sastre,Aiala Rosá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现无需修改模型权重，通过特殊记忆令牌即可让LLM精确重建原始文本，适用于多语言和大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）在不调整权重的情况下，通过特定方法实现精确文本重建的能力。

Method: 引入特殊记忆令牌，通过固定序列训练优化其嵌入，使模型能根据提示准确重建原始文本。

Result: 在英语和西班牙语数据集上，模型（包括Llama 3.1 8B）成功重建了长达240个标记的序列。

Conclusion: 该能力为基于记忆的检索、压缩和受控文本生成等应用提供了潜在可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon: it is possible to
generate reversible sentence embeddings that allow an LLM to reconstruct the
original text exactly, without modifying the model's weights. This is achieved
by introducing a special memory token, whose embedding is optimized through
training on a fixed sequence. When prompted with this embedding, the model
reconstructs the fixed sequence exactly. We evaluate this phenomenon across
English and Spanish datasets, sequences of up to approximately 240 tokens, and
model scales ranging from 100M to 8B parameters. Notably, Llama 3.1 8B
successfully reconstructs all tested sequences. Our findings highlight an
interesting capability of LLMs and suggest potential applications in
memory-based retrieval, compression, and controlled text generation.

### [7] [Identifying social isolation themes in NVDRS text narratives using topic modeling and text-classification methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15030)
*Drew Walker,Swati Rajwal,Sudeshna Das,Snigdha Peddireddy,Abeed Sarker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理技术分析自杀案例中的社会隔离与孤独感，发现特定人群（如男性、同性恋者、离婚者）更易受其影响，并提出了改进监测与预防的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来社会隔离和孤独感加剧，与自杀率上升密切相关。然而，美国国家暴力死亡报告系统（NVDRS）尚未将这些因素纳入结构化变量中，因此需要新的方法来识别和分析这些因素。

Method: 研究采用自然语言处理（NLP）技术，通过主题建模构建词典，并开发监督学习分类器，分析执法部门和法医的叙述文本。

Result: 在2002至2020年的30万例自杀中，识别出1,198例涉及长期社会隔离。男性、同性恋者和离婚者被归类为长期社会隔离的几率更高。此外，研究还发现离婚、失去子女监护权、被驱逐或搬迁以及分手等是重要的社会隔离预测因素。

Conclusion: 该研究方法可有效提升美国社会隔离与孤独感的监测和预防能力，为相关干预措施提供数据支持。

Abstract: Social isolation and loneliness, which have been increasing in recent years
strongly contribute toward suicide rates. Although social isolation and
loneliness are not currently recorded within the US National Violent Death
Reporting System's (NVDRS) structured variables, natural language processing
(NLP) techniques can be used to identify these constructs in law enforcement
and coroner medical examiner narratives. Using topic modeling to generate
lexicon development and supervised learning classifiers, we developed
high-quality classifiers (average F1: .86, accuracy: .82). Evaluating over
300,000 suicides from 2002 to 2020, we identified 1,198 mentioning chronic
social isolation. Decedents had higher odds of chronic social isolation
classification if they were men (OR = 1.44; CI: 1.24, 1.69, p<.0001), gay (OR =
3.68; 1.97, 6.33, p<.0001), or were divorced (OR = 3.34; 2.68, 4.19, p<.0001).
We found significant predictors for other social isolation topics of recent or
impending divorce, child custody loss, eviction or recent move, and break-up.
Our methods can improve surveillance and prevention of social isolation and
loneliness in the United States.

### [8] [Semantically-Aware Rewards for Open-Ended R1 Training in Free-Form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15068)
*Zongxia Li,Yapei Chang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Zichao Liang,Yoo Yeon Sung,Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PrefBERT模型，用于评估开放式生成长文本的质量，并通过GRPO训练提供更好的语义奖励反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在评估开放式生成长文本时，常忽略关键方面如连贯性、风格或相关性，或受预训练数据偏差影响，导致评估不足。

Method: 使用PrefBERT评分模型，基于多样化的长文本风格和质量评分数据集，为GRPO训练提供语义奖励反馈。

Result: PrefBERT在多种评估中表现可靠，优于传统指标ROUGE-L和BERTScore，且能更好地与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: PrefBERT作为奖励信号训练策略模型，能生成更符合人类偏好的响应，优于传统指标训练的结果。

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended long-form generation is challenging because it is hard
to define what clearly separates good from bad outputs. Existing methods often
miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by
pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored
problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for
evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training
with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response
evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality,
PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback
than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive
evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis,
we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length
responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with
the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using
PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better
aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics. Our
code is available at https://github.com/zli12321/long_form_rl.

### [9] [Learning-Time Encoding Shapes Unlearning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15076)
*Ruihan Wu,Konstantin Garov,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了学习阶段知识编码方式对LLMs事后遗忘（unlearning）效果的影响，发现使用转述描述学习可提升遗忘性能，但文本块中遗忘单个知识仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在现实中的广泛应用，出于隐私法规或修正有害内容等需求，事后遗忘特定知识的能力变得至关重要。现有研究通常假设训练过程和模型固定，本文旨在探索学习阶段知识编码对遗忘效果的实际影响。

Method: 通过实验实证分析不同知识编码方式（如使用转述描述）对遗忘性能的影响，并测试从文本块中移除单个知识的可行性。

Result: 关键发现：1）使用转述描述学习能提升遗忘效果；2）从文本块中精准遗忘单个知识仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 学习阶段的知识编码策略可能是实现可靠事后遗忘的核心因素，需进一步优化以应对复杂场景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in the real world,
the ability to ``unlearn'', or remove specific pieces of knowledge post hoc,
has become essential for a variety of reasons ranging from privacy regulations
to correcting outdated or harmful content. Prior work has proposed unlearning
benchmarks and algorithms, and has typically assumed that the training process
and the target model are fixed. In this work, we empirically investigate how
learning-time choices in knowledge encoding impact the effectiveness of
unlearning factual knowledge. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
learning with paraphrased descriptions improves unlearning performance and (2)
unlearning individual piece of knowledge from a chunk of text is challenging.
Our results suggest that learning-time knowledge encoding may play a central
role in enabling reliable post-hoc unlearning.

### [10] [Improving Dialogue Discourse Parsing through Discourse-aware Utterance Clarification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15081)
*Yaxin Fan,Peifeng Li,Qiaoming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对话话语解析方法，通过引入话语感知澄清模块和贡献感知偏好优化，有效解决对话中的歧义问题，显著提升了解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的省略和习语等语言特征常导致话语关系模糊，给解析器带来挑战。为解决这一问题，研究旨在提升对话话语解析的准确性。

Method: 提出话语感知澄清模块（DCM），包含澄清类型推理和话语目标推理；引入贡献感知偏好优化（CPO）以减少错误澄清的连锁影响。

Result: 在STAC和Molweni数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，有效解决了歧义问题。

Conclusion: 通过DCM和CPO的结合，该方法在对话话语解析中表现出色，为复杂语言特征的解析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations
between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in
dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that
obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for
parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification
Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM
employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and
discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the
latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore,
we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the
risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO
enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM
and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and
alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and
Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities
and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

*Junke Wang,Hongshun Ling,Li Zhang,Longqian Zhang,Fang Wang,Yuan Gao,Zhi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出CKD-EHR框架，通过知识蒸馏技术提升EHR疾病预测模型的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在医疗知识表示不足和临床部署效率低下方面存在挑战，需要改进。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-7B作为教师模型生成软标签，通过多粒度注意力蒸馏机制将知识迁移到轻量级BERT学生模型。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上，CKD-EHR显著提升诊断准确率9%，F1分数27%，推理速度加快22.2倍。

Conclusion: CKD-EHR框架提高了资源利用效率，增强了诊断准确性和及时性，为临床资源优化提供了实用技术方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have
demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and
enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two
major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low
efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study
proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which
achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge
distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is
first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher
model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity
attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is
transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that
on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline
model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and
a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only
greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly
enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical
technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings. The code and
data for this research are available athttps://github.com/209506702/CKD_EHR.

### [12] [Modeling the One-to-Many Property in Open-Domain Dialogue with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15131)
*Jing Yang Lee,Kong-Aik Lee,Woon-Seng Gan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过分解开放域对话生成任务为多响应生成和偏好选择，以提升响应多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放域对话具有一对多属性，即单一对话上下文可对应多个合适响应。现有基于大语言模型的对话代理未显式建模该属性，导致响应多样性不足。

Method: 1) 构建o2mDial语料库捕获一对多属性；2) 将对话生成分解为多响应生成(MRG)和基于偏好的选择(PS)两阶段；3) 提出新的上下文学习、指令微调策略及MRG评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，该框架使较小模型在保持上下文连贯性的同时，响应多样性提升高达90%，接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模一对多属性并通过两阶段生成-选择框架，可有效提升开放域对话系统的响应多样性和质量。

Abstract: Open-domain Dialogue (OD) exhibits a one-to-many (o2m) property, whereby
multiple appropriate responses exist for a single dialogue context. Despite
prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity,
most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we
model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key
tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS),
which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse
high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a
single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and
PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the
o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.
Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning
strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a
model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the
proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall
response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response
quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.

### [13] [Thunder-Tok: Minimizing Tokens per Word in Tokenizing Korean Texts for Generative Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15138)
*Gyeongje Cho,Yeonkyoun So,Chanwoo Park,Sangmin Lee,Sungmok Jung,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thunder-Tok是一种新型韩语分词器，通过规则预分词和分支熵算法降低token数量10%，提升推理速度且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对韩语的语言结构，设计高效分词器以减少token数量（降低fertility），同时保持模型性能。

Method: 结合规则预分词、种子词汇表及分支熵选择算法，增加平均token长度以保留语言信息。

Result: 相比BPE，token数量减少10%，推理速度提升10%，下游任务性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 基于语言学的方法能有效设计高效分词器，平衡效率与性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Thunder-Tok, a new Korean tokenizer designed to reduce
token fertility without compromising model performance. Our approach uses a
rule-based pre-tokenization method that aligns with the linguistic structure of
the Korean language. We also create a seed vocabulary containing tokens that
resemble linguistic units and employ a branching entropy-based selection
algorithm. These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering
fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results
indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces
the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to
BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These
findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and

TL;DR: 该研究通过首因效应和近因效应分析状态空间语言模型的记忆机制，揭示了信息保留与遗忘的动态过程，并识别出三种关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解状态空间语言模型如何在序列处理中保留和遗忘信息，特别是通过首因效应和近因效应来揭示记忆的动态特性。

Method: 研究方法包括在Mamba架构上应用结构化召回任务，通过有针对性的消融和输入扰动验证发现，分析了1.4B和7B参数的两个大型基于Mamba的语言模型。

Result: 研究结果发现三种机制：长期记忆由选择性状态空间块中的稀疏通道支持；短期记忆受delta调制递归控制；记忆分配受语义规律性动态调节。

Conclusion: 结论指出，状态空间语言模型的记忆机制复杂且动态，受多种因素影响，这些发现有助于优化模型设计和理解其记忆行为。

Abstract: We study memory in state-space language models using primacy and recency
effects as behavioral tools to uncover how information is retained and
forgotten over time. Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba
architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating
strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify
three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is
supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state
space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally
linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by
delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to
exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items
are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that
memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated
relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the
tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted
ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language
models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于联合国可持续发展目标（SDGs）的数据规模庞大且复杂，追踪进展困难。文本分类模型，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs），因其处理复杂语言模式和语义的能力，成为自动化分析这些数据的关键工具。

Method: 研究分析了专有和开源LLM在单标签多类文本分类任务中的表现，并评估了零样本学习、少样本学习和微调等任务适应技术的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，通过提示工程优化的小型模型可以达到与大型模型（如OpenAI的GPT）相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在SDGs文本分类任务中，优化后的小型LLM可以媲美大型模型，为资源有限的环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In 2012, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) aimed at creating a more sustainable and improved future by 2030.
However, tracking progress toward these goals is difficult because of the
extensive scale and complexity of the data involved. Text classification models
have become vital tools in this area, automating the analysis of vast amounts
of text from a variety of sources. Additionally, large language models (LLMs)
have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks,
including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex
linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and
open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task
focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task
adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot
and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain. The results
reveal that smaller models, when optimized through prompt engineering, can
perform on par with larger models like OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
Transformer).

TL;DR: 论文提出ProtoReasoning框架，通过抽象推理原型提升大模型的跨领域推理能力，实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大模型在长链推理中展现出跨领域泛化能力，但其底层机制尚不明确。作者假设这种能力源于共享的抽象推理原型。

Method: 提出ProtoReasoning框架：1)自动化构建问题对应的原型表示；2)通过Prolog/PDDL解释器验证；3)在原型空间内可扩展合成保证正确的问题。

Result: 实验显示框架在逻辑推理(提升4.7%)、规划任务(6.3%)、通用推理(4.0%)和数学(1.0%)上均优于基线，验证原型空间训练能增强结构相似问题的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 推理原型是大模型可泛化推理的基础，原型空间学习比纯自然语言训练具有更好的结构泛化性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) trained with Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain
generalization capabilities. However, the underlying mechanisms supporting such
transfer remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that cross-domain
generalization arises from shared abstract reasoning prototypes -- fundamental
reasoning patterns that capture the essence of problems across domains. These
prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly
diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this
hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning
ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical
representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for
planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction
pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations;
(2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through
Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems
arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive
experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline
models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning
tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics
(AIME24). Significantly, our ablation studies confirm that learning in
prototype space also demonstrates enhanced generalization to structurally
similar problems compared to training solely on natural language
representations, validating our hypothesis that reasoning prototypes serve as
the foundation for generalizable reasoning in large language models.

*Yongqi Fan,Yating Wang,Guandong Wang,Jie Zhai,Jingping Liu,Qi Ye,Tong Ruan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MinosEval方法，针对开放性问题回答（QA）任务，区分事实性和非事实性问题，采用不同评估策略，提升自动评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放性问题回答（QA）是评估大语言模型（LLM）能力的关键任务，但传统评估指标如ROUGE和BERTScore难以捕捉语义相似性，现有LLM评估方法缺乏直观解释性，且忽视事实性与非事实性问题的区别。

Method: 提出MinosEval方法，首先区分开放性问题类型，对事实性问题采用自适应关键点评分策略，对非事实性问题采用实例感知的列表排序策略。

Result: 在多个开放QA数据集上的实验表明，MinosEval与人工标注更一致，并提供更可解释的结果。

Conclusion: MinosEval通过区分问题类型并采用针对性评估策略，有效提升了开放QA评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Open-ended question answering (QA) is a key task for evaluating the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Compared to closed-ended QA, it
demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse
expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial
and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to
capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses
and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as
pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive
interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some
descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most
notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and
non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes
open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different
evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point
scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware
listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets,
including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community
resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers
more interpretable results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估现有语言技术对不同语言变体的理解能力，特别是巴斯克语和西班牙语的变体，以填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 研究方法包括构建一个手动整理的平行数据集，使用自然语言推理（NLI）作为核心任务，并通过编码器-解码器大语言模型进行跨语言和上下文学习实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，处理语言变体时模型性能下降，尤其是巴斯克语的西方方言，错误分析表明性能下降与语言变体本身而非词汇重叠有关。

Conclusion: 结论指出，语言变体尤其是边缘方言（如巴斯克语的西方方言）对模型性能有显著影响，这与语言学理论一致，所有数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of current language technologies to
understand Basque and Spanish language varieties. We use Natural Language
Inference (NLI) as a pivot task and introduce a novel, manually-curated
parallel dataset in Basque and Spanish, along with their respective variants.
Our empirical analysis of crosslingual and in-context learning experiments
using encoder-only and decoder-based Large Language Models (LLMs) shows a
performance drop when handling linguistic variation, especially in Basque.
Error analysis suggests that this decline is not due to lexical overlap, but
rather to the linguistic variation itself. Further ablation experiments
indicate that encoder-only models particularly struggle with Western Basque,
which aligns with linguistic theory that identifies peripheral dialects (e.g.,
Western) as more distant from the standard. All data and code are publicly
available.

Abstract: This article addresses domain knowledge gaps in general large language models
for historical text analysis in the context of computational humanities and
AIGC technology. We propose the Graph RAG framework, combining chain-of-thought
prompting, self-instruction generation, and process supervision to create a The
First Four Histories character relationship dataset with minimal manual
annotation. This dataset supports automated historical knowledge extraction,
reducing labor costs. In the graph-augmented generation phase, we introduce a
collaborative mechanism between knowledge graphs and retrieval-augmented
generation, improving the alignment of general models with historical
knowledge. Experiments show that the domain-specific model Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B,
with Simplified Chinese input and chain-of-thought prompting, achieves optimal
performance in relation extraction (F1 = 0.68). The DeepSeek model integrated
with GraphRAG improves F1 by 11% (0.08-0.19) on the open-domain C-CLUE relation
extraction dataset, surpassing the F1 value of Xunzi-Qwen1.5-14B (0.12),
effectively alleviating hallucinations phenomenon, and improving
interpretability. This framework offers a low-resource solution for classical
text knowledge extraction, advancing historical knowledge services and
humanities research.

Abstract: We present TopClustRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
developed for the LiveRAG Challenge, which evaluates end-to-end question
answering over large-scale web corpora. Our system employs a hybrid retrieval
strategy combining sparse and dense indices, followed by K-Means clustering to
group semantically similar passages. Representative passages from each cluster
are used to construct cluster-specific prompts for a large language model
(LLM), generating intermediate answers that are filtered, reranked, and finally
synthesized into a single, comprehensive response. This multi-stage pipeline
enhances answer diversity, relevance, and faithfulness to retrieved evidence.
Evaluated on the FineWeb Sample-10BT dataset, TopClustRAG ranked 2nd in
faithfulness and 7th in correctness on the official leaderboard, demonstrating
the effectiveness of clustering-based context filtering and prompt aggregation
in large-scale RAG systems.

TL;DR: 韩国司法系统要求公开法庭判决前需去标识化，但现有方法效率低且法律定义模糊。为此，研究者提出Thunder-DeID框架，包含首个韩语法律数据集、系统化的个人身份信息分类和端到端深度学习去标识化流程，性能达到最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前韩国法庭判决的去标识化过程无法满足大规模处理需求，且法律对个人标识的定义模糊，难以适配技术解决方案。

Method: 构建首个带标注的韩语法律数据集，系统化分类个人身份信息，并开发基于深度神经网络的端到端去标识化流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在法庭判决去标识化任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Thunder-DeID框架有效解决了韩国司法系统中去标识化的效率和法律适配问题，为相关领域提供了技术参考。

Abstract: To ensure a balance between open access to justice and personal data
protection, the South Korean judiciary mandates the de-identification of court
judgments before they can be publicly disclosed. However, the current
de-identification process is inadequate for handling court judgments at scale
while adhering to strict legal requirements. Additionally, the legal
definitions and categorizations of personal identifiers are vague and not
well-suited for technical solutions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
de-identification framework called Thunder-DeID, which aligns with relevant
laws and practices. Specifically, we (i) construct and release the first Korean
legal dataset containing annotated judgments along with corresponding lists of
entity mentions, (ii) introduce a systematic categorization of Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), and (iii) develop an end-to-end deep neural
network (DNN)-based de-identification pipeline. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
de-identification of court judgments.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用NLP任务中表现出色，但在临床试验招募等关键领域的应用仍有限。论文旨在探讨如何利用LLMs的知识聚合和推理能力改进试验与患者的匹配。

Method: 论文首次系统分析了试验-患者匹配任务，并对新兴的基于LLM的方法进行了背景化分析，批判性评估了现有基准、方法和评估框架。

Result: 研究发现当前LLM辅助方法依赖专有模型和弱评估基准，指出了在临床研究中采用LLM技术面临的挑战。

Conclusion: 论文总结了LLMs在临床试验招募中的潜力，并提出了未来发展的方向，强调了构建更通用解决方案的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have greatly improved general-domain NLP tasks. Yet,
their adoption in critical domains, such as clinical trial recruitment, remains
limited. As trials are designed in natural language and patient data is
represented as both structured and unstructured text, the task of matching
trials and patients benefits from knowledge aggregation and reasoning abilities
of LLMs. Classical approaches are trial-specific and LLMs with their ability to
consolidate distributed knowledge hold the potential to build a more general
solution. Yet recent applications of LLM-assisted methods rely on proprietary
models and weak evaluation benchmarks. In this survey, we are the first to
analyze the task of trial-patient matching and contextualize emerging LLM-based
approaches in clinical trial recruitment. We critically examine existing
benchmarks, approaches and evaluation frameworks, the challenges to adopting
LLM technologies in clinical research and exciting future directions.

Result: 该方法将低资源语言在跨领域数据上的识别性能提升了3.2%。

Conclusion: 监督对比学习能有效增强语言识别模型对低资源语言的处理能力。

Abstract: Language identification (LID) is a critical step in curating multilingual LLM
pretraining corpora from web crawls. While many studies on LID model training
focus on collecting diverse training data to improve performance, low-resource
languages -- often limited to single-domain data, such as the Bible -- continue
to perform poorly. To resolve these class imbalance and bias issues, we propose
a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) approach to learn
domain-invariant representations for low-resource languages. Through an
extensive analysis, we show that our approach improves LID performance on
out-of-domain data for low-resource languages by 3.2%, demonstrating its

Conclusion: 行为测试能有效揭示临床LLMs的推理策略，为设计更安全、透明的医疗AI系统提供依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical decision
support, yet current evaluation methods often fail to distinguish genuine
medical reasoning from superficial patterns. We introduce DeVisE (Demographics
and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing
fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge
notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based
(synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting
demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate
five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under
both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1)
input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note;
and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital
length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent
counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more
stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes. Notably,
demographic factors subtly but consistently influence outputs, emphasizing the
importance of fairness-aware evaluation. This work highlights the utility of
behavioral testing in exposing the reasoning strategies of clinical LLMs and
informing the design of safer, more transparent medical AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型在现代工作流程中不可或缺，但其全球有效性依赖于对本地社会文化背景的理解。为此，需要评估和改进模型对印度丰富文化多样性的理解。

Method: 通过构建包含21,853个问题-答案对的SANSKRITI数据集，覆盖印度28个邦和8个联邦属地的16个文化属性，对主流大语言模型、印度语言模型和小型语言模型进行评估。

Result: 评估显示，许多模型在处理文化细微差别的查询时表现不佳，尤其是在地区特定背景下存在显著差异。

Conclusion: SANSKRITI为评估和改进语言模型的文化理解能力设定了新标准，提供了全面、文化丰富且多样化的数据集。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are indispensable tools shaping modern workflows, but
their global effectiveness depends on understanding local socio-cultural
contexts. To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to
evaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.
Comprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states

cultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals
and ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,
art, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and
personalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural
tapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic
Language Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant
disparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many
models struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,
culturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for

Abstract: Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization
for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive
multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC
comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with
ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach
enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore
summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using
article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and
(4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's
effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and
GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component
combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise
using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable
insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps
determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation
(NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack
user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images,
and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language
resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在低资源语言（如斯瓦希里语）中表现不佳，主要由于数据稀缺和预训练中的代表性不足。跨语言词汇对齐是关键挑战。

Method: 采用Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI)方法，结合Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)和对比学习目标，针对早期内部层（如第2层）进行微调。

Result: TLI显著提升了623个斯瓦希里语-英语词对的词汇对齐效果，平均余弦相似度从0.3211提升至0.4113（+28.08%），且对未见的63个词对也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TLI能够有效增强模型在低资源语言中的跨语言词汇对齐能力，提供了一种参数高效且有效的策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their performance in low-resource languages (LRLs), such as Swahili, often lags
due to data scarcity and underrepresentation in pre-training. A key challenge
is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like
translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces
Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.
We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits
strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its
early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine
similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its
final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).
TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a
contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting
embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our
experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical
alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine
similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More
importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control
word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17
x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve
and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a
parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in
LRL-focused LLMs.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Zhicheng Yang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个细粒度评估框架和Peak Sharpness Score (PSS)指标，用于改进多模态大语言模型在GUI代理中的定位准确性，并通过Context-Aware Cropping技术提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在GUI代理中表现出定位错误（幻觉），影响了可靠性。传统准确性指标无法捕捉这些细微错误，因此需要更精细的评估方法和改进技术。

Method: 论文提出了一个细粒度评估框架，将模型预测分为四类，并引入PSS指标量化模型不确定性。此外，还提出了无需训练的Context-Aware Cropping技术，通过自适应优化输入上下文提升模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，该框架和方法能有效揭示模型失败模式，提升GUI代理行为的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进MLLMs在GUI代理中的可靠性提供了实用见解和方法，增强了模型在空间动作任务中的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled GUI agents to interact
with operating systems by grounding language into spatial actions. Despite
their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit
hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We
propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions
into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional
accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak
Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic
continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this
insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique
that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable
insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.

TL;DR: AgentGroupChat-V2是一个新型多智能体框架，通过并行架构、自适应协作引擎和组织优化策略，显著提升复杂任务处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统在架构设计、跨领域通用性和性能保证方面面临挑战，尤其是在任务复杂性和智能体数量增加时。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：1) 分治全并行架构；2) 自适应协作引擎；3) 智能体组织优化策略。

Result: 在多个领域表现优异，GSM8K准确率91.50%，AIME准确率30.4%，HumanEval pass@1达79.20%，任务难度越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: AgentGroupChat-V2为构建高效通用的LLM多智能体系统提供了全面解决方案，在复杂推理场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language model based multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential in social simulation and complex task resolution domains. However,
current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design,
cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task
complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a
novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1)
a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries
into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and
distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that
dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based
on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies
combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition.
Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance
across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best
baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME
(nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance
advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty,
particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage
points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that
AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient,
general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex
reasoning scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出RE-IMAGINE框架，通过生成不同层次的推理问题变体，评估大语言模型的真实推理能力，发现模型依赖统计记忆而非真实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在推理基准测试中表现优异，但尚不清楚这种表现是源于真实推理能力还是对训练数据的统计记忆。受因果阶梯理论启发，研究旨在区分模型的推理层次。

Method: 提出RE-IMAGINE框架，通过中间符号表示生成不可仅靠记忆解决的多样化问题，覆盖数学、代码和逻辑等领域，评估模型在不同推理层次的表现。

Result: 实验表明，当面对问题变体时，多个大语言模型家族性能下降，揭示其过去表现部分依赖统计记忆而非真实推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究证实大语言模型存在对统计记忆的依赖，为针对推理层次能力的进一步研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have reported high accuracy on reasoning
benchmarks. However, it is still unclear whether the observed results arise
from true reasoning or from statistical recall of the training set. Inspired by
the ladder of causation (Pearl, 2009) and its three levels (associations,
interventions and counterfactuals), this paper introduces RE-IMAGINE, a
framework to characterize a hierarchy of reasoning ability in LLMs, alongside
an automated pipeline to generate problem variations at different levels of the
hierarchy. By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation,
RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using
memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across
reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our
framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs,
and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem
variations. These assessments indicate a degree of reliance on statistical
recall for past performance, and open the door to further research targeting
skills across the reasoning hierarchy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CINGS的后训练监督方法，通过将相关上下文前置到响应中并仅计算响应标记的损失，增强了大型语言模型在文本和视觉领域的基于上下文的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）常需补充外部知识以提供未编码的信息或减少幻觉。然而，简单地在推理时附加上下文并不能确保生成的响应基于上下文。

Method: 提出了Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS)，在训练时将相关上下文前置到响应中，仅计算响应标记的损失并屏蔽上下文。

Result: CINGS训练的模型在11个信息寻求数据集上优于其他训练方法，并在视觉语言领域减少了幻觉，同时保持了生成响应的整体下游性能。

Conclusion: CINGS通过改变模型的先验知识和行为，隐式鼓励更多地依赖外部上下文，从而在不影响整体性能的情况下增强了基于上下文的生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often supplemented with external knowledge
to provide information not encoded in their parameters or to reduce
hallucination. In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by
grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work
has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure
grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding
Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained
with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only
over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments
demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both
textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In
the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11
information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding
techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's
LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four
benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.
This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream
performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced
grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior
knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external
context.

TL;DR: SPARE框架通过参考引导的单步标注提升大语言模型多步推理能力，在多个领域数据集上验证了其高效性和性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多步推理任务中，高效且高质量的自动化过程标注仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 提出了SPARE框架，通过将每个解决步骤与参考解决方案中的一个或多个步骤对齐，并伴随明确的评估推理，实现单步标注。

Result: SPARE在数学推理、多跳组合问答和空间推理四个数据集上有效促进了过程监督，推理性能优于基线，效率提升2.6倍。

Conclusion: SPARE框架在多步推理任务中展现出高效和性能优势，公开的代码库和模型有助于进一步研究和复现。

Abstract: Process or step-wise supervision has played a crucial role in advancing
complex multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation
with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that
enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one
or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning
for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively
facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains:
mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial
reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves
reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL
setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for
ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE
achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while
offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,
compared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a
trained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research
and reproducibility.

### [33] [Enhancing Hyperbole and Metaphor Detection with Their Bidirectional Dynamic Interaction and Emotion Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15504)
*Li Zheng,Sihang Wang,Hao Fei,Zuquan Peng,Fei Li,Jianming Fu,Chong Teng,Donghong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于情感引导的双向动态交互框架EmoBi，用于检测文本中的夸张和隐喻，显著提升了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于夸张和隐喻的语义隐晦和表达多样性，现有方法大多仅关注表层文本特征，忽略了它们之间的关联及隐含情感的影响。

Method: EmoBi框架包含情感分析模块、基于情感的领域映射模块和双向动态交互模块，通过挖掘情感内涵和双向交互提升检测效果。

Result: 实验表明，EmoBi在四个数据集上均优于基线方法，在TroFi和HYPO-L数据集上的F1分数分别提升了28.1%和23.1%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过情感引导和双向交互机制，有效推进了夸张和隐喻检测的技术发展，展现了其潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic
obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.
Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the
associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit
emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,
we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based
on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis
module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.
Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source
domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole
and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the
mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification
mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments
show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.
Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for
hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on
the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore
the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and
metaphor detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索了如何通过强化学习和内部推理提升大语言模型的回答可信度，采用GRPO方法优化答案正确性、引用充分性和拒绝质量，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成可信且基于证据的回答方面仍面临挑战，尤其是在检索增强生成（RAG）场景中，模型常出现遗漏答案、错误引用或不当拒绝等问题。

Method: 使用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）方法，通过可验证的结果奖励（答案正确性、引用充分性、拒绝质量）训练模型，无需黄金推理轨迹或昂贵标注。采用两阶段训练策略，先优化答案和引用行为，再优化拒绝行为。

Result: 实验表明，结合推理的模型在ASQA、QAMPARI等数据集上显著优于仅指令调优的模型，尤其在处理无法回答的查询和生成充分引用的回答方面表现突出。结合GPT-4蒸馏的指令调优进一步提升了长生成式QA任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，推理增强、分阶段优化和基于结果的强化学习对构建更可验证、可靠的大语言模型具有重要价值。

Abstract: Generating grounded and trustworthy responses remains a key challenge for
large language models (LLMs). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with
citation-based grounding holds promise, instruction-tuned models frequently
fail even in straightforward scenarios: missing explicitly stated answers,
citing incorrectly, or refusing when evidence is available. In this work, we
explore how reinforcement learning (RL) and internal reasoning can enhance
grounding in LLMs. We use the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) method
to train models using verifiable outcome-based rewards targeting answer
correctness, citation sufficiency, and refusal quality, without requiring gold
reasoning traces or expensive annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented
models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in
handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage
training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal,
further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal. Additionally, we
revisit instruction tuning via GPT-4 distillation and find that combining it
with GRPO enhances performance on long-form, generative QA tasks. Overall, our
findings highlight the value of reasoning, stage-wise optimization, and
outcome-driven RL for building more verifiable and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出RATTENTION方法，通过结合局部注意力和线性注意力机制，在保持训练效率的同时，提升了短上下文和长上下文场景下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前局部-全局注意力模型在窗口大小的选择上面临帕累托权衡：大窗口保持性能但效率提升有限，小窗口则可能导致性能下降。论文旨在解决局部注意力完全忽略窗口外标记的固有局限性。

Method: 提出RATTENTION方法，将局部注意力与专门设计的线性注意力机制结合，以捕捉窗口外标记的信息。

Result: 在3B和12B规模的预训练实验中，RATTENTION实现了性能与效率的优越帕累托权衡，窗口大小仅为512时仍能匹配全注意力模型的性能，并在长上下文任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RATTENTION通过创新的注意力机制设计，显著提升了局部-全局注意力模型的效率与性能平衡，且不影响训练速度。

Abstract: Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling
alternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training
and inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a
Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but
offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller
windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and
Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining
length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift
this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains
even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic
limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the
defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated
with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information
from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B
scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between
performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of
just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across
diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear
attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context
performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements
do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel
implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training
speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于梯度的数据近似方法，从公开文本语料库中筛选匹配度最高的数据，以恢复原始模型的训练数据，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型通常公开权重但封闭训练数据，这导致难以理解和复现模型行为。论文旨在解决如何从模型权重中近似推断出原始训练数据的问题。

Method: 提出了一种梯度驱动的方法，从大规模公开文本语料库中选择与原始模型权重最匹配的数据子集，用于训练新模型。

Result: 在AG News分类任务中，性能从65%提升至80%（专家基准为88%）；在MSMARCO微调任务中，困惑度从3.3降至2.3（专家模型为2.0）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效从公开数据中恢复近似训练集，显著提升模型性能，为数据封闭场景下的模型复现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern language models often have open weights but closed training data. We
formalize the problem of data approximation from model weights and propose
several baselines and metrics. We develop a gradient-based approach that
selects the highest-matching data from a large public text corpus and show its
effectiveness at recovering useful data given only weights of the original and
finetuned models. Even when none of the true training data is known, our method
is able to locate a small subset of public Web documents can be used to train a
model to close to the original model performance given models trained for both
classification and supervised-finetuning. On the AG News classification task,
our method improves performance from 65% (using randomly selected data) to 80%,
approaching the expert benchmark of 88%. When applied to a model trained with
SFT on MSMARCO web documents, our method reduces perplexity from 3.3 to 2.3,
compared to an expert LLAMA model's perplexity of 2.0.

TL;DR: 提出Predictive Generation框架，通过预测性解码减少LLMs在实时语音聊天中的响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在实时语音聊天应用中常因生成首句耗时导致音频输出延迟，影响用户体验。

Method: 采用Predictive Generation (PredGen)框架，在用户输入时通过推测性解码生成候选响应，提前启动TTS处理。

Result: 在Lmsys和MT-Bench数据集上的模拟实验显示，该方法能有效降低约2倍延迟，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: PredGen显著减少了LLMs在语音交互中的响应延迟，提升了用户体验，同时计算开销可控。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in real-time voice chat
applications, typically in combination with text-to-speech (TTS) systems to
generate audio responses. However, their large size often leads to noticeable
latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting
in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs
are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with
limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily
dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,
which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses
on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose
Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even
eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen
generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the
system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the
Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively
reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while
incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation
that would otherwise go unused.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注二元性别区分，缺乏对非二元性别包容性的全面评估指标。

Method: 开发了多层次的GIFI评估指标，从代词测试到不同性别假设下的生成行为和认知表现进行全面测评。

Result: 发现不同LLM在性别包容性方面存在显著差异，揭示了与各类性别标识相关的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升LLM包容性的重要性，为未来生成模型的性别公平性发展提供了关键基准。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of gender fairness in large language
models (LLMs), focusing on their ability to handle both binary and non-binary
genders. While previous studies primarily focus on binary gender distinctions,
we introduce the Gender Inclusivity Fairness Index (GIFI), a novel and
comprehensive metric that quantifies the diverse gender inclusivity of LLMs.
GIFI consists of a wide range of evaluations at different levels, from simply
probing the model with respect to provided gender pronouns to testing various
aspects of model generation and cognitive behaviors under different gender
assumptions, revealing biases associated with varying gender identifiers. We
conduct extensive evaluations with GIFI on 22 prominent open-source and
proprietary LLMs of varying sizes and capabilities, discovering significant
variations in LLMs' gender inclusivity. Our study highlights the importance of
improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future
advancements in gender fairness in generative models.

Abstract: We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal
scientific context. SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over
1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common

fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting
evidence. We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal
foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and
Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these
models and human experts on SciVer. Through an in-depth analysis of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Discourse-level文本场景图解析任务（DiscoSG），并发布了数据集DiscoSG-DS，同时开发了DiscoSG-Refiner方法，显著提升了多句子描述的场景图解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本场景图解析器主要针对单句描述设计，无法有效处理多句子描述中的跨句共指等现象，导致解析结果碎片化，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 论文提出DiscoSG-Refiner方法，使用一个小型预训练语言模型生成基础图，再通过另一个模型迭代提出图编辑建议，减少全图生成的开销。

Result: DiscoSG-Refiner在SPICE指标上比最佳基线提升约30%，推理速度比GPT-4快86倍，同时显著提升下游任务如多句子描述评估和幻觉检测的性能。

Conclusion: DiscoSG-Refiner为多句子描述的场景图解析提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) now generate discourse-level, multi-sentence
visual descriptions, challenging text scene graph parsers originally designed
for single-sentence caption-to-graph mapping. Current approaches typically
merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing
phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and
degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new
task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our
dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised
multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9
sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in
existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS
improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline,
high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and
smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose
DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a
second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation
overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE
by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster
inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like
discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection. Code and data

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了WikiMixQA基准，用于评估跨模态推理能力，测试了12种先进视觉语言模型在长文档多模态理解上的表现，发现现有模型在复杂推理任务上仍有显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档通常包含复杂的布局、表格和图表，这对自动文档理解（DU）提出了挑战。现有的视觉语言大模型（VLLMs）在处理长上下文视觉输入时的有效性尚不明确，因此需要一个新的基准来评估跨模态推理能力。

Method: 论文引入了WikiMixQA基准，包含1000个多选题（MCQs），这些问题基于从4000个维基百科页面中提取的表格和图表，涵盖七个不同主题。该基准强调复杂推理，要求模型综合多模态信息。

Result: 评估了12种先进视觉语言模型，发现专有模型在直接提供上下文时准确率约为70%，但在需要从长文档中检索信息时性能显著下降。GPT-4-o是唯一在此设置下准确率超过50%的模型，而开源模型表现更差，最高准确率仅为27%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了长上下文多模态推理的挑战，并确立了WikiMixQA作为推动文档理解研究的重要基准。现有模型在复杂推理任务上仍有显著不足，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Documents are fundamental to preserving and disseminating information, often
incorporating complex layouts, tables, and charts that pose significant
challenges for automatic document understanding (DU). While vision-language
large models (VLLMs) have demonstrated improvements across various tasks, their
effectiveness in processing long-context vision inputs remains unclear. This
paper introduces WikiMixQA, a benchmark comprising 1,000 multiple-choice
questions (MCQs) designed to evaluate cross-modal reasoning over tables and
charts extracted from 4,000 Wikipedia pages spanning seven distinct topics.
Unlike existing benchmarks, WikiMixQA emphasizes complex reasoning by requiring
models to synthesize information from multiple modalities. We evaluate 12
state-of-the-art vision-language models, revealing that while proprietary
models achieve ~70% accuracy when provided with direct context, their
performance deteriorates significantly when retrieval from long documents is
required. Among these, GPT-4-o is the only model exceeding 50% accuracy in this
setting, whereas open-source models perform considerably worse, with a maximum
accuracy of 27%. These findings underscore the challenges of long-context,
multi-modal reasoning and establish WikiMixQA as a crucial benchmark for
advancing document understanding research.

Abstract: While MCQs are valuable for learning and evaluation, manually creating them
with varying difficulty levels and targeted reading skills remains a
time-consuming and costly task. Recent advances in generative AI provide an
opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently. However, assessing the
actual quality and reliability of generated MCQs has received limited attention
-- particularly regarding cases where generation fails. This aspect becomes
particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in
real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on
English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the
capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading
comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses
on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and
span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review
and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses
to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show
that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored
ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and
answerability. Also, challenges remain in generating distractors that engage
students and meet established criteria for high-quality MCQ option design.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生成错误信息后面对矛盾证据时表现出的显性后悔机制，旨在提升模型可靠性并探索神经网络中的认知编码方式。

Method: 1) 通过策略性提示构建后悔数据集 2) 提出S-CDI指标定位最优后悔表示层 3) 设计RDS和GIC指标分析神经元功能分组及激活模式。

Result: 成功识别出最优后悔表示层（S-CDI验证），发现跨层M型解耦模式，并将神经元分为后悔神经元、非后悔神经元和双功能神经元三类。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解语言模型的认知机制提供了新工具，揭示了信息处理的动态分层特性，对提高模型可解释性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Regret in Large Language Models refers to their explicit regret expression
when presented with evidence contradicting their previously generated
misinformation. Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model
reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.
To understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in
model outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis
requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing
occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the
absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of
metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of
metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these
limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret
dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised
Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret
representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to
identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze
activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the
optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly
enhanced performance in probe classification experiments. Additionally, we
discovered an M-shaped decoupling pattern across model layers, revealing how
information processing alternates between coupling and decoupling phases.
Through the RDS metric, we categorized neurons into three distinct functional
groups: regret neurons, non-regret neurons, and dual neurons.

<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是探究跨文化交际中的误解是否源于词语的字面意义差异，还是更普遍的语用因素如礼貌和简洁规范。

Method: 方法包括三个实验，分析英美英语使用者对“quite”和“very”等程度副词的理解，并开发计算认知模型模拟听者推理过程。

Result: 结果显示，程度副词理解的跨文化差异是字面意义不同和对话语成本重视程度不同的共同结果。

Conclusion: 结论指出，跨文化理解差异是语义变异和语用规范复杂交互的产物，挑战了单一因素的解释。

Abstract: Misunderstandings in cross-cultural communication often arise from subtle
differences in interpretation, but it is unclear whether these differences
arise from the literal meanings assigned to words or from more general
pragmatic factors such as norms around politeness and brevity. In this paper,
we report three experiments examining how speakers of British and American
English interpret intensifiers like "quite" and "very." To better understand
these cross-cultural differences, we developed a computational cognitive model
where listeners recursively reason about speakers who balance informativity,
politeness, and utterance cost. Our model comparisons suggested that
cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a
combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on
utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic
variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in
interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Ordered CommonGen基准，用于评估大语言模型在遵循指令和组合泛化方面的能力，发现现有模型在这些方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式大语言模型在生成包含指定概念的句子时，难以遵循特定的概念顺序，这限制了其在指令遵循和组合泛化方面的应用。

Method: 作者提出了Ordered CommonGen基准，通过测量有序覆盖率来评估模型是否按照指定顺序生成概念，从而同时评估指令遵循和组合泛化能力。

Result: 对36个大语言模型的分析显示，尽管模型能理解指令意图，但对特定概念顺序的偏好导致输出多样性低。表现最佳的模型有序覆盖率仅约75%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，现有大语言模型在指令遵循和组合泛化方面仍需改进，特别是在处理概念顺序时。

Abstract: In generative commonsense reasoning tasks such as CommonGen, generative large
language models (LLMs) compose sentences that include all given concepts.
However, when focusing on instruction-following capabilities, if a prompt
specifies a concept order, LLMs must generate sentences that adhere to the
specified order. To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following
abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether
concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous
evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36
LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of
instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to
low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is
altered. Moreover, even the most instruction-compliant LLM achieved only about
75% ordered coverage, highlighting the need for improvements in both
instruction-following and compositional generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在许多任务上表现出色，但在一致性和鲁棒性推理方面仍有不足。

Method: 采用基于队列的一致性学习（CC-Learn），通过强化学习优化队列准确性、检索奖励和拒绝惩罚的组合目标。

Result: 在ARC-Challenge和StrategyQA等基准测试中，CC-Learn显著提高了模型的准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 队列级强化学习能有效提升大语言模型的推理一致性。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but still struggle with consistent,
robust reasoning. We introduce Cohort-based Consistency Learning (CC-Learn), a
reinforcement learning framework that improves the reliability of LLM reasoning
by training on cohorts of similar questions derived from shared programmatic
abstractions. To enforce cohort-level consistency, we define a composite
objective combining cohort accuracy, a retrieval bonus for effective problem
decomposition, and a rejection penalty for trivial or invalid lookups that
reinforcement learning can directly optimize, unlike supervised fine-tuning.
Optimizing this reward guides the model to adopt uniform reasoning patterns
across all cohort members. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks
(including ARC-Challenge and StrategyQA) show that CC-Learn boosts both
accuracy and reasoning stability over pretrained and SFT baselines. These
results demonstrate that cohort-level RL effectively enhances reasoning
consistency in LLMs.

Motivation: 研究大型推理模型作为个人代理时，其推理过程中可能泄露用户敏感数据的问题，挑战了推理过程内部安全的假设。

Method: 通过探测和代理评估，分析测试时计算方式（尤其是增加推理步骤）对隐私泄露的影响。

Result: 增加推理步骤虽然使模型在最终答案上更谨慎，但也导致推理过程更冗长，泄露更多敏感信息。

Conclusion: 推理提升效用但扩大隐私攻击面，安全措施需覆盖模型内部推理过程，而不仅是输出。

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models
used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often
assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that
reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted
via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and
agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches,
particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing
the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in
their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more
in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility
but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must
extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Method: 论文通过分析21种机器翻译系统在三种不同难度翻译方向上的表现，分类并讨论了实际观察到的性别中立翻译策略。

Result: 结果显示，大多数机器翻译系统在性别模糊情况下未能提供性别中立翻译，但少数系统能够根据目标语言采用特定策略实现中立翻译。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前机器翻译系统在性别中立翻译方面整体表现不足，但部分系统展示了可行的策略，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Gender-inclusive machine translation (MT) should preserve gender ambiguity in
the source to avoid misgendering and representational harms. While gender
ambiguity often occurs naturally in notional gender languages such as English,
maintaining that gender neutrality in grammatical gender languages is a
challenge. Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for
gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation
directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that
are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we
examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral
translation. In general, we report a disappointing absence of gender-neutral
translations in response to gender ambiguity. However, we observe a small
handful of MT systems that switch to gender neutral translation using specific
strategies, depending on the target language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GenRecal的新型通用蒸馏框架，用于解决异构视觉语言模型（VLMs）间的知识迁移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在性能上已接近闭源系统如GPT-4V，但其在资源受限设备上的部署仍面临计算需求高的挑战。此外，不同VLM架构的多样性（如词汇量、分词方式和索引顺序的差异）限制了知识蒸馏的通用性。

Method: GenRecal框架通过引入一个重新校准器（Recalibrator），对齐和适配异构VLM间的特征表示，从而实现在不同类型VLM间的有效知识迁移。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，GenRecal显著提升了基线性能，最终超越了大规模开源和闭源VLMs的表现。

Conclusion: GenRecal为异构VLM间的知识蒸馏提供了一种通用解决方案，有效解决了部署资源受限设备时的计算需求问题，并在性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to achieve performance on par with closed-source systems
like GPT-4V. However, deploying these models in real-world scenarios,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains challenging due to their
substantial computational demands. This has spurred interest in distilling
knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key
challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built
on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size,
token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation
to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a
novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a
Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between
heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different
types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging
benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline
performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source
VLMs.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，错误信息生产和学术不端等社会问题日益严重，现有检测器对私有调优LLM生成的文本检测效果不佳，亟需新的解决方案。

Method: 提出PhantomHunter检测器，采用家族感知学习框架，捕捉基础模型及其衍生模型的家族级共享特征，而非记忆个体特征。

Result: 在LLaMA、Gemma和Mistral家族数据上的实验显示，PhantomHunter在7个基线方法和3个工业服务中表现最优，F1分数超过96%。

Conclusion: PhantomHunter通过家族级特征学习，有效解决了私有调优LLM生成文本的检测难题，为LLM生成文本检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the popularity of large language models (LLMs), undesirable societal
problems like misinformation production and academic misconduct have been more
severe, making LLM-generated text detection now of unprecedented importance.
Although existing methods have made remarkable progress, a new challenge posed
by text from privately tuned LLMs remains underexplored. Users could easily
possess private LLMs by fine-tuning an open-source one with private corpora,
resulting in a significant performance drop of existing detectors in practice.
To address this issue, we propose PhantomHunter, an LLM-generated text detector
specialized for detecting text from unseen, privately-tuned LLMs. Its
family-aware learning framework captures family-level traits shared across the
base models and their derivatives, instead of memorizing individual
characteristics. Experiments on data from LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral families
show its superiority over 7 baselines and 3 industrial services, with F1 scores
of over 96%.

TL;DR: CALM结合符号推理与神经生成，通过多模态数据实现上下文敏感决策，填补逻辑与神经感知之间的鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二值逻辑系统无法捕捉人类决策的细微差别，且在多模态环境中需要人工标注，显得僵化脆弱。神经网络虽能从多模态数据中提取丰富信息，但缺乏可解释的推理结构。CALM旨在整合两者优势，构建能处理多模态输入的类比逻辑系统。

Method: CALM使用领域树表示谓词，通过神经网络迭代优化类比真值，并经过符号推理模块过滤以确保约束满足。神经网络负责捕捉多模态信息，符号模块保障逻辑一致性。

Result: 在填空式物体摆放任务中，CALM以92.2%准确率超越经典逻辑(86.3%)和LLM(59.4%)基线，生成的空间热图既符合逻辑约束又与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: CALM展示了在多模态环境中结合逻辑结构与神经处理的潜力，为需要逻辑精确性和神经信息处理能力的下一代AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Contextual Analog Logic with Multimodality (CALM).
CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make
context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.
  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human
decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,
which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting
rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable
structures for reasoning.
  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,
creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this
integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to
generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate
to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.
  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which
iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of
its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural
networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a
symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.
  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%
accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It
also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints
and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.
  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure
while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments. It lays the
foundation for next-gen AI systems that require the precision and
interpretation of logic and the multimodal information processing of neural
networks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, with environment availability strongly
impacting research. One particularly underexplored intersection is continual
learning (CL) in cooperative multi-agent settings. To remedy this, we introduce
MEAL (Multi-agent Environments for Adaptive Learning), the first benchmark
tailored for continual multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL). Existing CL
benchmarks run environments on the CPU, leading to computational bottlenecks
and limiting the length of task sequences. MEAL leverages JAX for GPU
acceleration, enabling continual learning across sequences of 100 tasks on a
standard desktop PC in a few hours. We show that naively combining popular CL
and MARL methods yields strong performance on simple environments, but fails to
scale to more complex settings requiring sustained coordination and adaptation.
Our ablation study identifies architectural and algorithmic features critical

Motivation: 现有的PPO方法在训练大型语言模型时，由于需要完整的响应生成过程，导致硬件利用率低且训练时间长，尤其是在生成长文本时效率更低。

Conclusion: T-PPO通过优化训练流程和减少冗余计算，显著提升了大型语言模型的训练效率，同时保持了模型的收敛性能。

Abstract: Recently, test-time scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
exceptional reasoning capabilities across scientific and professional tasks by
generating long chains-of-thought (CoT). As a crucial component for developing
these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through
trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent
on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.
In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a
novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy
update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of
low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized
long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting
periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we
propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage
estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of
policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that
allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By
selectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces
redundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing
convergence performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of T-PPO
on AIME 2024 with a 32B base model. The experimental results show that T-PPO
improves the training efficiency of reasoning LLMs by up to 2.5x and
outperforms its existing competitors.

Conclusion: HeurAgenix证明了LLM在自动化设计高效启发式算法方面的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Heuristic algorithms play a vital role in solving combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, yet traditional designs depend heavily on manual expertise and
struggle to generalize across diverse instances. We introduce
\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among
them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an
LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and
extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically
picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's
perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a
state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference
cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity,
we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism
that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception,
enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on
canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing
LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Conclusion: MARL在多卫星地球观测任务中展现出强大的潜力，为分散式任务中的策略学习改进奠定了基础，推动了自主卫星操作的发展。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised
Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring,
disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in
multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional
optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making
demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we
investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling
single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations
using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data
storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the
complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By
leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the
training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms,
including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can
effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing
non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.
The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous
satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy
learning in decentralised EO missions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于无人机和船舶协作的海事边缘计算框架，用于解决海事物联网中的计算卸载和资源分配问题，通过优化算法和异构智能体强化学习方法有效降低了任务执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海事物联网（MIoT）的计算需求快速增长，但不确定的海事任务给计算卸载和资源分配带来了挑战。无人机（UAVs）和船舶的多接入边缘计算（MEC）可以满足这些需求，但需要解决任务不确定性和资源异构性问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种协作MEC框架，利用Lyapunov优化处理任务不确定性，将长期约束转化为短期约束，并通过马尔可夫博弈（MG）建模异构资源问题。采用异构智能体软演员-评论家（HASAC）方法求解优化问题。

Result: 仿真实验验证了所提框架在计算卸载和资源分配方面的有效性，显著降低了任务执行时间。

Conclusion: 通过无人机和船舶的协作，结合优化算法和强化学习，论文提出的框架能够高效处理海事物联网中的不确定任务，为MIoT的计算需求提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase
rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels
based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements.
However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of
inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we
focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through
the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks.
Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading
and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we
formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for
the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the
unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. By
converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a
set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the
heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the
small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a
heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update
various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. Finally,
simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing
computational offloading and resource allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航方法在处理历史观测数据时忽略了数据内部的关联结构，限制了任务性能的进一步提升。论文从因果关系的角度分析了导航任务的特性，旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN)方法，包含一个因果理解模块，用于增强智能体对环境的理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，CAN方法在多种任务和仿真环境中均优于基线方法，且因果理解模块在强化学习和监督学习设置中均能有效泛化。

Conclusion: 通过引入因果框架，CAN方法显著提升了导航任务的性能，且无需额外计算开销。

Abstract: Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate
complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within
Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated
from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically
process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal
association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for
further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the
unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality,
introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional
sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware
Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance
the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and
simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to
the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both
Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process.
The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA
labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection
of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse
data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as
the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating
these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly
integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of a Large Language
Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA) to assist FA engineers in solving their
analysis cases. The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and
external tool utilization, enabling autonomous processing of complex queries,
retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of
human-readable responses. Evaluation results demonstrate the agent's
operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，用于系统构建自然语言状态表示，以指导LLM智能体在重复多智能体游戏中的决策，并发现特定状态表示能更接近博弈论均衡预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在LLM智能体游戏中对历史信息的编码方法缺乏系统性，导致难以比较不同研究间的结果，且无法清晰评估状态表示对智能体行为的影响。

Method: 通过三个维度（动作信息量、奖励信息量、提示风格）系统化自然语言状态表示方法，并应用于动态自私路由游戏进行验证。

Result: 研究发现：1）总结性历史表示；2）遗憾值而非原始收益信息；3）有限他人动作信息，能使LLM智能体行为更接近博弈论均衡且更稳定。

Conclusion: 自然语言状态表示的形式显著影响LLM智能体的决策行为，特定设计可有效提升其与理论预测的一致性及游戏稳定性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as decision-makers in dynamic
settings, but their stateless nature necessitates creating a natural language
representation of history. We present a unifying framework for systematically
constructing natural language "state" representations for prompting LLM agents
in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken
an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact
of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability
between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods
of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the
extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward
informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes
rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e.,
the extent to which the full text history is summarized).
  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it
admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments
\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find
that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language
state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which
provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language
representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw
payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior
that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more
stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit
either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play
over time, or both.

Motivation: 随着AI技术深入个人与职业场景，现有计算机课程难以培养学生将伦理原则转化为实践的能力，亟需引入AI政策教育。

Method: 开发AI政策模块2.0（含AI监管技术作业），通过前后测问卷评估学生态度变化。

Result: 学生伦理意识显著提升，对参与AI监管讨论的信心增强，技术作业被证明是有效的教学工具。

Conclusion: AI政策模块成功填补计算机课程空白，证明政策教育能有效衔接伦理原则与技术实践。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings
across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid
not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI
technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary
computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI
practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical
principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of
AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the
ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future
constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI
engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new
expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI
policy into the CS curriculum. Building on a successful pilot in fall 2024, in
this innovative practice full paper we present an updated and expanded version
of the module, including a technical assignment on "AI regulation". We present
the findings from our pilot of the AI Policy Module 2.0, evaluating student
attitudes towards AI ethics and policy through pre- and post-module surveys.
Following the module, students reported increased concern about the ethical
impacts of AI technologies while also expressing greater confidence in their
abilities to engage in discussions about AI regulation. Finally, we highlight
the AI Regulation Assignment as an effective and engaging tool for exploring
the limits of AI alignment and emphasizing the role of 'policy' in addressing
ethical challenges.

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在复杂问题解决上表现出色，但其常因生成冗余内容导致效率低下和推理成本增加。本文旨在探索并解决这一效率瓶颈。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 效率导向激活技术（无需训练，通过表示空间单一方向调控推理行为）；2) 自奖励效率强化学习框架（动态平衡准确性与简洁性）。

Result: 在7个大型模型和多个数学推理基准测试中，方法显著缩短推理长度（平均减少20%-40%），同时任务准确率保持或提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过引导模型固有能力可有效提升推理效率，为优化大型语言模型的实际部署提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly
enhanced language models' capabilities in complex problem-solving by emulating
human-like deliberative thinking. However, these models often exhibit
overthinking (i.e., the generation of unnecessarily verbose and redundant
content), which hinders efficiency and inflates inference cost. In this work,
we explore the representational and behavioral origins of this inefficiency,
revealing that LRMs inherently possess the capacity for more concise reasoning.
Empirical analyses show that correct reasoning paths vary significantly in
length, and the shortest correct responses often suffice, indicating untapped
efficiency potential. Exploiting these findings, we propose two lightweight
methods to enhance LRM efficiency. First, we introduce Efficiency Steering, a
training-free activation steering technique that modulates reasoning behavior
via a single direction in the model's representation space. Second, we develop
Self-Rewarded Efficiency RL, a reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically balances task accuracy and brevity by rewarding concise correct
solutions. Extensive experiments on seven LRM backbones across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly
reduce reasoning length while preserving or improving task performance. Our
results highlight that reasoning efficiency can be improved by leveraging and
guiding the intrinsic capabilities of existing models in a self-guided manner.

Method: SwarmAgentic框架通过语言驱动探索，联合优化代理功能和协作，并采用类似粒子群优化的反馈引导更新机制，从候选系统中进化出最优解。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models has advanced agentic systems in
decision-making, coordination, and task execution. Yet, existing agentic system
generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent
generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting
adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully
automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from
scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as
interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable
efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a
population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates,
drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our
method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving
high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given
only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all
baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the
TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in
structurally unconstrained tasks. This framework marks a significant step
toward scalable and autonomous agentic system design, bridging swarm
intelligence with fully automated system multi-agent generation. Our code is
publicly released at https://yaoz720.github.io/SwarmAgentic/.

Conclusion: 该研究为具身认知与网络知识访问的交叉领域提出了挑战与机遇，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly

Result: 实验表明开源LLMs具备成为临床助手的潜力，能通过互动提供多视角建议。

Conclusion: 需通过真实医患场景进一步验证MedSyn对诊断准确率和治疗效果的影响。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex, often influenced by cognitive
biases, incomplete information, and case ambiguity. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet
their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the
complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid
human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step,
interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike
static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing
physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative
perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the
potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants. Results show open-source
LLMs are promising as physician assistants in the real world. Future work will
involve real physician interactions to further validate MedSyn's usefulness in
diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习和优化中，采样玻尔兹曼概率分布是关键步骤，但现有方法在处理软约束时效率低下，要么混合速度慢，要么无法保证可行性。

Method: 通过引入二维并行回火算法（2D-PT），在副本中添加第二个维度以插值惩罚强度，从而确保约束满足并提升混合效率。

Result: 在图形稀疏化和Wishart实例中，2D-PT表现出近乎理想的混合效率，KL散度以O(1/t)衰减，速度比传统PT快数个数量级。

Conclusion: 2D-PT广泛适用于约束伊辛问题，可在现有伊辛机器上部署，显著提升采样效率和性能。

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine
learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such
as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary
optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft
constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce
feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the
powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by
adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This
scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to
low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel
tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and
eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a
representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT
achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as
O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of
magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The
method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on
existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into an ecosystem of specialized
"species," each with unique strengths. We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a
671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM)
exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based
framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial
datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings,
information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive
patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively
contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A
pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of
higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects
compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles ("Personas").
  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary
layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects
domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors
the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist,
forming a self-improving loop.
  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI
uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline
models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few
features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems,
information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging
concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (JEPA). By prioritizing reliable, explainable knowledge, NetraAI
offers a new generation of adaptive, self-reflective AI to accelerate clinical
discovery.

Abstract: Decoding natural language from brain activity using non-invasive
electroencephalography (EEG) remains a significant challenge in neuroscience
and machine learning, particularly for open-vocabulary scenarios where
traditional methods struggle with noise and variability. Previous studies have
achieved high accuracy on small-closed vocabularies, but it still struggles on
open vocabularies. In this study, we propose ETS, a framework that integrates
EEG with synchronized eye-tracking data to address two critical tasks: (1)
open-vocabulary text generation and (2) sentiment classification of perceived
language. Our model achieves a superior performance on BLEU and Rouge score for
EEG-To-Text decoding and up to 10% F1 score on EEG-based ternary sentiment
classification, which significantly outperforms supervised baselines.
Furthermore, we show that our proposed model can handle data from various
subjects and sources, showing great potential for high performance open
vocabulary eeg-to-text system.

Abstract: Determining onflow parameters is crucial from the perspectives of wind tunnel
testing and regular flight and wind turbine operations. These parameters have
traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to
challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction
model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters.
It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as
dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or
learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy
systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution
as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning
methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and
onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network
(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights
of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally
executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this
approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)
domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target
domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task
adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the
influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies
varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided. Results successfully
demonstrate the potential of the approach for adaptation to changing data
distribution, domain extension, and task update while the application for noisy

### [70] [PIPE: Physics-Informed Position Encoding for Alignment of Satellite Images and Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14786)
*Haobo Li,Eunseo Jung,Zixin Chen,Zhaowei Wang,Yueya Wang,Huamin Qu,Alexis Kai Hon Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PIPE的轻量级方法，通过将物理信息嵌入视觉语言模型，显著提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性，特别是在台风强度预测上比先前工作提高了12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态时间序列预测方法主要利用文本数据，而忽略了视觉数据（如卫星图像）中的物理信息。这些信息（如时间和地理空间上下文）对预测至关重要，但现有模型难以有效捕捉。

Method: PIPE方法包含两个关键创新：1) 一种物理信息位置索引方案，将物理信息映射到位置ID；2) 一种变频率位置编码机制，用于在嵌入空间中编码物理变量的频率信息和标记的顺序信息。

Result: 在最具代表性且最大的开源卫星图像数据集上的实验表明，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到了最先进的性能，特别是在台风强度预测上比先前工作提高了12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过保留物理信息和顺序信息，显著提升了多模态对齐和预测准确性，为多模态时间序列预测提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

*Funing Li,Yuan Tian,Ruben Noortwyck,Jifeng Zhou,Liming Kuang,Robert Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，用于解决多深度存储系统中异构物品配置的检索问题，通过结合图神经网络和Transformer模型优化检索延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业和物流环境中，快速配送服务的迅速扩展对高效率和更高密度的存储系统提出了更高需求。多深度自主车辆存储和检索系统（AVS/RS）虽然能提高存储密度，但在检索操作中因车道堵塞面临挑战。传统方法将同质物品存储在同一车道，限制了系统的灵活性和适应性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于深度强化学习的框架，结合图神经网络（GNN）和Transformer模型。GNN将拓扑和物品特定信息编码为嵌入，Transformer将这些嵌入映射为全局优先级分配，以优化检索延迟。

Result: 大量数值实验表明，所提出的神经网络架构优于启发式方法，训练后的智能体在优化检索延迟方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多深度存储系统中异构物品的检索问题，通过结合GNN和Transformer模型，不仅提高了系统灵活性，还能适应不同布局的存储系统。

Abstract: In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast
delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine
high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage
and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater
storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during
retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate
this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single
lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of
multi-deep storage systems.
  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to
address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous
item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the
objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's
topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both
item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep
warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network
architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer
model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into
embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these
embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong
generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage
systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including
comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in
optimizing retrieval tardiness.

TL;DR: AZT1D数据集填补了1型糖尿病管理领域高质量公开数据的空白，包含25名患者的详细监测数据，支持AI/ML应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量的公开数据集限制了1型糖尿病（T1D）管理中数据驱动方法的发展，如个性化治疗设计和血糖预测模型。

Method: 收集了25名使用自动胰岛素输送（AID）系统的T1D患者6至8周的连续血糖监测、胰岛素泵数据、碳水化合物摄入和设备模式等详细信息。

Result: AZT1D数据集提供了现有数据集中罕见的详细胰岛素输送数据，支持广泛的AI和机器学习应用。

Conclusion: AZT1D数据集通过提供丰富的自然数据，有助于改善T1D的临床决策和个体化护理。

Abstract: High quality real world datasets are essential for advancing data driven
approaches in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management, including personalized therapy
design, digital twin systems, and glucose prediction models. However, progress
in this area has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available datasets
that offer detailed and comprehensive patient data. To address this gap, we
present AZT1D, a dataset containing data collected from 25 individuals with T1D
on automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. AZT1D includes continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) data, insulin pump and insulin administration data,
carbohydrate intake, and device mode (regular, sleep, and exercise) obtained
over 6 to 8 weeks for each patient. Notably, the dataset provides granular
details on bolus insulin delivery (i.e., total dose, bolus type, correction
specific amounts) features that are rarely found in existing datasets. By
offering rich, naturalistic data, AZT1D supports a wide range of artificial
intelligence and machine learning applications aimed at improving clinical
decision making and individualized care in T1D.

*Tianxiang Zhan,Ming Jin,Yuanpeng He,Yuxuan Liang,Yong Deng,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为连续进化池（CEP）的机制，用于处理时间序列中的周期性概念漂移问题，通过存储不同概念的预测器实例并动态更新，显著提高了在线预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 周期性概念漂移是时间序列中最常见的概念漂移类型之一，现有解决方案通过参数更新技术延缓遗忘，但可能导致部分已学知识的丢失，且缺乏知识保留机制的探索。

Method: 论文提出了连续进化池（CEP）机制，存储不同概念的预测器实例，通过检索最近的预测器并学习其邻近样本的特征来处理周期性概念漂移，同时引入淘汰机制清除过时知识。

Result: 在不同架构模型和八个真实数据集上的实验表明，CEP能有效保留不同概念的知识，在周期性概念出现的在线预测场景中显著提升了预测效果。

Conclusion: CEP机制通过动态存储和更新预测器实例，有效解决了周期性概念漂移问题，显著提高了在线预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recurring concept drift, a type of concept drift in which previously observed
data patterns reappear after some time, is one of the most prevalent types of
concept drift in time series. As time progresses, concept drift occurs and
previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in
the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter
updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss
of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of
knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully
utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool
(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for
different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test
sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we
refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it
indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the
current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.
Simultaneously, the elimination mechanism will enable outdated knowledge to be
cleared to ensure the prediction effect of the forecasters. Experiments on
different architectural models and eight real datasets demonstrate that CEP
effectively retains the knowledge of different concepts. In the scenario of
online forecasting with recurring concepts, CEP significantly enhances the
prediction results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在ESM2等蛋白质语言模型中，推理时在特征提取层和转换层之间注入dropout层，并通过类似蒙特卡洛dropout的方法平均输出，可以提高ProteinGym数据集子集上的零样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不重新训练或微调蛋白质语言模型的情况下，通过简单的技术改进零样本预测性能。

Method: 在推理阶段，在蛋白质语言模型的特征提取层和转换层之间注入一个dropout层，并通过多次采样平均输出，类似于蒙特卡洛dropout方法。

Result: 实验表明，即使模型最初训练时未使用dropout，这种方法仍能提高零样本预测性能，且dropout率为0.1时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 推理时注入dropout层是一种简单有效的方法，可以提升蛋白质语言模型在零样本预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs) such as ESM2 have been shown to be capable of
zero-shot prediction of critical scalar properties of proteins (fitness). In
this work, we show that injecting a dropout layer at inference time between a
PLM's featurizer/embedding layer and its transformer, and averaging its output
akin to Monte-Carlo dropout increases zero-shot performance on a subset of the
ProteinGym dataset. This is the case even when the model was not trained with
dropouts to begin with, and does not require retraining or finetuning of the
PLM. A dropout of 0.1 seems performant across all models.

*Henrik Klagges,Robert Dahlke,Fabian Klemm,Benjamin Merkel,Daniel Klingmann,David A. Reiss,Dan Zecha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'Assembly-of-Experts'（AoE）的新方法，用于高效创建混合专家模型的子模型变体，显著降低了计算成本并保持了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型（LLM）需要极高的计算成本（10^13-10^15 FLOPs/权重），效率低下。为了更有效利用预训练模型的巨大投资，开发了AoE方法。

Method: 通过线性时间内的权重张量插值，从现有的混合专家父模型生成子模型变体，可以增强或抑制父模型的语义特征。

Result: 生成的DeepSeek R1T 'Chimera'模型（671B参数）继承了父模型的专家张量，性能接近R1水平，同时输出token减少40%，推理速度接近V3。

Conclusion: AoE方法无需微调或蒸馏即可生成功能强大且高效的子模型，为模型空间探索提供了简单直接的途径。

Abstract: Requiring $10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ FLOPs to calculate one 8 bit weight in an LLM
during pretraining is extremely expensive and seems inefficient. To better
leverage the huge investments made into pretrained models, we develop the new
"Assembly-of-Experts" (AoE) construction method to create capable child
variants of existing Mixture-of-Experts parent models in linear time. Model
weight tensors get interpolated individually, allowing to enhance or suppress
semantic features of the parents.
  Varying the proportion of weights taken from the parent models, we observe
some properties of the AoE child model changing gradually, while other
behavioral traits emerge with a sharp transition. Surprisingly, nearly every
generated model is functional and capable, which makes searching the model
space straightforward.
  We construct the DeepSeek R1T "Chimera", a 671B open-weights hybrid model
combining DeepSeek's V3-0324 and R1 model variants. The child inherits only the
routed expert tensors of R1, but still achieves about R1-level intelligence. At
the same time, it uses about 40\% fewer output tokens, close to V3 speed.
Constructed without any fine-tuning or distillation, the Chimera exhibits
surprisingly compact, orderly reasoning compared to its parent models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能系统需要同时支持广泛泛化和精确识别的内部表示，但这两者之间存在权衡。论文旨在探索这种权衡的基本限制及其在不同模型中的表现。

Method: 通过理论分析，推导了泛化概率和识别概率的闭式表达式，并扩展到噪声和异构空间。同时，通过训练简单的ReLU网络和复杂模型（如CNN和视觉-语言模型）进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析揭示了泛化与识别的Pareto前沿，实验表明有限语义分辨率是普遍存在的信息约束，且多输入处理能力会急剧下降。

Conclusion: 论文提供了泛化-识别权衡的精确理论，并证明有限语义分辨率是深度网络和大脑中普遍存在的信息约束，与输入空间几何无关。

Abstract: Intelligent systems must deploy internal representations that are
simultaneously structured -- to support broad generalization -- and selective
-- to preserve input identity. We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff.
For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with
finite semantic resolution $\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions
that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification
$p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry.
Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs
predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a
non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end
reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and
empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for
linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits
persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network
and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that
finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational
constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact. Together, these results provide an
exact theory of the generalization-identification trade-off and clarify how
semantic resolution shapes the representational capacity of deep networks and
brains alike.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Transformer的模型在时间序列预测中存在计算复杂度高的问题，且难以有效捕捉复杂的时间模式和语义信息。ss-Mamba旨在提供一种计算效率更高且性能可比的替代方案。

Method: ss-Mamba采用选择性状态空间模型（Mamba）替代Transformer，结合预训练语言模型的语义嵌入和基于样条的KAN网络，动态捕捉时间序列的季节性和非平稳特征。

Result: 实验表明，ss-Mamba在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上均优于传统Transformer模型，同时显著降低了计算复杂度（从二次降至线性）。

Conclusion: ss-Mamba作为一种高效且多功能的时间序列预测模型，为传统Transformer提供了有竞争力的替代方案，尤其适用于需要语义理解和复杂时间模式的任务。

Abstract: We propose ss-Mamba, a novel foundation model that enhances time series
forecasting by integrating semantic-aware embeddings and adaptive spline-based
temporal encoding within a selective state-space modeling framework. Building
upon the recent success of Transformer architectures, ss-Mamba adopts the Mamba
selective state space model as an efficient alternative that achieves
comparable performance while significantly reducing computational complexity
from quadratic to linear time. Semantic index embeddings, initialized from
pretrained language models, allow effective generalization to previously unseen
series through meaningful semantic priors. Additionally, spline-based
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) dynamically and interpretably capture complex
seasonalities and non-stationary temporal effects, providing a powerful
enhancement over conventional temporal feature encodings. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that ss-Mamba delivers superior accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability, demonstrating its capability as a versatile
and computationally efficient alternative to traditional Transformer-based
models in time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 研究连续微分方程是分析离散优化方法的有力途径，但动量在梯度优化中的关键作用与离散化误差导致的动力学差异尚未被充分研究。本文旨在通过更精确的离散误差控制，为这一领域提供新的理论工具。

Method: 设计了一阶分段连续微分方程，通过添加补偿项显式处理离散误差，构建了允许任意步长阶次误差控制的HB动量方法连续时间模型。

Result: 提出了可精确控制离散误差的连续时间HB模型，并发现方向平滑性的新隐式正则化，揭示了HB在深度学习中（如对角线性网络）的隐式偏好。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模离散误差，本文为动量方法提供了更精确的连续时间分析框架，其理论成果可直接应用于深度学习优化器的设计与理解。

Abstract: This paper establishes a continuous time approximation, a piece-wise
continuous differential equation, for the discrete Heavy-Ball (HB) momentum
method with explicit discretization error. Investigating continuous
differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete
optimization methods. Despite the crucial role of momentum in gradient-based
optimization methods, the gap between the original discrete dynamics and the
continuous time approximations due to the discretization error has not been
comprehensively bridged yet. In this work, we study the HB momentum method in
continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide
additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a
first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number
of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a
result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that
allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.
As an application, we leverage it to find a new implicit regularization of the
directional smoothness and investigate the implicit bias of HB for diagonal
linear networks, indicating how our results can be used in deep learning. Our
theoretical findings are further supported by numerical experiments.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)结合了视觉模态和大型语言模型(LLMs)，而LLMs对提示词敏感。研究旨在确定VLMs是否也继承这种不稳定性，并分析哪些提示变化对VLMs影响最大。

Method: 提出PARC框架，包含三个核心：(1)语言和视觉领域的合理提示变化，(2)具有内置保证的新模型可靠性评分，(3)校准步骤，支持跨数据集和提示的分析。

Result: 评估显示VLMs在视觉领域对语言提示的敏感性与LLMs相似，最具破坏性的提示变化会改变预期答案。在22个模型中，InternVL2家族表现出色。

Conclusion: 提示敏感性可能与训练数据有关，InternVL2家族模型对提示变化最具鲁棒性。PARC框架为分析VLMs的提示敏感性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) respond to user-crafted text prompts and visual
inputs, and are applied to numerous real-world problems. VLMs integrate visual
modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be
prompt-sensitive. Hence, it is crucial to determine whether VLMs inherit this
instability to varying prompts. We therefore investigate which prompt
variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to
prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via
Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built
on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and
vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees,
and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt
variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that
VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most
destructive variations change the expected answer. Regarding models,
outstandingly robust VLMs among 22 evaluated models come from the InternVL2
family. We further find indications that prompt sensitivity is linked to
training data. The code will be at https://github.com/NVlabs/PARC.

Conclusion: 智能、自适应的AI方法能显著提升供应链预测精度，减少缺货和过剩库存。

Abstract: Sparse and intermittent demand forecasting in supply chains presents a
critical challenge, as frequent zero-demand periods hinder traditional model
accuracy and impact inventory management. We propose and evaluate a
Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting
model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its
unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime
routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies,
effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand
regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita
dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting
accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with
4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision
will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess
inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in
optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.

Result: p-拉普拉斯模型在仅使用10%训练数据时，对ALM、BMD和BFP的预测误差分别为13%、10%和20%；监督算法SVR在80%数据下对ALM/BMD误差约8%，LS-SVR对BFP误差约11%。

Conclusion: p-拉普拉斯模型在数据受限的医疗场景中展现出应用潜力，为DXA扫描提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of anthropometric body composition variables, such as
Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM), Body Fat Percentage (BFP), and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD), is essential for early diagnosis of several chronic diseases.
Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to
measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This
work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine
learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc)
obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was
sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data
in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However,
most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive,
requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we
implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This
paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for
regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\sim13\%$ for ALM,
$\sim10\%$ for BMD, and $\sim20\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for
10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support
Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of
$\sim 8\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with
$\sim 11\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data. Our findings position
the $p$-Laplacian model as a promising tool for healthcare applications,
particularly in a data-constrained environment.

*Sunil Kumar,Bowen Zhao,Leo Dirac,Paulina Varshavskaya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过GRPO训练小规模视觉语言模型，结合外部工具（如缩放）来提升视觉问答任务性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型模型在推理能力上取得了显著进展，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）在计算资源有限的情况下仍难以进行细致的视觉推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）训练小规模模型，结合简单的奖励结构、简化的工具调用接口、为工具调用结果分配额外token，以及过采样视觉难度较高的训练数据。

Result: 与规模相当的基线模型相比，该方法在某些视觉问答（VQA）任务上表现更优，得益于从外部工具获取的详细视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过GRPO训练和外部工具的结合，小规模视觉语言模型能够更有效地进行细致的视觉推理，提升视觉问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNano是一个创新的联邦学习框架，通过集中大型语言模型在服务器端并引入轻量级NanoEdge模块，解决了多模态大模型在联邦学习中的部署难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在实际部署中面临分布式多模态数据和严格隐私要求的挑战。联邦学习（FL）虽提供了一种解决方案，但现有方法假设客户端部署完整模型，这对大规模MLLMs不切实际。

Method: 提出FedNano框架，将LLM集中在服务器端，客户端引入轻量级NanoEdge模块，包含特定模态编码器、连接器和可训练的NanoAdapters，采用低秩适应技术。

Result: FedNano显著减少客户端存储需求（降低95%）和通信开销（仅模型参数的0.01%），在异构数据和资源限制下表现优于现有FL基线。

Conclusion: FedNano成功弥合了MLLMs规模与FL可行性之间的差距，为可扩展、去中心化的多模态AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in tasks like multimodal
reasoning and cross-modal retrieval but face deployment challenges in
real-world scenarios due to distributed multimodal data and strict privacy
requirements. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling
collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL
for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational
demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and
heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of
full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their
massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we
propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server
while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific
adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and
trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the
need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and
limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By
transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous
client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy. Experiments
demonstrate that FedNano outperforms prior FL baselines, bridging the gap
between MLLM scale and FL feasibility, and enabling scalable, decentralized
multimodal AI systems.

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了四种替代模型在高熵合金(HEAs)性能预测中的表现，发现深度高斯过程(DGP)结合机器学习先验优于其他模型，能有效捕捉属性间关联和输入依赖性不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高熵合金(HEAs)的发现和优化需要高效建模技术，以整合计算预测与稀疏实验数据，加速材料设计。

Method: 研究比较了传统高斯过程(cGP)、深度高斯过程(DGP)、多输出回归的编码器-解码器神经网络和XGBoost在AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA系统中的性能预测能力。

Result: DGP模型在预测相关材料性能（如屈服强度、硬度等）时表现最佳，尤其擅长处理材料信息学中常见的异方差、异构和不完整数据。

Conclusion: 先进的替代模型（如DGP）能显著提升预测精度，为高效稳健的材料设计提供有力工具。

Abstract: Surrogate modeling techniques have become indispensable in accelerating the
discovery and optimization of high-entropy alloys(HEAs), especially when
integrating computational predictions with sparse experimental observations.
This study systematically evaluates the fitting performance of four prominent
surrogate models conventional Gaussian Processes(cGP), Deep Gaussian
Processes(DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and
XGBoost applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational
properties in the AlCoCrCuFeMnNiV HEA system. We specifically assess their
capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield
strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average
hardness under dynamic and quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary
computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of
hierarchical and deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic,
heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials informatics.
Our findings illustrate that DGP infused with machine learning-based prior
outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property
correlations and input-dependent uncertainty. This enhanced predictive accuracy
positions advanced surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and
data-efficient materials design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合双向GRU和多头注意力机制的混合模型（BiGRU-MHA），用于提高SSD健康状态预测的准确性和稳定性，实验结果显示模型具有优异的分类性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSD健康状态预测对数据可靠性保障至关重要，传统模型存在泛化瓶颈，因此需要一种更准确、稳定的预测方法以支持工业级存储系统的预防性维护。

Method: 提出BiGRU-MHA模型，利用双向GRU网络捕捉SSD退化特征的前后依赖关系，并通过多头注意力机制动态分配特征权重，增强对关键健康指标的敏感性。

Result: 模型在训练集和测试集上的分类准确率分别为92.70%和92.44%，性能差距仅0.26%，测试集AUC达0.94，展现了优异的泛化能力和二分类性能。

Conclusion: 该模型为SSD健康预测提供了新技术方案，解决了传统模型的泛化瓶颈，可显著降低数据丢失风险并优化维护成本，适用于云计算数据中心和边缘存储环境。

Abstract: Aiming at the critical role of SSD health state prediction in data
reliability assurance, this study proposes a hybrid BiGRU-MHA model that
incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and
stability of storage device health classification. The model innovatively
integrates temporal feature extraction and key information focusing
capabilities. Specifically, it leverages the bidirectional timing modeling
advantages of the BiGRU network to capture both forward and backward
dependencies of SSD degradation features. Simultaneously, the multi-head
attention mechanism dynamically assigns feature weights, improving the model's
sensitivity to critical health indicators. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves classification accuracies of 92.70% on the training set
and 92.44% on the test set, with a minimal performance gap of only 0.26%,
demonstrating excellent generalization ability. Further analysis using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows an area under the curve
(AUC) of 0.94 on the test set, confirming the model's robust binary
classification performance. This work not only presents a new technical
approach for SSD health prediction but also addresses the generalization
bottleneck of traditional models, offering a verifiable method with practical
value for preventive maintenance of industrial-grade storage systems. The
results show the model can significantly reduce data loss risks by providing
early failure warnings and help optimize maintenance costs, supporting
intelligent decision-making in building reliable storage systems for cloud
computing data centers and edge storage environments.

TL;DR: 机器学习在医疗领域应用广泛，但数据不完整和模型透明度不足影响效果。针对老年性黄斑变性（AMD）的诊断，提出CACTUS工具，提升分类准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据常不完整且模型缺乏透明度，影响机器学习在疾病分类中的效果。AMD早期诊断至关重要，但现有方法未充分考虑多因素。

Method: 开发CACTUS工具，整合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计因素，提供可解释的AMD分类模型。

Result: CACTUS优于标准机器学习模型，能识别关键因素并减少偏差，提升决策信心。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过增强可解释性和数据筛选，为AMD诊断提供更可靠工具，促进临床反馈和偏差修正。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的单类支持向量机（OC-SVM）方法GRKneg，利用少量负样本优化核函数，在小规模单类分类任务中表现优于标准OC-SVM和二元SVM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小规模单类分类问题，当仅有少量负样本可用时，如何有效利用这些负样本提升分类性能是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出GRKneg方法，通过选择和生成参考向量改进核函数，利用负样本数据优化OC-SVM的核函数，但不使用标签进行模型优化。

Result: GRKneg在少量负样本情况下明显优于标准OC-SVM和二元SVM，但当负样本充足时，二元SVM表现更好。

Conclusion: GRKneg是一种有效的小规模单类分类方法，特别适用于负样本稀缺的场景。

Abstract: This paper focuses on small-scale one-class classification with some negative
samples available. We propose Generalized Reference Kernel with Negative
Samples (GRKneg) for One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM). We study
different ways to select/generate the reference vectors and recommend an
approach for the problem at hand. It is worth noting that the proposed method
does not use any labels in the model optimization but uses the original OC-SVM
implementation. Only the kernel used in the process is improved using the
negative data. We compare our method with the standard OC-SVM and with the
binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) using different amounts of negative
samples. Our approach consistently outperforms the standard OC-SVM using Radial
Basis Function kernel. When there are plenty of negative samples, the binary
SVM outperforms the one-class approaches as expected, but we show that for the
lowest numbers of negative samples the proposed approach clearly outperforms
the binary SVM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个事件驱动的在线垂直联邦学习框架，解决了数据异步到达和非凸模型在非平稳环境中的挑战，显著降低了通信和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）中，在线学习比离线学习更适应现实场景，但由于VFL中客户端拥有相同样本的非交集特征集，且数据通常由仅与部分客户端相关的事件生成，导致数据异步到达，现有研究未充分解决这些挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一个事件驱动的在线VFL框架，其中每次事件仅激活部分客户端，其余客户端被动协作学习，并引入动态局部遗憾（DLR）来处理非凸模型在非平稳环境中的问题。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在非平稳数据条件下比现有在线VFL框架更稳定，同时显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线VFL提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案，解决了数据异步和非凸模型带来的挑战。

Abstract: Online learning is more adaptable to real-world scenarios in Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL) compared to offline learning. However, integrating
online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL,
where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In
real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the
disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are
typically generated by an \emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We
are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been
overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an
event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients
were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively
collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated
\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by
online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary
environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed
framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with
event-driven online VFL. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed
framework was more stable than the existing online VFL framework under
non-stationary data conditions while also significantly reducing communication
and computation costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦黑盒提示调优研究忽视了云端大型语言模型服务的高查询成本问题，因此需要一种更高效的查询方法。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出FedOne框架，每轮仅激活一个客户端，以最大化查询效率。

Result: 实验表明，FedOne在查询效率上有显著提升，与理论分析结果一致。

Conclusion: FedOne是一种高效的联邦黑盒离散提示学习方法，适用于云端大型语言模型的提示调优。

Abstract: Black-Box Discrete Prompt Learning is a prompt-tuning method that optimizes
discrete prompts without accessing model parameters or gradients, making the
prompt tuning on a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) feasible. Adapting
federated learning to BDPL could further enhance prompt tuning performance by
leveraging data from diverse sources. However, all previous research on
federated black-box prompt tuning had neglected the substantial query cost
associated with the cloud-based LLM service. To address this gap, we conducted
a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated
black-box prompt tuning. Our findings revealed that degrading FedAvg to
activate only one client per round, a strategy we called \textit{FedOne},
enabled optimal query efficiency in federated black-box prompt learning.
Building on this insight, we proposed the FedOne framework, a federated
black-box discrete prompt learning method designed to maximize query efficiency
when interacting with cloud-based LLMs. We conducted numerical experiments on
various aspects of our framework, demonstrating a significant improvement in
query efficiency, which aligns with our theoretical results.

Conclusion: 自动定义分类阈值的机器学习方法能有效提升自编码器异常检测系统的性能。

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using
Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the
data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized
separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the
definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection
process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold
using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were
evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.

Abstract: The loss landscapes of neural networks contain minima and saddle points that
may be connected in flat regions or appear in isolation. We identify and
characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which
the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two
neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\pm$infinity, and their input weight
vectors, $\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At
convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit:
$a_i\sigma(\mathbf{w_i} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + a_j\sigma(\mathbf{w_j} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow \sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) + (\mathbf{v} \cdot
\mathbf{x}) \sigma'(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these
channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of
critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like
SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression
settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with
finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture
of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and
functional interpretation. The emergence of gated linear units at the end of
the channels highlights a surprising aspect of the computational capabilities
of fully connected layers.

Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦数学和代码领域，缺乏对强化学习（RL）在通用推理中适用性的系统探索，且跨领域可靠奖励信号稀缺。

Method: 构建含92K样本的Guru数据集，涵盖数学、代码等六大领域，通过领域特定奖励设计、去重和过滤确保RL训练质量；基于此重新评估RL对LLM推理的影响。

Result: 发现RL效果因预训练数据暴露程度而异：高频领域（数学/代码/科学）可跨领域受益，低频领域（逻辑/模拟/表格）需领域内训练；Guru模型在17项任务上超越基线7.9%/6.7%。

Conclusion: RL能促进真实技能获取（尤其低频领域），发布的Guru模型和资源可推动通用推理研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法DIS²在估计机器学习模型在未见测试域中的误差时，存在在源域和目标域重叠区域竞争的问题，导致误差估计不够准确。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD)的新方法，通过仅要求在非重叠目标域中最大化分类器分歧，避免了重叠区域的竞争，并使用域分类器来估计域重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，ODD方法在多个基准测试中显著提高了性能估计的准确性，同时保持了方法的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: ODD方法通过优化非重叠目标域的分类器分歧，显著改进了分布偏移下的误差估计性能，为安全智能系统提供了更可靠的误差估计工具。

Abstract: Reliable and accurate estimation of the error of an ML model in unseen test
domains is an important problem for safe intelligent systems. Prior work uses
disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under
distribution shifts. It optimizes for a maximally disagreeing classifier on the
target domain to bound the error of a given source classifier. Although this
approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target
error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement
discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and
target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement
should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to
high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD).
Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain,
removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to
estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2. We
conduct experiments on a wide array of benchmarks to show that our method
improves the overall performance-estimation error while remaining valid and
reliable. Our code and results are available on GitHub.

Result: 尽管早期预测难度大（AUROC 0.63），但通过先进模型整合数字数据提升了性能。多模态Transformer表现最佳，证实了结合临床与数字数据的优势。

Conclusion: 基础模型和多模态方法能从复杂多样的临床和数字数据中提取预测信号，为MS及其他复杂疾病提供更精准的预后。

Abstract: Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is
challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week
disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital
Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed
state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom
multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite
the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via
advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer
model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but
our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart,
confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings
demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive
signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g.,
imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially
other complex diseases.

Abstract: We propose a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) framework aimed at

framework that strategically gathers information about selected arms before
allocation. In the offline setting, where reward distributions are known, we
leverage submodular properties to design a greedy probing algorithm with a
provable performance bound. For the more complex online setting, we develop an
algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while maintaining fairness. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach
outperforms baseline methods, achieving better fairness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用控制微分方程（CDE）进行脓毒症治疗的强化学习状态表征，强调训练稳定性和临床相关性对策略性能的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脓毒症治疗的强化学习方法在从ICU不规则时间序列中学习稳定且具有临床意义的状态表征方面存在不足，尤其是训练不稳定性对策略性能的负面影响未被充分研究。

Method: 采用控制微分方程（CDE）进行状态表征，通过早停或稳定化方法确保训练稳定性，并通过与临床评分（SOFA、SAPS-II、OASIS）的相关性正则化实现敏锐感知的表征。

Result: 在MIMIC-III脓毒症数据集上，稳定的CDE自编码器生成的表征与临床评分强相关，并实现了优越的策略性能（WIS回报>0.9），而不稳定的表征导致策略失败（WIS回报~0）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在临床强化学习中，使用CDE编码不规则医疗时间序列时训练稳定性的重要性，并提供了实用的指导原则。

Abstract: Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on
learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU
time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for
this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential
representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been
overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE)
state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are
met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization
methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation
regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the
MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces
representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies
with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE
representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return
$\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only
separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity
score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.
These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode
irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training
stability in sequential representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出SFT-GO方法，通过按重要性分组优化令牌，提升大语言模型在监督微调中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法平等对待所有令牌，忽略了关键令牌的重要性，导致模型学习效率不足。

Method: SFT-GO根据令牌重要性分组，结合最差组损失和标准交叉熵损失进行优化，自适应强调关键令牌。

Result: 实验表明，SFT-GO在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，且适用于不同数据集和基础模型。

Conclusion: SFT-GO通过分组优化策略有效提升模型性能，具有鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become an essential step in tailoring large
language models (LLMs) to align with human expectations and specific downstream
tasks. However, existing SFT methods typically treat each training instance as
a uniform sequence, giving equal importance to all tokens regardless of their
relevance. This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains
critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce
Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that
treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups
tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM
using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard
cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging
token groups and guides the model to better handle different group
distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a
theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its
efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping
strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform
baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks. These improvements hold
across various datasets and base models, demonstrating the robustness and the
effectiveness of our method.

### [100] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了词汇量对大型语言模型训练动态的影响，提出了在词汇量增大时训练动态会从μP机制过渡到LV机制，并验证了嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最佳比例应接近√width。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有μP理论假设输入维度（词汇量）固定，但实际中词汇量远大于模型宽度。本文旨在探讨词汇量对训练动态的影响，弥补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 通过理论分析词汇量对训练动态的影响，提出LV机制，并通过实验验证嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最佳比例。

Result: 实验表明，在LV机制下，嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率的最佳比例应接近√width，与μP预测的width比例不同，且更符合实际观察。

Conclusion: 词汇量的增大会导致训练动态从μP机制过渡到LV机制，此时应采用√width比例调整学习率，这对大型语言模型的预训练具有实际指导意义。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在神经架构搜索和超参数优化中因高昂的时间和计算成本难以广泛应用，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: SPG（Sequential Policy Gradient）通过扩展基础模型并添加临时模块，实现单次前向传递生成填充轨迹，替代传统策略梯度方法。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO、GLUE、SQuAD和SUPERB五个数据集上测试，SPG使模型性能提升0.2%~7%，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: SPG是一种高效、轻量级的超参数优化方法，适用于多种任务，具有工业应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is essential for neural architecture search and
hyperparameter optimization, but the conventional approaches impede widespread
use due to prohibitive time and computational costs. Inspired by DeepSeek-V3
multi-token prediction architecture, we propose Sequential Policy Gradient
modeling (SPG), a novel trajectory generation paradigm for lightweight online
hyperparameter optimization. In contrast to conventional policy gradient
methods, SPG extends the base model with temporary modules, enabling it to
generate state-action (padded) trajectories in a single forward pass. Our
experiments demonstrate that models gain performance when retrained with SPG on
their original datasets and also outperform standard transfer fine-tuning. We
evaluate on five datasets spanning computer vision (ImageNet, COCO), natural
language processing (GLUE, SQuAD), and audio (SUPERB) to assess the industrial
applicability of SPG. The proposed method demonstrates consistent improvements
across widely adopted models, achieving performance gains of $+0.2\sim7\%$,
with significantly low computational costs. Fully reproducible code and

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important
research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has
demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation
remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a
theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family
of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to
Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the
theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with
decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces
a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only
demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to
natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$,
allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and
constrained optimization algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络训练面临非凸优化和超参数调优困难，且常忽视关键应用的$L^{\infty}$误差。

Method: 采用分阶段训练技术，通过额外网络逐步学习预测残差，结合残差结构优化损失函数和自适应采样策略。

Result: 在多个基准问题上验证了框架的有效性，显著提升了模型整体精度。

Conclusion: HiPreNets框架通过渐进式残差学习解决了复杂问题中的高精度建模挑战。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful tools for solving nonlinear problems in
science and engineering, but training highly accurate models becomes
challenging as problem complexity increases. Non-convex optimization and
numerous hyperparameters to tune make performance improvement difficult, and
traditional approaches often prioritize minimizing mean squared error (MSE)
while overlooking $L^{\infty}$ error, which is the critical focus in many
applications. To address these challenges, we present a progressive framework
for training and tuning high-precision neural networks (HiPreNets). Our
approach refines a previously explored staged training technique for neural
networks that improves an existing fully connected neural network by
sequentially learning its prediction residuals using additional networks,
leading to improved overall accuracy. We discuss how to take advantage of the
structure of the residuals to guide the choice of loss function, number of
parameters to use, and ways to introduce adaptive data sampling techniques. We
validate our framework's effectiveness through several benchmark problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）作为具身智能体的认知核心时，其固有的幻觉问题（如无法将用户指令与现实环境对齐）会导致导航错误。论文旨在量化幻觉发生率、分析触发因素，并探索现有模型的应对能力。

Method: 通过在现有基准上构建幻觉探测集（可诱发高达40倍基础提示的幻觉率），评估了12个模型在两种仿真环境中的表现，重点关注模型对不可行任务的处理能力。

Result: 研究发现：1）模型虽能展示推理能力，但无法解决场景-任务不一致性；2）在特定条件下幻觉率显著升高；3）提供了各场景下理想模型行为的可操作建议。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在具身任务中存在处理不可行场景的根本性局限，需开发更鲁棒的规划策略。研究为改进模型可靠性提供了实证基础和设计指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive
core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from
failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can
lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not
exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations
in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task
inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur,
what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To
achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an
existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher
than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we
find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task
inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible
tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each
scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning
strategies.

Motivation: 现代智能交通系统依赖精确的时空交通分析，但传感器故障和异构数据缺失阻碍了可靠的交通建模。

Method: 提出NCPF模型，将CP分解嵌入神经网络架构，通过可学习的嵌入投影和分层特征融合机制建模多线性交互和非线性时空耦合。

Result: 在六个城市交通数据集上的实验表明，NCPF优于六种最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: NCPF通过结合CP分解的可解释性与神经网络的非线性表达能力，为高维交通数据填补提供了灵活且可靠的方法，支持下一代交通数字孪生和自适应控制系统。

Abstract: Modern intelligent transportation systems rely on accurate spatiotemporal
traffic analysis to optimize urban mobility and infrastructure resilience.
However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous
sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper
proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes
low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic
data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural
architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic
tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time
intervals, and mobility metrics. A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism
employs Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while
stacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations
to capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban
traffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art
baselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with
neural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet
flexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering
critical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive
traffic control systems.

Abstract: With growing demands for privacy protection, security, and legal compliance
(e.g., GDPR), machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique for
ensuring the controllability and regulatory alignment of machine learning
models. However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively
verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly
executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification
methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing
approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation.
To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine
unlearning verification methods. We propose a taxonomy that organizes current
techniques into two principal categories -- behavioral verification and
parametric verification -- based on the type of evidence used to assess
unlearning fidelity. We examine representative methods within each category,
analyze their underlying assumptions, strengths, and limitations, and identify
potential vulnerabilities in practical deployment. In closing, we articulate a
set of open problems in current verification research, aiming to provide a
foundation for developing more robust, efficient, and theoretically grounded
unlearning verification mechanisms.

Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习方法在结合拜占庭弹性聚合规则和差分隐私机制时，往往导致模型精度显著下降。因此，需要一种新的框架来平衡隐私保护、拜占庭弹性和模型精度。

Conclusion: ImprovDML框架在保证隐私和拜占庭弹性的同时，显著提高了模型精度，为分布式机器学习提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Jointly addressing Byzantine attacks and privacy leakage in distributed
machine learning (DML) has become an important issue. A common strategy
involves integrating Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules with differential
privacy mechanisms. However, the incorporation of these techniques often
results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue,
we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high
model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and
resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient
vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal
(non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each
iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients
for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive
asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter
than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the
notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based
on the Euclidean distance between inputs. We demonstrate that it enables an
improved trade-off between privacy preservation and model accuracy compared to
differential privacy. Finally, numerical simulations validate our theoretical
results.

Conclusion: 通过结合生成行为建模与组合表示，该方法为复杂动物行为如何从基本运动原语的动态组合中涌现提供了简洁且原则性的解释。

Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor primitives to meet
diverse task demands, but existing behavior-segmentation methods oversimplify
this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative
assumptions. To reflect the animal behavior generation procedure, we introduce
skill-based imitation learning (SKIL) for behavior understanding, a
reinforcement learning-based imitation framework that (1) infers interpretable
skill sets, i.e., latent basis functions of behavior, by leveraging
representation learning on transition probabilities, and (2) parameterizes
policies as dynamic mixtures of these skills. We validate our approach on a
simple grid world, a discrete labyrinth, and unconstrained videos of freely
moving animals. Across tasks, it identifies reusable skill components, learns
continuously evolving compositional policies, and generates realistic
trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete models. By
exploiting generative behavior modeling with compositional representations, our
method offers a concise, principled account of how complex animal behaviors
emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor primitives.

Abstract: While there are many applications of ML to scientific problems that look
promising, visuals can be deceiving. For scientific applications, actual
quantitative accuracy is crucial. This work applies the rigor of numerical
analysis for differential equations to machine learning by specifically
quantifying the accuracy of applying different ML techniques to the elementary
1D Poisson differential equation. Beyond the quantity and discretization of
data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the
generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence
rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces
by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a
white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model.
The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically.
Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear
models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural
Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to
the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case.
Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing
generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also
demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models
whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of
black-box models. Our results inform a new cross-validation technique for
measuring generalization in physical systems. We propose applying it to the
Poisson equation as an evaluation benchmark of future methods.

Conclusion: SoKA是一种高效、鲁棒的大规模模型适配方法，显著降低参数需求并保持性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results across
diverse language and reasoning tasks, but full fine-tuning incurs substantial
storage, memory, and computational overhead. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods mitigate these costs by learning only a small subset of
task-specific parameters, yet existing approaches either introduce
inference-time latency (adapter modules), suffer from suboptimal convergence
(randomly initialized low-rank updates), or rely on fixed rank choices that may
not match task complexity (Kronecker-based decompositions).
  We propose SoKA (SVD on Kronecker Adaptation), a novel PEFT strategy that
combines Kronecker-product tensor factorization with SVD-driven initialization
and spectrum-aware dynamic rank selection. Our Kronecker-Product SVD (KPSVD)
procedure extracts principal components of the full weight update into compact
Kronecker factors, while an adaptive rank selection algorithm uses
energy-threshold and elbow-point criteria to prune negligible components.
  Empirical evaluation on LLaMA2-7B across arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K), formal
mathematics (MATH), and code generation (MBPP) demonstrates that SoKA requires
only 0.99M trainable parameters, 25% fewer than LoRA/PiSSA, while matching or
exceeding baseline performance. Moreover, SoKA exhibits faster convergence and
more stable gradients, highlighting its robustness and efficiency for
large-scale model adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning allows each client to keep its data locally when training
machine learning models in a distributed setting. Significant recent research
established the requirements that the input must satisfy in order to guarantee
convergence of the training loop. This line of work uses averaging as the
aggregation rule for the training models. In particular, we are interested in
whether federated learning is robust to Byzantine behavior, and observe and
investigate a tradeoff between the average/centroid and the validity conditions
from distributed computing. We show that the various validity conditions alone
do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that
reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings
due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower
bound of $\min\{\frac{n-t}{t},\sqrt{d}\}$ on the centroid approximation under
box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the
number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and
$d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower
bound by an upper bound of $2\min\{n,\sqrt{d}\}$, by providing a new analysis
for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a
$\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the
existing lower bound in the literature is tight. We show that all presented
bounds can also be achieved in the distributed peer-to-peer setting. We
complement our analytical results with empirical evaluations in federated
stochastic gradient descent and federated averaging settings.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的强大能力主要依赖于其海量训练数据，但这些数据往往未经授权从互联网抓取，侵犯了数据所有者的知识产权。现有的数据集推断（DI）方法需要与受保护数据集分布匹配的私有集，而这在实际中很少可用，限制了DI的适用性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be mainly
attributed to their massive training datasets, which are often scraped from the
internet without respecting data owners' intellectual property rights. Dataset
Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect
dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify
unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to
be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's
distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in
practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address
this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our
approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse
synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we
achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based
completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic
data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration. Extensive experiments on
diverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set
enables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while
maintaining a low false positive rate. This result empowers copyright owners to
make legitimate claims on data usage and demonstrates our method's reliability
for real-world litigations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出DOVA-PATBM框架，通过地理计算优化电动汽车充电站布局，解决城乡差异，提升覆盖率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及，需要数据丰富且地理可扩展的基础设施规划工具，以协调城市、郊区和农村的不同需求。

Method: 结合Voronoi图、图神经网络和贪婪算法，统一处理道路、人口等多源数据，优化充电站选址和容量。

Result: 在乔治亚州的实验中，覆盖范围提升12%，低收入居民充电距离减半，同时满足电网容量限制。

Conclusion: DOVA-PATBM框架有效连接学术优化与可部署政策，适用于全国范围的基础设施规划。

Abstract: The accelerating uptake of battery-electric vehicles demands infrastructure
planning tools that are both data-rich and geographically scalable. Whereas
most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide
and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense
metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural
corridors.
  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,
Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework
that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises
heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)
onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a
zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi
tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within
every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and
floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under
feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage
heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of
sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.
  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile
coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income
residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission
headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for
national-scale roll-outs. These results demonstrate that a tightly integrated,
GNN-driven, multi-resolution approach can bridge the gap between academic
optimisation and deployable infrastructure policy.

Motivation: 跨境电商的快速发展为中小企业带来了机遇，但融资问题仍是主要挑战。由于中小企业信用记录有限，传统的融资方式难以满足需求。因此，研究提出利用第三方物流主导的供应链金融，以在途库存作为抵押，解决融资难题。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has created significant
opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), yet financing
remains a critical challenge due to SMEs' limited credit histories. Third-party
logistics (3PL)-led supply chain finance (SCF) has emerged as a promising
solution, leveraging in-transit inventory as collateral. We propose an advanced
credit risk management framework tailored for 3PL-led SCF, addressing the dual
challenges of credit risk assessment and loan size determination. Specifically,
we leverage conditional generative modeling of sales distributions through
Quantile-Regression-based Generative Metamodeling (QRGMM) as the foundation for
risk estimation. We propose a unified framework that enables flexible
estimation of multiple risk measures while introducing a functional risk
measure formulation that systematically captures the relationship between these
risk measures and varying loan levels, supported by theoretical guarantees. To
capture complex covariate interactions in e-commerce sales data, we integrate
QRGMM with Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM). Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world data validate the efficacy of our model for credit
risk assessment and loan size determination. This study represents a pioneering
application of generative AI in CBEC SCF risk management, offering a solid
foundation for enhanced credit practices and improved SME access to capital.

Result: 实验表明SecFwT显著提升了效率和隐私保护能力，支持隐私关键应用中LLM的可扩展安全微调。

Conclusion: SecFwT为隐私保护LLM微调提供了高效解决方案，突破了传统MPC方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields, yet their
adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains, such as
healthcare and finance, is constrained by the scarcity of accessible training
data due to stringent privacy requirements. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to
protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has
been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant
computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward
propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary
obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the
substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2)
the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework
designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a
forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations
and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax
attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and
computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers
substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling
scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing molecules against multiple therapeutic targets
remains a profound challenge in drug discovery, particularly due to sparse
rewards and conflicting design constraints. We propose a structured active
learning (AL) paradigm integrating a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) variational
autoencoder (VAE) into iterative loops designed to balance chemical diversity,
molecular quality, and multi-target affinity. Our method alternates between
expanding chemically feasible regions of latent space and progressively
constraining molecules based on increasingly stringent multi-target docking
thresholds. In a proof-of-concept study targeting three related coronavirus
main proteases (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), our approach efficiently
generated a structurally diverse set of pan-inhibitor candidates. We
demonstrate that careful timing and strategic placement of chemical filters
within this active learning pipeline markedly enhance exploration of beneficial
chemical space, transforming the sparse-reward, multi-objective drug design
problem into an accessible computational task. Our framework thus provides a
generalizable roadmap for efficiently navigating complex polypharmacological
landscapes.

Method: 使用二元高斯混合模型（GMM）生成演示数据，分析单层线性注意力模型和多层/循环Transformer的表现，提出通过循环现成的表格基础模型来增强半监督能力。

Result: 多层或循环Transformer能通过隐式构建多项式形式的估计器有效利用未标记数据，且多项式的主导幂随深度指数增长。实验表明该方法显著提升了半监督表格学习的性能。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，多层或循环Transformer能有效利用未标记数据，改进半监督学习性能，为实际应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Motivation: 临床实验室结果在诊断中无处不在，预测未检测项目的异常值有助于早期诊断。血常规检测（CBC）作为最广泛使用的临床程序，结合常规生化检测，提供了一个包含缺失值的表格数据。

Method: 将表格建模问题表述为集合转换问题，源集合包含类似GPT的标签列嵌入及其对应值，目标集合仅包含相同类型的嵌入。该方法无需隐式估计缺失值，并将LLM与表格领域结合。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效处理了缺失值，并在临床实验室数据中实现了显著的预测性能改进，为早期诊断提供了可能。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory results are ubiquitous in any diagnosis making.
Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of
performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early
diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood
Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining
routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that
varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing
values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation
problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding
and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type
embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values
without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the
tabular domain. Applying this method to clinical laboratory data, we achieve an
improvement up to 8% AUC for joint predictions of high uric acid, glucose,
cholesterol, and low ferritin levels.

Abstract: Neural network potentials (NNPs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional
force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Accurate and stable MD
simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data
encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures.
Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as
a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in
material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers,
making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures.
To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a
non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy
landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including
the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework
employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a
dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a
smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene
glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving
comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to
existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT
calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Recent developments in application of deep learning models to acoustic Full
Waveform Inversion (FWI) are marked by the use of diffusion models as prior
distributions for Bayesian-like inference procedures. The advantage of these
methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise
unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based
solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from
diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting
factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the
approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains
unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We
address the issue by employing a Schr\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between
the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate
the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we
extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge
($\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional
Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (c$\text{I}^2\text{SB}$) framework. To
validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the
reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the
observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion
model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function
evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with
supervised learning-based approach. The supplementary code implementing the
algorithms described in this paper can be found in the repository

Conclusion: 通过融合先进MIA技术，可在不牺牲效率的前提下提升黑盒DP审计的准确性，为实际部署提供更可靠的隐私保障评估。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on
the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing
techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent
work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in
white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the
more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during
training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that
there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical
upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches
for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in
the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on
CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes
quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially
maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated strong performance in
generative modeling, particularly in image synthesis, making them a compelling
choice for molecular conformer generation. However, applying DiTs to molecules
introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph
information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and
designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying
sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address
these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing
of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we
introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate
seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different
attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and
SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off
between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard
conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC
achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity. Our results
highlight how architectural choices and symmetry priors affect sample quality
and efficiency, suggesting promising directions for large-scale generative
modeling of molecular structures. Code available at

Abstract: Optimal transport provides a robust framework for comparing probability
distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of
the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been
(i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a
supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for
enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot
account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features
in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often
do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions
with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach
for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space.
Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric,
but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The
learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances,
leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification
tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach
using patient-level scRNA-seq data spanning multiple diseases.

Abstract: Exploration is critical for solving real-world decision-making problems such
as scientific discovery, where the objective is to generate truly novel designs
rather than mimic existing data distributions. In this work, we address the
challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for
exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We
introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over
the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion
model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density
estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome
this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental
connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and
its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror
descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a
pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal
exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent
understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we empirically evaluate our approach on
both synthetic and high-dimensional text-to-image diffusion, demonstrating
promising results.

Abstract: The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is a widely used model for
the spread of information and infectious diseases, particularly non-immunizing
ones, on a graph. Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how
to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While
previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked
to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that
the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we
consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled
by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and
only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split
the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination
strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm
and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph
recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove
that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with
bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective
polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments
on synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and
vaccination algorithms.

TL;DR: 该论文通过系统文献综述提出了一个统一的XAI评估框架VXAI，旨在解决当前可解释AI领域缺乏标准化评估协议和共识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统（如深度神经网络）因其复杂的黑盒特性而缺乏透明度，影响了其可信度。尽管可解释AI（XAI）提供了模型行为的解释，但缺乏标准化的评估方法和指标，导致解释的实用性和可信度难以验证。

Method: 作者遵循PRISMA指南进行了系统文献综述，分析了362篇相关文献，并提出了一个三维分类方案（解释类型、评估上下文、解释质量需求），最终构建了VXAI框架。

Result: 研究汇总了41个功能相似的指标组，并提供了迄今为止最全面、结构化的XAI评估概览。VXAI框架支持系统性指标选择，提升方法间的可比性，并为未来扩展提供灵活基础。

Conclusion: VXAI框架填补了XAI领域评估标准化的空白，为研究人员提供了系统化工具，有助于推动可解释AI的可靠性和实用性发展。

Abstract: Modern AI systems frequently rely on opaque black-box models, most notably
Deep Neural Networks, whose performance stems from complex architectures with
millions of learned parameters. While powerful, their complexity poses a major
challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency.
Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable
explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and
trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the
growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation
protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct
a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a
unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant
publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar
metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization
scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation
quality desiderata. Our framework provides the most comprehensive and
structured overview of VXAI to date. It supports systematic metric selection,
promotes comparability across methods, and offers a flexible foundation for
future extensions.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents continually interact with the
environment and use the feedback to refine their behavior. To guide policy
optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired
objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also
fulfills the task designer's intentions. Recently, significant attention from
both academic and industrial researchers has focused on developing reward
models that not only align closely with the true objectives but also facilitate
policy optimization. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of
reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining
the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an
overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the
source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this
understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling
techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models. Finally, we
conclude by highlighting promising research directions in reward modeling.
Altogether, this survey includes both established and emerging methods, filling
the vacancy of a systematic review of reward models in current literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过多义性特征识别与评分方法，提升了神经网络特征描述的准确性和全面性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的特征描述方法存在两个关键问题：鲁棒性不足和单义性假设（即每个神经元仅编码单一概念），而实际上神经元往往是多义性的。这些限制影响了特征描述的表达能力和对模型内部行为的全面捕捉。

Method: 引入了多义性特征识别与评分方法（PRISM），该框架能够捕捉神经网络特征的固有复杂性，为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述。

Result: 在语言模型上应用PRISM，并通过与现有方法的广泛基准测试，证明PRISM能够生成更准确、更忠实的特征描述，提高了整体描述质量和在多义性情况下的概念捕捉能力。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过解决多义性问题，显著提升了神经网络特征描述的质量和表达能力，为模型行为的理解提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

Motivation: 现实应用中，马尔可夫状态往往部分可观测，现有零样本强化学习方法在此条件下性能下降，需探索改进方案。

Method: 采用基于记忆的架构，针对状态、奖励和动态变化部分可观测的领域进行方法评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于记忆的方法在部分可观测环境下性能优于无记忆基线模型。

Conclusion: 基于记忆的架构能有效缓解部分可观测性对零样本强化学习的影响，提升任务适应能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, under certain assumptions, zero-shot
reinforcement learning (RL) methods can generalise to any unseen task in an
environment after reward-free pre-training. Access to Markov states is one such
assumption, yet, in many real-world applications, the Markov state is only
partially observable. Here, we explore how the performance of standard
zero-shot RL methods degrades when subjected to partially observability, and
show that, as in single-task RL, memory-based architectures are an effective
remedy. We evaluate our memory-based zero-shot RL methods in domains where the
states, rewards and a change in dynamics are partially observed, and show
improved performance over memory-free baselines. Our code is open-sourced via:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的LoX方法，通过外推安全子空间增强大语言模型的安全性，有效抵御微调攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过对齐提升了大语言模型的安全性，但后续微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，即使微调数据看似无害。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)方法，外推对齐大语言模型的安全子空间，增强其安全鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时，攻击成功率绝对降低了11%至54%，同时保持模型对新任务的适应性。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移至更平坦区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，从而显著提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出RHO方法，通过自适应学习同质性模式改进半监督图异常检测，解决了现有方法假设同质性单一的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法假设正常节点具有相似同质性且标记节点能充分代表正常类同质性模式，但现实中正常节点同质性多样，该假设不成立。

Method: RHO包含两个模块：AdaFreq（自适应频率响应滤波器）学习标记正常节点的不同频率成分；GNA（图正态对齐）确保通道内和跨通道同质性表示一致。

Result: 在八个真实GAD数据集上，RHO能有效学习正常节点集中多样且常被低估的同质性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RHO通过自适应学习同质性模式，提升了半监督图异常检测性能，尤其适用于同质性多样的场景。

Abstract: Semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) utilizes a small set of labeled
normal nodes to identify abnormal nodes from a large set of unlabeled nodes in
a graph. Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a
similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent
the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does
not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in
real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily
Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two
novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph
normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters
that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with
varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node
attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise
and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned
by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets
show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily
in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
competing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/RHO.

*Tevin Wang,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule自动从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为奖励，提升强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工设计规则，AutoRule旨在自动化这一过程，提高效率和效果。

Method: AutoRule通过推理模型解释用户偏好，提取候选规则并合成统一规则集，结合语言模型验证器计算辅助奖励。

Result: 使用AutoRule训练的Llama-3-8B模型在AlpacaEval2.0上相对提升28.6%，在MT-Bench子集上提升6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoRule能自动提取与数据集偏好一致的规则，减少奖励作弊，并捕捉不同数据集的独特价值。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的时间序列比较技术，通过简化扭曲路径来突出、量化和可视化关键变换（如位移、压缩和幅度差异），从而增强时间序列比较的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的时间序列比较方法主要关注点对点的对齐，无法有效传达子序列层面的结构关系，使得难以理解时间序列之间的位移、加速或减速等变换。

Method: 提出了一种简化扭曲路径的技术，用于突出和量化时间序列之间的关键变换（如位移、压缩和幅度差异），并通过可视化手段展示子序列之间的匹配关系。

Result: 该方法能够更清晰地展示时间序列子序列之间的匹配关系，显著提升了时间序列比较的直观性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过简化扭曲路径并可视化关键变换，该方法有效解决了传统时间序列比较方法在子序列层面结构关系展示上的不足，为时间序列分析提供了更直观的工具。

Abstract: Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and
classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a
robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is
missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do
not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences.
This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series
shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we
propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight,
quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in
amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match
between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series
comparison.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques map high-dimensional data into
lower-dimensional spaces. Yet, current DR techniques are not designed to
explore semantic structure that is not directly available in the form of
variables or class labels. We introduce a novel user-guided projection
framework for image and text data that enables customizable, interpretable,
data visualizations via zero-shot classification with Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). We enable users to steer projections dynamically via
natural-language guiding prompts, to specify high-level semantic relationships
of interest to the users which are not explicitly present in the data
dimensions. We evaluate our method across several datasets and show that it not
only enhances cluster separation, but also transforms DR into an interactive,
user-driven process. Our approach bridges the gap between fully automated DR
techniques and human-centered data exploration, offering a flexible and
adaptive way to tailor projections to specific analytical needs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）中的密集潜在特征并非训练噪声，而是具有语义意义的模型表示，它们在语言模型计算中发挥功能性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）旨在通过稀疏约束提取语言模型的可解释特征，但许多潜在特征频繁激活（即密集），引发了对这些特征是否为训练过程中不良产物的担忧。本文旨在系统研究这些密集潜在特征的几何结构、功能和起源。

Method: 通过分析密集潜在特征的几何结构和功能，引入分类法对它们进行分类，并研究这些特征在不同层中的演变。

Result: 密集潜在特征倾向于形成对映对，重建残差流中的特定方向，并且它们的子空间消融会抑制新密集特征的出现。此外，密集潜在特征与位置跟踪、上下文绑定、熵调节、字母特定输出信号、词性和主成分重建等功能相关。

Conclusion: 密集潜在特征是语言模型计算中的功能性组成部分，不应被视为训练噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

Motivation: 线性预测器中交互项系数估计在高维数据中容易过拟合，需结构化正则化方法改进。

Result: LIT-LVM在模拟和真实数据上优于弹性网和因子分解机，尤其适用于交互项数量大的场景。

Conclusion: LIT-LVM有效缓解过拟合，提供可解释的低维特征表示，适用于高维数据分析。

Abstract: Some of the simplest, yet most frequently used predictors in statistics and
machine learning use weighted linear combinations of features. Such linear
predictors can model non-linear relationships between features by adding
interaction terms corresponding to the products of all pairs of features. We
consider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction
terms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different
interaction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent
each feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This
low-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization
approach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond
standard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that
our approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to
elastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real
data, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the
number of samples. LIT-LVM also provides low-dimensional latent representations
for features that are useful for visualizing and analyzing their relationships.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后验归因方法在解释深度学习预测时存在非鲁棒性问题，微小的输入扰动可能导致归因图显著变化，而预测结果保持不变，这降低了归因解释的可信度。

Method: 论文引入了一种基于随机平滑的认证框架，将归因任务重新表述为分割问题，并对每个像素的重要性进行认证，以抵御ℓ₂有界扰动。

Result: 在5个ImageNet模型和12种归因方法上的广泛评估表明，该方法生成的认证归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性，适用于下游任务。

Conclusion: 该认证框架为归因方法提供了严格的鲁棒性保证，增强了归因解释的可信度，使其能够在实际应用中可靠使用。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中的信息传播限制问题，特别是时空过度挤压现象，并提出了理论分析和实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络（GNNs）在多个领域取得了显著成功，但其在信息传播能力上存在根本性限制，如过度挤压问题。这一问题在静态图中已有广泛研究，但在时空图神经网络（STGNNs）中尚未被探索。时空维度进一步加剧了这一挑战，因为需要传播的信息量更大。

Method: 论文首先形式化了时空过度挤压问题，并展示了其与静态情况的不同特性。通过理论分析，揭示了卷积STGNNs倾向于从时间上较远的点传播信息，而非时间上较近的点。此外，论文证明了无论是“时间-空间”还是“时间然后空间”处理范式的架构都会受到这一现象的影响。

Result: 研究在合成和真实数据集上验证了理论发现，提供了对STGNNs操作动态的深入理解，并为更有效的设计提供了原则性指导。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和实证验证，揭示了STGNNs中时空过度挤压问题的独特特性，并为未来的架构设计提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, recent theoretical advances have identified fundamental
limitations in their information propagation capabilities, such as
over-squashing, where distant nodes fail to effectively exchange information.
While extensively studied in static contexts, this issue remains unexplored in
Spatiotemporal GNNs (STGNNs), which process sequences associated with graph
nodes. Nonetheless, the temporal dimension amplifies this challenge by
increasing the information that must be propagated. In this work, we formalize
the spatiotemporal over-squashing problem and demonstrate its distinct
characteristics compared to the static case. Our analysis reveals that
counterintuitively, convolutional STGNNs favor information propagation from
points temporally distant rather than close in time. Moreover, we prove that
architectures that follow either time-and-space or time-then-space processing
paradigms are equally affected by this phenomenon, providing theoretical
justification for computationally efficient implementations. We validate our
findings on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing deeper insights into
their operational dynamics and principled guidance for more effective designs.

Motivation: 尽管RAG策略常用于更新LLM的响应，但模型可能仍依赖记忆的训练数据，忽略检索证据，产生受污染的输。需要一种无需模型访问的方法来检测此类行为。

Method: RePCS通过比较仅使用查询的推理路径和使用查询及检索上下文的路径，计算两者输出分布的KL散度，低散度表明检索影响小，可能存在记忆。

Result: 在Prompt-WNQA基准测试中，RePCS的ROC-AUC达到0.918，优于先前方法6.5个百分点，延迟开销低于4.7%。

Conclusion: RePCS提供了一种轻量级的黑盒保障方法，可验证RAG系统是否有效利用检索，特别适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a common strategy for
updating large language model (LLM) responses with current, external
information. However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass
the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce
Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects
such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two
inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a
retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by
computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output
distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal
impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic,
requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single
additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the
KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the
Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result
outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping
latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. RePCS offers a lightweight,
black-box safeguard to verify whether a RAG system meaningfully leverages
retrieval, making it especially valuable in safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 该简化分析使SGD在线性回归中的研究更易理解，有望促进对实际模型训练的进一步优化。

Abstract: Theoretically understanding stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in
overparameterized models has led to the development of several optimization
algorithms that are widely used in practice today. Recent work
by~\citet{zou2021benign} provides sharp rates for SGD optimization in linear
regression using constant learning rate, both with and without tail iterate
averaging, based on a bias-variance decomposition of the risk. In our work, we
provide a simplified analysis recovering the same bias and variance bounds
provided in~\citep{zou2021benign} based on simple linear algebra tools,
bypassing the requirement to manipulate operators on positive semi-definite
(PSD) matrices. We believe our work makes the analysis of SGD on linear
regression very accessible and will be helpful in further analyzing
mini-batching and learning rate scheduling, leading to improvements in the
training of realistic models.

Motivation: 传统输入输出观测不足以在极限下学习一般递归函数类，论文旨在通过引入计算复杂度约束或近似时间边界观测来克服这一学习障碍。

Method: 引入时间边界观测和策略轨迹观测，构建围绕计算代理观测的正式框架，并将其简化为从输入输出学习有理函数。

Result: 在策略轨迹观测下，学习可计算函数简化为学习有理函数，但线性时间可计算函数类不存在可计算或多项式质量特征集。

Conclusion: 通过扩展观测类型和引入计算约束，论文揭示了在更现实条件下学习可计算函数的可能性及其与有限状态转换器推断的联系。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit
by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate
\textit{computational observations} and \textit{restricted input sources}.
Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce
Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the
learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints.
While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of
general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by
imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate
time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around
observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable
functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from
input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state
transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or
polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time
computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了深度强化学习网络扩展性能下降的根源，并通过简单干预措施解决了这一问题，为大规模网络的应用提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Scaling deep reinforcement learning networks is challenging and often results
in degraded performance, yet the root causes of this failure mode remain poorly
understood. Several recent works have proposed mechanisms to address this, but
they are often complex and fail to highlight the causes underlying this
difficulty. In this work, we conduct a series of empirical analyses which
suggest that the combination of non-stationarity with gradient pathologies, due
to suboptimal architectural choices, underlie the challenges of scale. We
propose a series of direct interventions that stabilize gradient flow, enabling
robust performance across a range of network depths and widths. Our
interventions are simple to implement and compatible with well-established
algorithms, and result in an effective mechanism that enables strong
performance even at large scales. We validate our findings on a variety of
agents and suites of environments.

Motivation: Wi-Fi指纹室内定位在实际部署中面临设备异质性和时间变化带来的领域偏移问题，现有方法通常独立处理这些问题，导致泛化能力差和灾难性遗忘。

Method: DAILOC采用多级变分自编码器解耦领域偏移和位置相关特征，并引入记忆引导的类潜在对齐机制来缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DAILOC通过联合处理时间和设备引起的领域偏移，有效提升了室内定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization faces significant challenges
in real-world deployments due to domain shifts arising from device
heterogeneity and temporal variations within indoor environments. Existing
approaches often address these issues independently, resulting in poor
generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting over time. In this
work, we propose DAILOC, a novel domain-incremental learning framework that
jointly addresses both temporal and device-induced domain shifts. DAILOC
introduces a novel disentanglement strategy that separates domain shifts from
location-relevant features using a multi-level variational autoencoder.
Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-guided class latent alignment
mechanism to address the effects of catastrophic forgetting over time.
Experiments across multiple smartphones, buildings, and time instances
demonstrate that DAILOC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving up to 2.74x lower average error and 4.6x lower worst-case error.

Abstract: Indoor localization using deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong accuracy
in mapping Wi-Fi RSS fingerprints to physical locations; however, most existing
DL frameworks function as black-box models, offering limited insight into how
predictions are made or how models respond to real-world noise over time. This
lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of
temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models
for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic
gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor
localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access
points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how
environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This
interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL
systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple
real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show
that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also
improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error,
3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to
prior DL-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Ricci流求解器因全局更新成本高、启发式方法收敛慢或参数敏感，难以满足实时大规模网格平滑需求。

Method: 采用贪婪的校正解码步骤（O(E)时间复杂度）定位最大曲率误差，辅以两个微型神经网络模块动态选择顶点和步长，仅需1K+200参数。

Result: 在110个测试网格上：迭代次数减少2.4倍（950→400），曲率分布更紧密（0.19→0.185），UV失真与主观评分相关性达-0.93，单次迭代仅增加0.25ms，整体加速1.8倍。

Conclusion: MicroRicci以线性时间更新、自适应超参数和高保真几何处理能力，为实时图形/仿真应用提供了资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time mesh smoothing at scale remains a formidable challenge: classical
Ricci-flow solvers demand costly global updates, while greedy heuristics suffer
from slow convergence or brittle tuning. We present MicroRicci, the first truly
self-tuning, local Ricci-flow solver that borrows ideas from coding theory and
packs them into just 1K + 200 parameters. Its primary core is a greedy
syndrome-decoding step that pinpoints and corrects the largest curvature error
in O(E) time, augmented by two tiny neural modules that adaptively choose
vertices and step sizes on the fly. On a diverse set of 110 SJTU-TMQA meshes,
MicroRicci slashes iteration counts from 950+=140 to 400+=80 (2.4x speedup),
tightens curvature spread from 0.19 to 0.185, and achieves a remarkable
UV-distortion-to-MOS correlation of r = -0.93. It adds only 0.25 ms per
iteration (0.80 to 1.05 ms), yielding an end-to-end 1.8x runtime acceleration
over state-of-the-art methods. MicroRicci's combination of linear-time updates,
automatic hyperparameter adaptation, and high-quality geometric and perceptual
results makes it well suited for real-time, resource-limited applications in
graphics, simulation, and related fields.

TL;DR: DP-GRAPE是一种新型差分隐私训练方法，通过梯度随机投影显著降低内存使用，同时保持与DP-SGD相当的隐私-效用平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的差分隐私训练方法（如DP-Adam）由于逐样本梯度裁剪导致高内存开销，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: DP-GRAPE通过三个关键改进实现高效差分隐私训练：（1）投影后私有化梯度，（2）用随机高斯矩阵替代SVD子空间，（3）在反向传播时应用投影。

Result: 实验表明，DP-GRAPE在预训练Vision Transformers和微调RoBERTa-Large时分别减少63%和70%内存使用，且性能与DP-Adam相当，可扩展至67亿参数的OPT模型。

Conclusion: DP-GRAPE在显著降低内存占用的同时，保持了与一阶DP方法相当的效用，为大规模模型差分隐私训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) protects sensitive data during neural network
training, but standard methods like DP-Adam suffer from high memory overhead
due to per-sample gradient clipping, limiting scalability. We introduce
DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly
reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP
approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces
three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2)
random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is
applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for
costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to
improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our
theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off
comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE
can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or
training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when
pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as
compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance. We further
demonstrate that DP-GRAPE scales to fine-tuning large models such as OPT with
up to 6.7 billion parameters.

Motivation: 随着人工智能系统在社会各领域（如医疗和法律判决）的影响日益加深，机器学习公平性对构建可信赖系统至关重要。然而，训练数据中的标签偏差和噪声会影响模型性能和公平性评估，因此需要更鲁棒的公平感知方法。

Conclusion: GFLC是一种高效的方法，能够有效校正标签噪声并保持数据集的公平性，为构建更公平的机器学习系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has a critical importance for building
trustworthy machine learning system as artificial intelligence (AI) systems
increasingly impact various aspects of society, including healthcare decisions
and legal judgments. Moreover, numerous studies demonstrate evidence of unfair
outcomes in ML and the need for more robust fairness-aware methods. However,
the data we use to train and develop debiasing techniques often contains biased
and noisy labels. As a result, the label bias in the training data affects
model performance and misrepresents the fairness of classifiers during testing.
To tackle this problem, our paper presents Graph-based Fairness-aware Label
Correction (GFLC), an efficient method for correcting label noise while
preserving demographic parity in datasets. In particular, our approach combines
three key components: prediction confidence measure, graph-based regularization
through Ricci-flow-optimized graph Laplacians, and explicit demographic parity
incentives. Our experimental findings show the effectiveness of our proposed
approach and show significant improvements in the trade-off between performance
and fairness metrics compared to the baseline.

Abstract: $\textbf{Objective:}$ Brain-predicted age difference (BrainAGE) is a
neuroimaging biomarker reflecting brain health. However, training robust
BrainAGE models requires large datasets, often restricted by privacy concerns.
This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE
estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy,
and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional
outcomes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients
across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep
learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies:
centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and
single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations
between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months
post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for
these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity,
time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and
recanalisation outcome.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate
predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was
significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models.
Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and
multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the
association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data
centralization. The strong association between BrainAGE, vascular risk factors,
and post-stroke recovery highlights its potential for prognostic modeling in
stroke care.

Conclusion: CAWR方法有效解决了AWR在次优数据下的过保守问题，为离线强化学习的策略优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) algorithms often require
additional constraints or penalty terms to address distribution shift issues,
such as adding implicit or explicit policy constraints during policy
optimization to reduce the estimation bias of functions. This paper focuses on
a limitation of the Advantage-Weighted Regression family (AWRs), i.e., the
potential for learning over-conservative policies due to data corruption,
specifically the poor explorations in suboptimal offline data. We study it from
two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal
policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the
approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such
over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for
policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor
explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose
Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a
set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based
prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations. Numerical
experiments on the D4RL benchmark show that our method can learn superior
policies from suboptimal offline data, significantly enhancing the performance
of policy optimization.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在Tsybakov噪声条件和组合假设下的二元分类问题，证明了ReLU深度神经网络在铰链损失下可以达到最优收敛速率，为高维分类任务提供了理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在高维数据下二元分类问题的最优收敛速率，特别是在Tsybakov噪声条件和组合假设下，验证ReLU深度神经网络在实际分类任务中的优异表现。

Method: 通过组合假设和Tsybakov噪声条件，扩展了先前工作中的oracle不等式，分析了ReLU深度神经网络在铰链损失下的收敛速率。

Result: 证明了最优收敛速率与输入维度无关，且ReLU深度神经网络可以达到该速率（对数因子内），为高维分类任务提供了理论保证。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为ReLU深度神经网络在高维分类任务中的表现提供了理论依据，还扩展了oracle不等式的应用范围，具有独立的理论价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the binary classification problem on $[0,1]^d$ under
the Tsybakov noise condition (with exponent $s \in [0,\infty]$) and the
compositional assumption. This assumption requires the conditional class
probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$
vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a
maximum value function or a H\"{o}lder-$\beta$ smooth function that depends
only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly
smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions,
the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$
\left( \frac{1}{n}
\right)^{\frac{\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}{{\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\frac{1}{s+1})\cdot\beta\cdot(1\wedge\beta)^q}}}\;\;\;,
$$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can
achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. This result
provides theoretical justification for the excellent performance of ReLU DNNs
in practical classification tasks, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
The technique used to establish these results extends the oracle inequality
presented in our previous work. The generalized approach is of independent
interest.

Motivation: 现有条件矩限制（CMR）估计器在两阶段方法中直接插入第一阶段估计会导致第二阶段偏差，尤其是使用深度神经网络时。

Method: 基于双/去偏机器学习框架，提出DML-CMR算法，设计新的学习目标以减少偏差。

Result: DML-CMR在参数化和温和正则条件下达到最小最大最优收敛速率O(N^{-1/2})，并在实际数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DML-CMR在IV回归和近端因果学习等CMR问题上优于现有方法，展示了先进性能。

Abstract: Solving conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) is a key problem considered in
statistics, causal inference, and econometrics, where the aim is to solve for a
function of interest that satisfies some conditional moment equalities.
Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental
variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems.
Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation
is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest.
However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in
the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR
estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where
regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage
CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate
guarantees. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and develop the
DML-CMR algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML)
framework. We show that our DML-CMR estimator can achieve the minimax optimal
convergence rate of $O(N^{-1/2})$ under parameterisation and mild regularity
conditions, where $N$ is the sample size. We apply DML-CMR to a range of
problems using DNN estimators, including IV regression and proximal causal
learning on real-world datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance
against existing CMR estimators and algorithms tailored to those problems.

Motivation: 研究动机源于分析更复杂案例（如掩码高斯混合模型）以及在冷冻电子显微镜应用中遇到的挑战，旨在理解k-means算法在高维数据中的局限性。

Method: 论文采用简单的高斯混合模型（GMM）进行理论分析，探讨k-means在高维、高噪声和小样本量条件下的表现。

Result: 研究发现，在特定条件下，几乎所有数据分区都成为k-means算法的固定点，解释了k-means在高维环境中的失效原因。

Conclusion: 结论指出k-means在高维、高噪声和小样本量情况下表现不佳，为后续研究更复杂模型和应用场景提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Clustering and estimating cluster means are core problems in statistics and
machine learning, with k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) being two
widely used algorithms. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for
the failure of k-means in high-dimensional settings with high noise and limited
sample sizes, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). We identify regimes
where, with high probability, almost every partition of the data becomes a
fixed point of the k-means algorithm. This study is motivated by challenges in
the analysis of more complex cases, such as masked GMMs, and those arising from
applications in Cryo-Electron Microscopy.

Abstract: When applicants get rejected by an algorithmic decision system, recourse
explanations provide actionable suggestions for how to change their input
features to get a positive evaluation. A crucial yet overlooked phenomenon is
that recourse explanations are performative: When many applicants act according
to their recommendations, their collective behavior may change statistical
regularities in the data and, once the model is refitted, also the decision
boundary. Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own
recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of
implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In
this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse
explanations remain valid under performativity. A key finding is that recourse
actions may become invalid if they are influenced by or if they intervene on
non-causal variables. Based on our analysis, we caution against the use of
standard counterfactual explanations and causal recourse methods, and instead
advocate for recourse methods that recommend actions exclusively on causal
variables.

TL;DR: 提出一种数据驱动方法，通过学习时间依赖二元分类器来估计多元随机过程的时间依赖概率密度，适用于复杂密度重建和异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以准确估计复杂时间依赖、多模态或近退化的概率密度分布，特别是在已知初始密度的情况下。

Method: 使用基于对比估计的目标训练时间依赖二元分类器，通过判别相邻时间点的随机过程实现来建模时间依赖概率密度。

Result: 方法能准确重建复杂密度分布，适用于中等高维问题，并在异常检测中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时间依赖概率密度估计问题，扩展了在样本生成和异常检测等领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method to learn the time-dependent probability
density of a multivariate stochastic process from sample paths, assuming that
the initial probability density is known and can be evaluated. Our method uses
a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive
estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between
realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants.
Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent
probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value
of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally,
the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a
second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of
the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the
time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic
excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a
random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we
generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants.
Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the
necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit
approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through
applications in unsupervised outlier detection. Through several numerical
experiments, we show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs complex
time-dependent, multi-modal, and near-degenerate densities, scales effectively
to moderately high-dimensional problems, and reliably detects rare events among
real-world data.

Method: 提出一种基于贪心前向选择估计器的集成方法，通过特征子采样随机化选择特征，并设计动态编程实现以提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种设置下优于lasso和弹性网络。随机集成能同时减少训练误差和自由度，改变了传统认为其类似收缩的观点。在正交特征下，集成估计器通过逻辑权重重新缩放最小二乘系数，扩大了模型搜索空间。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对随机森林的理解，表明隐式正则化的效果可能比显式正则化更复杂。

Abstract: Combining randomized estimators in an ensemble, such as via random forests,
has become a fundamental technique in modern data science, but can be
computationally expensive. Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves
predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the
context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of
greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling
-- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset.
We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly
improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful
numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as
lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to
prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show
via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and
degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve
of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of
orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the
ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic
weights, thereby enlarging the model search space. These results enhance our
understanding of random forests and suggest that implicit regularization in
general may have more complicated effects than explicit regularization.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变(DR)是全球糖尿病患者的常见并发症，传统人工诊断方法耗时耗力。研究旨在开发一种基于边缘AI的实时检测方案，以解决资源匮乏地区的早期诊断难题。

Method: 使用Kaggle EyePACS数据集中的3,662张视网膜图像，通过数据增强和归一化预处理，训练并优化MobileNet、ShuffleNet、SqueezeNet等CNN模型及自定义DNN。模型转为TensorFlowLite格式并进行8位整数量化以减少体积。

Conclusion: 该边缘AI方案为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、低成本的解决方案，特别适用于资源受限的偏远医疗场景，实现了及时准确的诊断。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: FAHR-Face模型通过4000万张面部图像训练，在生物年龄估计和生存风险预测任务中表现优异，具有临床潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种非侵入性方法，通过面部外观评估健康状况，特别是生物年龄和癌症患者的生存风险。

Method: FAHR-Face基础模型经过两阶段微调：FAHR-FaceAge用于年龄估计，FAHR-FaceSurvival用于生存预测，并在多个数据集上测试了鲁棒性和独立性。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在公开数据集上年龄估计误差最低（5.1年），FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率，高风险组死亡率是最低组的三倍以上。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，有效捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险，提升预后准确性。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于DICOM头部信息常因协议多样性和技术员错误而不准确，影响了放射科医生的工作效率，因此需要一种自动分类mpMRI序列的方法。

Method: 采用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet等多种深度学习模型对mpMRI数据进行训练和比较，最终选择性能最佳的DenseNet-121模型，并研究其在不同训练数据量和不同扫描仪数据下的表现。

Result: DenseNet-121模型在内部数据集上达到0.972的准确率和0.966的F1分数，在外部数据集DLDS和CPTAC-UCEC上分别达到0.872和0.810的准确率。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型能够高效分类mpMRI序列，且随着训练数据量的增加，性能进一步提升，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了Transformer模型（UNETR和SwinUNETR）在T2加权MRI图像前列腺分割中的性能，发现SwinUNETR在多种训练策略下表现优于传统3D UNet，尤其在处理标签噪声和类别不平衡时更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决前列腺MRI分割中因读者间差异和跨站点域偏移导致的自动分割精度下降问题，探索Transformer模型在此类异质性数据中的表现。

Method: 研究比较了UNETR和SwinUNETR与基线3D UNet的性能，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证混合队列、基于腺体大小的数据集），并通过Optuna优化超参数，最终以独立读者群体的测试集评估（Dice相似系数）。

Result: SwinUNETR在单读者训练中平均Dice得分为0.816（Reader#1）和0.860（Reader#2），在交叉验证混合训练中分别为0.8583和0.867，在基于腺体大小的数据集中达到0.902和0.894，显著优于UNETR和传统3D UNet。

Conclusion: 研究表明，SwinUNETR的全局和移位窗口自注意力机制能有效降低标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，Dice分数比CNN提升高达5分，同时保持计算效率，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Motivation: 当前可解释AI评估过于侧重技术保真度，忽视了认知可访问性，尤其对视障用户影响显著。需建立连接解释属性与认知过程的模型。

Method: 提出CUE认知模型（可读性、可理解性、可解释性三阶段），通过455人实验测试不同热力图配色方案（BWR/Cividis/Coolwarm）对用户的影响。

Result: 发现视障用户任务完成率相当但信心/努力度更低，且专为无障碍设计的Cividis配色反而可能加剧差距，验证了解释可读性对理解的影响。

Conclusion: 挑战了感知优化的传统假设，证明需要自适应XAI界面，验证CUE模型有效性，推动以用户为中心的可解释AI设计。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly inform critical decisions, the need
for human-understandable explanations grows. Current evaluations of Explainable
AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which
critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We
propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking
explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception),
readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study
(N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we
found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually
impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes
worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results
challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for
adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering
explanation legibility affects understandability. We contribute: (1) a
formalized cognitive model for explanation understanding, (2) an integrated
definition of human-centered explanation properties, and (3) empirical evidence
motivating accessible, user-tailored XAI.

Abstract: This article introduces WebXAII, an open-source web framework designed to
facilitate research on human interaction with eXplainable Artificial

the growing societal implications of the widespread adoption of AI (and in

the interaction between humans and XAI techniques typically develop ad hoc

the reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement
WebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,
meaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants
and record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a
composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of
flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so
that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We
demonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by
reproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature. The
framework is available at https://github.com/PAJEAN/WebXAII.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了AI生成的角色代表性数据对公众的有用性和可信度，并开发了一个基于CLIP模型的可视化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去的研究主要关注通过机器学习模型量化媒体内容中的角色代表性，但缺乏对公众对这些数据有用性和可信度的了解。

Method: 使用基于CLIP模型的工具分析视觉数据，量化年龄和性别维度的角色代表性，并设计适合普通观众的可视化方案。通过用户研究评估工具的有用性和可信度。

Result: 参与者认为工具总体上有用，但希望包含更多人口统计类别和角色上下文信息。对AI生成的性别和年龄数据的信任度中等偏低。

Conclusion: 尽管公众对AI生成的角色代表性数据信任度不高，但并不反对在此背景下使用AI。未来需要更详细的可视化和更多上下文信息。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI has enabled automated analysis of complex media content
at scale and generate actionable insights regarding character representation
along such dimensions as gender and age. Past work focused on quantifying
representation from audio/video/text using various ML models, but without
having the audience in the loop. We ask, even if character distribution along
demographic dimensions are available, how useful are they to the general
public? Do they actually trust the numbers generated by AI models? Our work
addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based
character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the
Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze
visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of
age and gender. We also designed effective visualizations suitable for
presenting such analytics to lay audience. Next, we conducted a user study to
seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the
AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our
visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics
from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also
indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic
categories and contextual information of the characters. Participants' trust in
AI-based gender and age models is seen to be moderate to low, although they
were not against the use of AI in this context. Our tool including code,
benchmarking, and data from the user study can be found here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI4SI项目日益受到关注，但其在实现实际社会影响方面仍面临诸多挑战，如合作者参与度低、项目难以规模化等。本文旨在揭示这些挑战并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过对六位领先AI4SI研究者的半结构化访谈，结合作者自身经验，进行主题分析，识别部署AI4SI解决方案的关键障碍。

Result: 研究发现，结构性和组织性、沟通、协作及操作层面的挑战是阻碍AI4SI项目落地的主要因素。研究还提出了基于访谈和实践的最佳策略。

Conclusion: 本文为AI4SI研究者和合作组织提供了实用参考指南，帮助更有效地参与具有社会影响力的AI合作，尽管这些挑战没有简单的解决方案。

Abstract: In an attempt to tackle the UN SDGs, AI for Social Impact (AI4SI) projects
focus on harnessing AI to address societal issues in areas such as healthcare,
social justice, etc. Unfortunately, despite growing interest in AI4SI,
achieving tangible, on-the-ground impact remains a significant challenge. For
example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to
co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often
difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects
"fail" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to
transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique
challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within
the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily
applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized
in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse
challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that
prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground.
Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers -
complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research
- this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in
developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic
analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication,
collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While
there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies
drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space. In doing so, we
hope this paper serves as a practical reference guide for AI4SI researchers and
partner organizations seeking to engage more effectively in socially impactful
AI collaborations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合DALL-E 3与材料数据库的新流程，为AI生成的内饰设计添加可持续性指标和材料使用数据，帮助设计师评估环境影响并优化设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI（如文本到图像模型）虽能快速生成视觉效果，但缺乏对设计师有用的可操作数据，特别是在可持续性和材料选择方面。

Method: 通过后处理模块识别AI生成设计中的前10种材料，并与材料字典中的二氧化碳当量（CO2e）值匹配，提供可持续性指标。通过三种用户测试评估系统效果。

Result: 测试表明，引入可持续性指标（尤其是定量CO2e数据）能引导更环保的设计决策，但也可能导致决策疲劳和满意度下降。多数参与者在第三种测试中将可持续性原则纳入工作流程。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在AI辅助建筑设计中平衡设计自由与实用约束的重要性，为数据驱动的生态友好设计提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Generative AI, specifically text-to-image models, have revolutionized
interior architectural design by enabling the rapid translation of conceptual
ideas into visual representations from simple text prompts. While generative AI
can produce visually appealing images they often lack actionable data for
designers In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates DALL-E 3
with a materials dataset to enrich AI-generated designs with sustainability
metrics and material usage insights. After the model generates an interior
design image, a post-processing module identifies the top ten materials present
and pairs them with carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) values from a general
materials dictionary. This approach allows designers to immediately evaluate
environmental impacts and refine prompts accordingly. We evaluate the system
through three user tests: (1) no mention of sustainability to the user prior to
the prompting process with generative AI, (2) sustainability goals communicated
to the user before prompting, and (3) sustainability goals communicated along
with quantitative CO2e data included in the generative AI outputs. Our
qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of
sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design
decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall
satisfaction. Nevertheless, the majority of participants reported incorporating
sustainability principles into their workflows in the third test, underscoring
the potential of integrated metrics to guide more ecologically responsible
practices. Our findings showcase the importance of balancing design freedom
with practical constraints, offering a clear path toward holistic, data-driven
solutions in AI-assisted architectural design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AD/ADRD家庭照护者面临巨大心理压力，但生成式AI（如LLMs）在此领域的应用认知不足。研究旨在填补这一空白，探索AI如何有效支持照护者需求。

Method: 开发基于GPT-4o的聊天机器人Carey作为技术探针，通过16名照护者的场景化半结构化访谈，采用归纳编码和反思性主题分析法提炼需求。

Result: 识别出照护者六大核心需求（如即时信息获取、情感支持等）及矛盾点，提出AI聊天机器人的优势、差距及以照护者为中心的设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究为设计可信赖、主动式的AI心理健康支持系统提供理论与实践依据，以动态满足AD/ADRD照护者需求。

Abstract: Family caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (AD/ADRD) face significant emotional and logistical challenges that
place them at heightened risk for stress, anxiety, and depression. Although
recent advances in generative AI -- particularly large language models (LLMs)
-- offer new opportunities to support mental health, little is known about how
caregivers perceive and engage with such technologies. To address this gap, we
developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and
emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following
scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through
inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic
understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes --
on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure,
crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes,
we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and
concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths,
gaps, and design recommendations. Our findings offer theoretical and practical
insights to inform the design of proactive, trustworthy, and caregiver-centered
AI systems that better support the evolving mental health needs of AD/ADRD
caregivers.

Abstract: Surveys are a cornerstone of Information Systems (IS) research, yet creating
high-quality surveys remains labor-intensive, requiring both domain expertise
and methodological rigor. With the evolution of large language models (LLMs),
new opportunities emerge to automate survey generation. This paper presents the
real-world deployment of an LLM-powered system designed to accelerate data
collection while maintaining survey quality. Deploying such systems in
production introduces real-world complexity, including diverse user needs and
quality control. We evaluate the system using the DeLone and McLean IS Success
Model to understand how generative AI can reshape a core IS method. This study
makes three key contributions. To our knowledge, this is the first application
of the IS Success Model to a generative AI system for survey creation. In
addition, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining automated and
human assessments. Finally, we implement safeguards that mitigate
post-deployment risks and support responsible integration into IS workflows.

DR-based visual analytics reliable. However, the diversity and extensiveness of
the literature can leave novice analysts and researchers uncertain about where
to begin and proceed. To address this problem, we propose a guide for reading
papers for reliable visual analytics with DR. Relying on the previous
classification of the relevant literature, our guide helps both practitioners
to (1) assess their current DR expertise and (2) identify papers that will
further enhance their understanding. Interview studies with three experts in DR
and data visualizations validate the significance, comprehensiveness, and
usefulness of our guide.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的人机协同学习范式，通过Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏实验证明，人类与AI能通过动态整合感知信息共同构建符号系统，实现双向学习而非单向知识传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI教学依赖单向知识传递，难以整合不同模态的信息。本文旨在探索人类与AI如何通过双向互动整合局部感知信息，共同构建外部表征（符号涌现），推动共生AI系统的发展。

Method: 采用基于Metropolis-Hastings命名游戏（MHNG）的分散式贝叶斯推理机制，设计在线联合注意力命名游戏实验（JA-NG），69名参与者与三种AI代理（MH基础型、全接受型、全拒绝型）在局部可观测条件下互动。

Result: 实验表明：1) 人类与MH基础型AI配对显著提高了分类准确性；2) 双方能更强地收敛至共享符号系统；3) 人类接受行为与MH推导的接受概率高度吻合。

Conclusion: 研究首次实证了基于MHNG的人机协同学习能实现感知经验动态对齐，为开发'与人类共同学习'的共生AI系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: We propose co-creative learning as a novel paradigm where humans and AI,
i.e., biological and artificial agents, mutually integrate their partial
perceptual information and knowledge to construct shared external
representations, a process we interpret as symbol emergence. Unlike traditional
AI teaching based on unilateral knowledge transfer, this addresses the
challenge of integrating information from inherently different modalities. We
empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference
mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention
naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,
always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that
human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization
accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared
sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the
MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical
evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based
interaction. This suggests a promising path toward symbiotic AI systems that
learn with humans, rather than from them, by dynamically aligning perceptual
experiences, opening a new venue for symbiotic AI alignment.

Motivation: 研究动机在于开发一个能够准确学习分数阶非线性系统动态特性的框架，特别是针对分数阶、漂移向量场和控制向量场的估计，以克服整数阶模型在描述长程依赖性时的局限性。

Method: 方法包括两个主要步骤：首先设计输入输出实验生成必要数据集；其次利用这些数据集和分数阶系统的记忆依赖性，估计系统分数阶，并通过正交基函数重构漂移和控制向量场。

Result: 通过对四个基准分数阶系统的验证，结果表明所提框架能准确学习系统动态。数值比较显示分数阶模型在捕捉长程依赖性上优于整数阶模型。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的数据集成框架有效学习了分数阶非线性系统的动态特性，分数阶模型在描述长程依赖性方面具有明显优势，凸显了整数阶模型的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-integrated framework for learning the dynamics of
fractional-order nonlinear systems in both discrete-time and continuous-time
settings. The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step,
input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for
learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector
field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along
with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to
estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are
then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed
approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems.
The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the
system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn
equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that
fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting
the limitations of integer-order representations.

Motivation: 现有方法通常假设IMU传感器紧密附着于人体，但实际应用中这一假设常不成立，因此需要研究松散附着IMU的全身姿态估计。

Method: 利用现有服装感知运动数据集模拟IMU数据，开发基于Transformer的扩散模型处理松散IMU数据并估计姿态，同时结合服装参数增强模型表达能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU传感器的全身姿态估计开辟了新方向，未来研究前景广阔。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成提供了一种高效强化学习对齐方案，显著提升生成质量与可控性。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

TL;DR: 通过梯度优化提示调优，研究展示了间接数据投毒可有效保护数据集并追踪其使用，且不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型预训练依赖多样且难以筛选的文本数据，现有数据追踪方法依赖训练数据记忆，而模型提供者试图限制这种记忆。本研究旨在探索不依赖记忆的间接数据投毒方法。

Method: 采用基于梯度的优化提示调优技术，使模型学习训练数据中不存在的秘密提示与回应序列。

Result: 实验证明，仅需少于0.005%的投毒标记即可让模型学习秘密序列，并以极高置信度检测使用情况（p < 10^-55），且不影响基准测试表现。

Conclusion: 间接数据投毒是一种可行且高效的数据保护与追踪方法，无需依赖训练数据记忆，且保持模型性能不变。

Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text
datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although
membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace
data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM
providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data
poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not
only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its
use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn
arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent
from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models
pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are
sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely
high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.
Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and
despite secrets never appearing in the training set.

*Ben Jacobsen,Kassem Fawaz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的差分隐私连续计数算法，适用于输入规模未知的场景，通过引入基于对数扰动的矩阵分解方法，实现了平滑误差和高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于矩阵机制的最优算法在输入规模未知时无法直接应用，且常见的'倍增技巧'会导致次优和非平滑误差。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入基于对数扰动的矩阵分解方法，特别是对函数1/√(1-z)进行对数扰动，从而设计出适用于未知输入规模的算法。

Result: 算法在任意α>0和t≤n时，能以O(log²⁺²α(t))的方差私有估计前t个数据点的和，空间复杂度O(t)，每轮摊销时间O(log t)。

Conclusion: 新算法在未知输入规模下实现了平滑误差和高效性能，其实际表现与已知最优算法相当，方差在t高达2²⁴时仍小于1.5倍。

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the
unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current
state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix
mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only
hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick'
avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve
this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic
perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works,
which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error,
and for any $\alpha > 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum
of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It
requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to
$O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing
time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA
2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable
to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for
$t$ as large as $2^{24}$.

Conclusion: 确保AI/ML医疗设备安全需从设计阶段入手，提出的工具有助于提升设备安全性。

Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming
healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this
advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of
complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability
with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities
in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack
surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging.
Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on
these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant
safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices
from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of
addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the
pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device
recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat
landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient
safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques
designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive
premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed
cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices,
thereby making them safe for patients.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于卷积自编码器（CAE）的方法，用于检测5G-NR网络中的空中干扰攻击，并通过生成对抗网络（CWGAN-GP）平衡数据集，最终在干扰信号检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G-NR无线蜂窝网络中，空中干扰攻击普遍存在，严重影响接收信号质量。因此，研究一种有效的干扰检测方法具有重要意义。

Method: 论文通过向真实世界的I/Q OFDM数据集中添加高斯白噪声（AWGN）模拟干扰环境，利用卷积自编码器（CAE）进行干扰检测，并使用CWGAN-GP平衡数据集。

Result: CAE模型在干扰信号检测中表现出色，平均精确度为97.33%，召回率为91.33%，F1分数为94.08%，准确率为94.35%，优于其他基准模型。

Conclusion: 尽管数据集存在复杂性和异构性，CAE模型在干扰检测中展现出强大的鲁棒性，为5G-NR网络的安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks,
over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising
the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by
incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase
and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is
exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as
heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization
Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance.
Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by
employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB
observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of
the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models:
Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder
(CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all
datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal
by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08%
F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: deepSURF结合静态分析与LLM引导的模糊测试，有效识别Rust库中的内存安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在检测Rust内存漏洞时能力有限，无法充分处理Rust特有类型或依赖过多人工干预。

Method: deepSURF通过替换泛型为自定义类型并生成特质实现，结合LLM动态增强模糊测试用例，探索复杂API交互。

Result: 在27个Rust库中重新发现20个已知漏洞和6个新漏洞，表现优于现有工具。

Conclusion: deepSURF显著提升了Rust内存漏洞的检测能力，为不安全代码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of
unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused.
Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically
exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific
types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates
static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness
generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust
libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel
approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and
generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the
fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library.
Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically,
facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly
increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We
evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20
known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SimBank，一个用于准确基准测试PresPM方法的模拟器，解决了当前文献中技术比较不足和评估方法不充分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PresPM领域缺乏对不同技术的广泛比较和有效的评估方法，SimBank旨在填补这些空白。

Method: SimBank模拟银行的贷款申请流程，支持在线和离线PresPM方法的比较，包含多种干预优化问题和因果机器学习挑战。

Result: SimBank能够为每个测试案例生成每种干预下的真实结果，并通过概念验证展示了其基准测试能力。

Conclusion: SimBank作为一个公开可用的模拟器，对推动PresPM的研究和实践具有重要价值。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is an emerging area within Process
Mining, focused on optimizing processes through real-time interventions for
effective decision-making. PresPM holds significant promise for organizations
seeking enhanced operational performance. However, the current literature faces
two key limitations: a lack of extensive comparisons between techniques and
insufficient evaluation approaches. To address these gaps, we introduce
SimBank: a simulator designed for accurate benchmarking of PresPM methods.
Modeled after a bank's loan application process, SimBank enables extensive
comparisons of both online and offline PresPM methods. It incorporates a
variety of intervention optimization problems with differing levels of
complexity and supports experiments on key causal machine learning challenges,
such as assessing a method's robustness to confounding in data. SimBank
additionally offers a comprehensive evaluation capability: for each test case,
it can generate the true outcome under each intervention action, which is not
possible using recorded datasets. The simulator incorporates parallel
activities and loops, drawing from common logs to generate cases that closely
resemble real-life process instances. Our proof of concept demonstrates
SimBank's benchmarking capabilities through experiments with various PresPM
methods across different interventions, highlighting its value as a publicly
available simulator for advancing research and practice in PresPM.

TL;DR: DisProtEdit是一个可控的蛋白质编辑框架，通过双通道自然语言监督学习解耦的结构和功能表示，提高了可解释性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖联合整体嵌入，缺乏对结构和功能属性的解耦表示，限制了蛋白质编辑的模块化和可解释性。

Method: 构建多模态数据集SwissProtDis，利用大语言模型自动分解结构和功能描述，通过对齐和解耦损失学习解耦表示，支持文本驱动的蛋白质编辑。

Result: 在蛋白质编辑和表示学习基准测试中表现优异，多属性编辑的成功率达到61.7%，展示了同时编辑结构和功能的有效性。

Conclusion: DisProtEdit通过解耦表示和自然语言监督，实现了更可控和可解释的蛋白质编辑，为蛋白质工程提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce DisProtEdit, a controllable protein editing framework that
leverages dual-channel natural language supervision to learn disentangled
representations of structural and functional properties. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly
separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To
support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where
each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for
structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language
model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and
uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence
between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing
is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated
latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation
learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with
existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.
On a newly constructed multi-attribute editing benchmark, the model achieves a
both-hit success rate of up to 61.7%, highlighting its effectiveness in
coordinating simultaneous structural and functional edits.

Conclusion: POCO为跨会话神经预测提供了可扩展的解决方案，为未来神经基础模型和自适应神经技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Predicting future neural activity is a core challenge in modeling brain
dynamics, with applications ranging from scientific investigation to
closed-loop neurotechnology. While recent models of population activity
emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural
forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains
underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a
lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture
both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium
imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.
After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal
fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically
meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical
labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing
performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing.
Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for
cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model
design. By enabling accurate, generalizable forecasting models of neural
dynamics across individuals and species, POCO lays the groundwork for adaptive
neurotechnologies and large-scale efforts for neural foundation models.

Motivation: 在大规模工业无线网络中，确保包级通信质量对于超可靠低延迟通信(URLLC)至关重要。现有的LDP算法采用静态优先级分配，无法适应实时网络变化。

Method: 结合卷积神经网络(CNN)和图着色技术，根据实时流量、传输机会和网络条件动态分配链路优先级，离线训练阶段降低了额外开销。

Result: 仿真结果显示，在三种网络配置下，SINR分别比LDP提升了113%、94%和49%，显著提高了网络容量和可调度性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂URLLC场景，实现了更高效的资源分配和干扰协调。

We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a
CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference
coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static

Motivation: 在大规模工业无线网络中，确保包级通信质量对超可靠低延迟通信(URLLC)至关重要。传统LDP算法的静态优先级无法适应动态网络环境，因此需要一种能实时学习并调整链路优先级的方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，对经济叙事的兴趣增加，但现有自然语言处理技术缺乏深层语义理解，难以区分经济叙事提取与传统语义角色标注任务。

Method: 通过分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，应用严格的叙事定义，并比较GPT-4输出与专家标注的黄金标准叙事。

Result: GPT-4能够以结构化格式提取有效的经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在经济研究中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以应对复杂任务，并为未来经济和社会科学研究提供指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

Motivation: 渡轮码头因暴露于恶劣海洋环境和渡轮冲击而快速劣化，振动结构健康监测是评估结构完整性的重要方法。但由于传感器布置限制，虚拟传感技术成为建立数字孪生和估计结构响应的关键。

Method: 研究采用高斯过程潜在力模型（GPLFM）结合实验数据和基于物理的降阶结构模型，通过模态贡献表示未知冲击力，并探讨了传感器布置策略和参数敏感性。

Result: GPLFM在大多数位置提供了准确的加速度响应估计，但在冲击区域精度较低。数值研究表明，合理的传感器布置和参数选择可提高估计准确性。

Conclusion: GPLFM能有效处理建模和测量不确定性，在多种场景下保持可接受的估计精度，为渡轮码头的数字孪生开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Ferry quays experience rapid deterioration due to their exposure to harsh
maritime environments and ferry impacts. Vibration-based structural health
monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and
understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical
limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations.
Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a
Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates
the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual
sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data
collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The
proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order
structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact
forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for
the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact
characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary
conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM
provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under
simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during
the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone.
A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor
placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types,
sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios. The results
suggest that the GP latent forces can help accommodate modeling and measurement
uncertainties, maintaining acceptable estimation accuracy across scenarios.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) continue to evolve, their
cognitive and reasoning capabilities have seen remarkable progress. However,
challenges in visual fine-grained perception and commonsense causal inference
persist. This paper introduces Argus Inspection, a multimodal benchmark with

can interpret both visual data and human language queries. This work introduces
ViLLa (Vision-Language-Logic Approach), a neuro-symbolic framework designed for
interpretable animal monitoring. ViLLa integrates three core components: a
visual detection module for identifying animals and their spatial locations in
images, a language parser for understanding natural language queries, and a
symbolic reasoning layer that applies logic-based inference to answer those
queries. Given an image and a question such as "How many dogs are in the
scene?" or "Where is the buffalo?", the system grounds visual detections into
symbolic facts and uses predefined rules to compute accurate answers related to
count, presence, and location. Unlike end-to-end black-box models, ViLLa
separates perception, understanding, and reasoning, offering modularity and
transparency. The system was evaluated on a range of animal imagery tasks and
demonstrates the ability to bridge visual content with structured,
human-interpretable queries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GraphGSOcc模型，通过双高斯图注意力机制改进3D语义占据预测，解决现有方法中特征聚合和边界模糊问题，在性能和内存效率上均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法存在两个关键问题：1）统一特征聚合忽略了相似类别和区域间的语义相关性；2）MLP迭代优化缺乏几何约束导致边界模糊。

Method: 提出GraphGSOcc框架，结合语义和几何图Transformer。核心是双高斯图注意力机制：几何图根据高斯位姿自适应计算KNN搜索半径，语义图通过余弦相似度保留高相关节点。配合多尺度图注意力框架，分层优化边界细节和对象级拓扑。

Result: 在SurroundOcc数据集上达到24.10% mIoU，GPU内存降至6.1GB。相比GaussianWorld提升1.97% mIoU并减少13.7%内存。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模几何和语义关系，GraphGSOcc在3D语义占据预测任务中实现了精度和效率的平衡，为自动驾驶感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous
driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splating (3DGS)
methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among
similar categories and across regions, and (2) boundary ambiguities caused by
the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization. We propose the
GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph
Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the
Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph
structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on
Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from
broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric
consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via
cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across
instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained
attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained
attention at higher layers models object-level topology. Experiments on the
SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 24.10%, reducing GPU memory to 6.1 GB,
demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to
GaussianWorld

Motivation: 随着AI生成视频在媒体平台上的普及，可靠区分合成内容与真实视频变得紧迫且必要。现有方法仅将其视为二分类任务，缺乏对检测原因的解释，难以说服审计者和终端用户。

Method: 引入DAVID-X数据集（含AI生成视频的时空缺陷标注和书面解释），并基于此开发DAVID-XR1视频-语言模型，提供缺陷分类、时空定位和自然语言解释的透明推理链。

Conclusion: 该研究将AI生成视频检测从黑箱决策转变为透明诊断过程，为可信内容识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: As AI-generated video becomes increasingly pervasive across media platforms,
the ability to reliably distinguish synthetic content from authentic footage
has become both urgent and essential. Existing approaches have primarily
treated this challenge as a binary classification task, offering limited
insight into where or why a model identifies a video as AI-generated. However,
the core challenge extends beyond simply detecting subtle artifacts; it
requires providing fine-grained, persuasive evidence that can convince auditors
and end-users alike. To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the
first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,
temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich
annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver
an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,
temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach
fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box
decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate
that a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced
with chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a
variety of generators and generation modes. Our results highlight the promise
of explainable detection methods for trustworthy identification of AI-generated
video content.

Finally, our architecture is scalable, inexpensive, and compliant with stricter

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ChartIR方法，通过结构化指令和迭代优化提升多模态大模型在图表转代码任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在图表转代码任务中表现不佳，需要同时具备精确的视觉理解和代码转换能力。直接提示模型效果不理想，因此需要新的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉理解和代码翻译两部分，设计描述和差异两种结构化指令，并采用初始代码生成和迭代优化的两阶段流程。

Result: 在开源模型Qwen2-VL和闭源模型GPT-4o上均取得了优于其他方法的表现。

Conclusion: ChartIR方法通过结构化指令和迭代优化有效提升了多模态大模型在图表转代码任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing
research attention due to their powerful visual understanding capabilities.
While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their
performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires
MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding
not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual
elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex
task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose
{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.
First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To
accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of
structured instructions: description and difference. The description
instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the
difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference
chart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual
features into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent
code translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation
pipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,
enabling progressive enhancement of the final output. Experimental results show
that, compared to other method, our method achieves superior performance on
both the open-source model Qwen2-VL and the closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域构建图像分类模型面临挑战，现有ICL方法忽视了图像嵌入模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出PictSure框架，系统研究不同视觉编码器、预训练目标和微调策略对少样本分类的影响。

Result: PictSure在域外基准测试中超越现有ICL方法，同时在域内任务保持相当性能。

Conclusion: 嵌入模型的预训练方式对少样本分类性能具有决定性影响，PictSure为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building image classification models remains cumbersome in data-scarce
domains, where collecting large labeled datasets is impractical. In-context
learning (ICL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for few-shot image
classification (FSIC), enabling models to generalize across domains without
gradient-based adaptation. However, prior work has largely overlooked a
critical component of ICL-based FSIC pipelines: the role of image embeddings.
In this work, we present PictSure, an ICL framework that places the embedding
model -- its architecture, pretraining, and training dynamics -- at the center
of analysis. We systematically examine the effects of different visual encoder
types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies on downstream FSIC
performance. Our experiments show that the training success and the
out-of-domain performance are highly dependent on how the embedding models are
pretrained. Consequently, PictSure manages to outperform existing ICL-based
FSIC models on out-of-domain benchmarks that differ significantly from the
training distribution, while maintaining comparable results on in-domain tasks.

*Shreyas Rajeev,B Sathish Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为BKSEF的框架，用于在卷积神经网络中优化每层的核大小选择，通过平衡信息增益、计算效率和准确性提升，实现了显著的性能改进和计算成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络中的核大小选择是一个关键但常被忽视的设计决策，它影响感受野、特征提取、计算成本和模型准确性。传统方法通常使用固定的3x3核，缺乏理论依据和优化。

Method: 论文提出了最佳核大小估计函数（BKSEF），这是一个基于数学理论和实证验证的框架，结合了信息论、信号处理和学习理论的原理，用于逐层确定最优核大小。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，BKSEF引导的架构相比传统使用统一3x3核的模型，实现了最高3.1%的准确性提升和42.8%的FLOPs减少。两个实际案例进一步验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: BKSEF证明了核大小可以作为一个可优化的参数，而不仅仅是固定的启发式选择。它为研究人员和开发者提供了实用的启发式方法和理论支持，适用于神经架构搜索管道和实时系统。

Abstract: Kernel size selection in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a critical
but often overlooked design decision that affects receptive field, feature
extraction, computational cost, and model accuracy. This paper proposes the
Best Kernel Size Estimation Function (BKSEF), a mathematically grounded and
empirically validated framework for optimal, layer-wise kernel size
determination. BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and
accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal
processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided
architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent
reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels.
Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical
image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign
recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and
accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with
minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an
active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic. BKSEF provides
practical heuristics and theoretical support for researchers and developers
seeking efficient and application-aware CNN designs. It is suitable for
integration into neural architecture search pipelines and real-time systems,
offering a new perspective on CNN optimization.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的零售视频自动标注方法，通过关键帧识别和对象检测技术提升效率，节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零售视频标注依赖人工，效率低且成本高，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 利用深度神经网络学习视频帧特征，结合零售场景优化的对象检测技术实现自动标注。

Result: 方法准确率媲美人工标注，节省50%成本，仅需人工校验不足5%的帧。

Conclusion: 该自动化方案显著降低零售视频标注成本，适用于顾客行为分析等多样化场景。

Abstract: Accurate video annotation plays a vital role in modern retail applications,
including customer behavior analysis, product interaction detection, and
in-store activity recognition. However, conventional annotation methods heavily
rely on time-consuming manual labeling by human annotators, introducing
non-robust frame selection and increasing operational costs. To address these
challenges in the retail domain, we propose a deep learning-based approach that
automates key-frame identification in retail videos and provides automatic
annotations of products and customers. Our method leverages deep neural
networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and
incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail
environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach
over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator
labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation.
Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video
annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of
detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process
for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can
significantly reduce operational costs. The automation of key-frame detection
enables substantial time and effort savings in retail video labeling tasks,
proving highly valuable for diverse retail applications such as shopper journey
analysis, product interaction detection, and in-store security monitoring.

Abstract: Aiming at the problem of difficulty in accurately identifying graphical
implicit correlations in multimodal irony detection tasks, this paper proposes
a Semantic Irony Recognition Network (SemIRNet). The model contains three main
innovations: (1) The ConceptNet knowledge base is introduced for the first time
to acquire conceptual knowledge, which enhances the model's common-sense
reasoning ability; (2) Two cross-modal semantic similarity detection modules at
the word level and sample level are designed to model graphic-textual
correlations at different granularities; and (3) A contrastive learning loss
function is introduced to optimize the spatial distribution of the sample
features, which improves the separability of positive and negative samples.
Experiments on a publicly available multimodal irony detection benchmark
dataset show that the accuracy and F1 value of this model are improved by 1.64%
and 2.88% to 88.87% and 86.33%, respectively, compared with the existing
optimal methods. Further ablation experiments verify the important role of
knowledge fusion and semantic similarity detection in improving the model
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D物体重建中，如何选择最具信息量的视角以提升重建精度和效率是一个核心挑战。传统方法依赖计算密集型的不确定性评估，而本文旨在通过轻量级神经网络直接预测不确定性，从而优化视角选择过程。

Method: 提出UPNet，一个轻量级前馈神经网络，输入单张物体图像即可预测所有候选视角的不确定性分布。通过聚合历史预测抑制冗余视角，选择信息量最大的新视角，并用于训练3D神经渲染模型。

Result: 仅需一半视角即可达到与基准方法相当的精度，计算开销降低400倍，CPU、RAM和GPU资源占用减少50%以上，且无需额外训练即可泛化至新物体类别。

Conclusion: UPNet通过神经不确定性映射实现了高效、低成本的主动视角选择，为3D重建提供了可扩展的解决方案，同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an
AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for
accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)
for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The
aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D
reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each
candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural
uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,
named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a
predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible
candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many
natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to
learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the
underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all
previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate
viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these
selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the
quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.
Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our
method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it
significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400
times speedup along with over 50\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage
compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to
AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional
training.

Conclusion: PeRL方法在多图像位置推理任务中表现出色，实现了最先进的性能，同时不影响单图像任务的性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive reasoning capabilities demonstrated by
reinforcement learning approaches like DeepSeek-R1, recent emerging research
has begun exploring the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
vision-language models (VLMs) for multimodal reasoning tasks. However, most
existing multimodal reinforcement learning approaches remain limited to spatial
reasoning within single-image contexts, yet still struggle to generalize to
more complex and real-world scenarios involving multi-image positional
reasoning, where understanding the relationships across images is crucial. To
address this challenge, we propose a general reinforcement learning approach
PeRL tailored for interleaved multimodal tasks, and a multi-stage strategy
designed to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off, thereby improving
learning efficiency and task performance. Specifically, we introduce
permutation of image sequences to simulate varied positional relationships to
explore more spatial and positional diversity. Furthermore, we design a rollout
filtering mechanism for resampling to focus on trajectories that contribute
most to learning optimal behaviors to exploit learned policies effectively. We
evaluate our model on 5 widely-used multi-image benchmarks and 3 single-image
benchmarks. Our experiments confirm that PeRL trained model consistently
surpasses R1-related and interleaved VLM baselines by a large margin, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multi-image benchmarks, while preserving
comparable performance on single-image tasks.

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar

Abstract: In the semiconductor sector, due to high demand but also strong and
increasing competition, time to market and quality are key factors in securing
significant market share in various application areas. Thanks to the success of
deep learning methods in recent years in the computer vision domain, Industry
4.0 and 5.0 applications, such as defect classification, have achieved
remarkable success. In particular, Domain Adaptation (DA) has proven highly
effective since it focuses on using the knowledge learned on a (source) domain
to adapt and perform effectively on a different but related (target) domain. By
improving robustness and scalability, DA minimizes the need for extensive
manual re-labeling or re-training of models. This not only reduces
computational and resource costs but also allows human experts to focus on
high-value tasks. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of DA techniques in
semi-supervised and unsupervised settings within the context of the

Abstract: In autonomous driving, high-definition (HD) maps and semantic maps in
bird's-eye view (BEV) are essential for accurate localization, planning, and
decision-making. This paper introduces an enhanced End-to-End model named MapFM
for online vectorized HD map generation. We show significantly boost feature
representation quality by incorporating powerful foundation model for encoding
camera images. To further enrich the model's understanding of the environment
and improve prediction quality, we integrate auxiliary prediction heads for
semantic segmentation in the BEV representation. This multi-task learning
approach provides richer contextual supervision, leading to a more
comprehensive scene representation and ultimately resulting in higher accuracy
and improved quality of the predicted vectorized HD maps. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出视频开放世界物体计数新任务，开发CountVid模型解决遮挡和相似物体干扰问题，并创建VideoCount数据集验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数方法难以处理视频中因遮挡和相似物体导致的重复计数问题，需开发能跨帧追踪并准确统计目标物体数量的新方法。

Method: 结合基于图像的计数模型与可提示视频分割追踪模型CountVid，通过跨帧关联实现开放世界物体计数。

Result: 在TAO/MOT20及企鹅/X射线结晶视频构建的VideoCount数据集上，CountVid显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CountVid为动态场景物体计数提供有效解决方案，代码及数据集已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a new task of open-world object counting in videos: given a text
description, or an image example, that specifies the target object, the
objective is to enumerate all the unique instances of the target objects in the
video. This task is especially challenging in crowded scenes with occlusions
and similar objects, where avoiding double counting and identifying
reappearances is crucial. To this end, we make the following contributions: we
introduce a model, CountVid, for this task. It leverages an image-based
counting model, and a promptable video segmentation and tracking model to
enable automated, open-world object counting across video frames. To evaluate
its performance, we introduce VideoCount, a new dataset for our novel task
built from the TAO and MOT20 tracking datasets, as well as from videos of
penguins and metal alloy crystallization captured by x-rays. Using this
dataset, we demonstrate that CountVid provides accurate object counts, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines. The VideoCount dataset, the
CountVid model, and all the code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenHOI是一个两阶段框架，旨在通过3D HOI数据集生成未见物体的高保真4D人-物交互序列，减少对大规模4D HOI数据集的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型和大规模运动数据集推动了文本驱动的人体运动合成，但由于缺乏大规模4D人-物交互数据集，将其扩展到4D HOI仍具挑战性。

Method: GenHOI采用两阶段方法：1) 使用Object-AnchorNet从3D HOI数据集中学习，为未见物体重建稀疏3D HOI关键帧；2) 引入Contact-Aware扩散模型（ContactDM）将稀疏关键帧插值为密集的4D HOI序列，并通过接触感知编码器和注意力机制提升生成质量。

Result: 在OMOMO和3D-FUTURE数据集上取得了最先进的结果，展示了对未见物体的强泛化能力，并实现了高保真的4D HOI生成。

Conclusion: GenHOI通过两阶段框架有效解决了4D HOI合成的挑战，减少了对大规模4D数据集的依赖，并在公开数据集上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: While diffusion models and large-scale motion datasets have advanced
text-driven human motion synthesis, extending these advances to 4D human-object
interaction (HOI) remains challenging, mainly due to the limited availability
of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. In our study, we introduce GenHOI, a novel
two-stage framework aimed at achieving two key objectives: 1) generalization to
unseen objects and 2) the synthesis of high-fidelity 4D HOI sequences. In the
initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct
sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI
datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets.
Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the
second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely
temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D
HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to
extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention
to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.
Experimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
publicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong
generalization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI
generation.

*Xinkai Zhao,Yuta Tokuoka,Junichiro Iwasawa,Keita Oda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医学图像扩散模型的频率校准重建误差（FCRE）方法，用于成员推理攻击（MIA），通过关注中频范围的重建误差来提高隐私风险评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在敏感领域（如医学成像）中的应用增加，隐私问题日益突出。现有的成员推理攻击方法依赖重建误差，但在医学图像上效果不佳，主要因为高频细节重建困难和图像固有难度的影响。

Method: 提出FCRE方法，通过分析反向扩散过程，计算中频范围的重建误差，并结合结构相似性指数评分来确定成员资格，排除了高频和低频区域的干扰。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FCRE方法优于现有的MIA方法。

Conclusion: FCRE方法有效解决了医学图像扩散模型中的隐私风险评估问题，通过频率选择性策略提高了成员推理攻击的准确性。

Abstract: The increasing use of diffusion models for image generation, especially in
sensitive areas like medical imaging, has raised significant privacy concerns.
Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to
determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus
quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion
reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower
reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods
directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced
by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency
detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a
Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical
image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific
mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to
reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our
frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image
difficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the
mid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index
score between the reconstructed and original images. Membership is determined
by comparing this score to a threshold. Experiments on several medical image
datasets demonstrate that our FCRE method outperforms existing MIA methods.

TL;DR: CLAIM框架通过临床知识引导的LGE图像增强和联合训练策略，实现了心肌疤痕的逼真合成与精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量疤痕标签的LGE图像有限且多变，限制了稳健分割模型的发展，因此需要一种能够生成多样化且解剖学一致的疤痕图像的方法。

Method: 提出CLAIM框架，包含SMILE模块（基于临床知识的疤痕掩模生成）和联合训练策略，利用扩散模型生成解剖学一致的疤痕图像，并优化分割网络。

Result: CLAIM生成的疤痕图像解剖学一致性高，与真实疤痕分布的Dice相似性优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CLAIM能够可控且逼真地合成心肌疤痕，并提升下游医学影像任务的实用性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based myocardial scar segmentation from late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) cardiac MRI has shown great potential for accurate and timely
diagnosis and treatment planning for structural cardiac diseases. However, the
limited availability and variability of LGE images with high-quality scar
labels restrict the development of robust segmentation models. To address this,
we introduce CLAIM: \textbf{C}linically-Guided \textbf{L}GE
\textbf{A}ugmentation for Real\textbf{i}stic and Diverse \textbf{M}yocardial
Scar Synthesis and Segmentation framework, a framework for anatomically
grounded scar generation and segmentation. At its core is the SMILE module
(Scar Mask generation guided by cLinical knowledgE), which conditions a
diffusion-based generator on the clinically adopted AHA 17-segment model to
synthesize images with anatomically consistent and spatially diverse scar
patterns. In addition, CLAIM employs a joint training strategy in which the
scar segmentation network is optimized alongside the generator, aiming to
enhance both the realism of synthesized scars and the accuracy of the scar
segmentation performance. Experimental results show that CLAIM produces
anatomically coherent scar patterns and achieves higher Dice similarity with
real scar distributions compared to baseline models. Our approach enables
controllable and realistic myocardial scar synthesis and has demonstrated
utility for downstream medical imaging task.

*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双重LoRA学习范式，通过结合Cross-Frame Retrieval模块和两个LoRA分支（C-LoRA和D-LoRA），在保持时间一致性的同时增强视频超分辨率的空间细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于稳定扩散（SD）的真实视频超分辨率（Real-VSR）方法往往在追求时间一致性时牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。论文旨在解决如何在低质量输入视频中提取抗退化的时间一致性先验，并在增强细节的同时保持这些先验。

Method: 论文提出了双重LoRA学习（DLoRAL）范式，包括一个跨帧检索（CFR）模块和两个LoRA分支：一致性LoRA（C-LoRA）用于学习时间表示，细节LoRA（D-LoRA）用于增强空间细节。两个阶段交替优化，最终合并到SD模型中实现高效高质量的视频恢复。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在准确性和速度上均表现出色，能够同时实现真实的帧细节和时间一致性。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双重LoRA学习和跨帧信息聚合，成功地在视频超分辨率任务中平衡了细节增强和时间一致性，为Real-VSR领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在悖论：图像质量偏离人类感知时，模型表现反而可能提升。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但输入视觉质量如何影响其响应尚不明确。作者旨在探究图像感知质量是否直接关联模型理解能力，并解决模型对视觉质量的特殊偏好问题。

Method: 提出Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)：1）在冻结的视觉编码器前插入可学习的低秩核以调制频率内容；2）通过LoRA仅微调浅层视觉编码器。该方法动态调整输入图像，无需外部模型或额外数据。

Result: VQ-TTT在所有测试数据集和MLLMs上显著提升了平均准确率，且无需依赖外部模型、缓存特征或额外训练数据。实验揭示了模型对非人类标准“高质量”图像的偏好。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs所需的“更好”视觉输入，表明AI时代需要自适应而非普遍“干净”的图像。VQ-TTT为模型与视觉质量的动态适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法存在训练不稳定和码书崩溃问题，主要源于特征与码向量分布不匹配，导致码向量不具代表性和数据信息丢失。

Method: 采用Wasserstein距离对齐特征和码向量分布，确保码向量能有效代表特征分布，提升训练稳定性和码书利用率。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，该方法实现了接近100%的码书利用率，并显著降低了量化误差。

Conclusion: 通过分布对齐策略，论文有效解决了向量量化中的关键问题，为自回归模型的成功提供了更稳定的基础。

Abstract: The success of autoregressive models largely depends on the effectiveness of
vector quantization, a technique that discretizes continuous features by
mapping them to the nearest code vectors within a learnable codebook. Two
critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training
instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the
gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially
in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse
occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A
closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a
mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to
unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during
compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these
two distributions, achieving near 100\% codebook utilization and significantly
reducing the quantization error. Both empirical and theoretical analyses
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NERO的新型OOD评分机制，通过利用特征层的神经元级相关性来增强OOD检测能力，并在胃肠道影像基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像领域，确保深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，特别是能够识别分布外（OOD）样本以避免潜在异常被忽视。现有方法在捕捉OOD多样性方面存在不足，因此需要更有效的OOD检测方法。

Method: 提出NERO机制，通过聚类每个分布内（ID）类的神经元级相关性形成代表性中心点，并引入相关性距离度量来量化新样本与这些中心点的偏差。此外，通过在偏置项中引入缩放相关性和结合特征范数来优化性能。

Result: 在胃肠道影像基准测试Kvasir和GastroVision上，NERO在多种深度学习架构中表现优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: NERO通过神经元级相关性显著提升了OOD检测能力，为医学影像领域的可靠诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring reliability is paramount in deep learning, particularly within the
domain of medical imaging, where diagnostic decisions often hinge on model
outputs. The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven
to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical
imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag
potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD
detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works
suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this,
we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages
neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster
neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form
representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify
a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability.
Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the
bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable
OOD detection. We validate its effectiveness across multiple deep learning
architectures on the gastrointestinal imaging benchmarks Kvasir and
GastroVision, achieving improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection
methods.

TL;DR: ViMaR是一种新型的两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边界感知奖励调整，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率和输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型推理方法计算成本高，且容易产生低置信度的生成结果，导致持续的幻觉问题。

Method: ViMaR采用两阶段推理框架：第一阶段通过单次推理筛选出最佳候选描述；第二阶段仅对视觉基础薄弱的部分进行选择性优化，并通过边界惩罚机制抑制低置信度生成。

Result: 实验表明ViMaR能生成更可靠、准确且详细的描述，速度提升4倍以上，并展现出强大的跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViMaR作为一种可扩展、可迁移的推理策略，不仅能提升模型输出质量，还能通过自训练显著提高视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

### [222] [Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14803)
*Arbind Agrahari Baniya,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Peter W. Eklund,Sunil Aryal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新型的360度视频超分辨率模型S3PO，通过构建专用数据集和优化算法，解决了传统超分辨率技术在360度视频上的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在虚拟现实中广泛应用，但其空间分辨率有限，影响视觉质量。传统视频超分辨率技术无法有效处理360度视频的投影失真，且缺乏相关数据集进行研究。

Method: 论文创建了360VDS数据集，并提出了S3PO模型，该模型采用循环建模和注意力机制，结合专用特征提取器和针对球形失真的损失函数。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上表现优于大多数现有传统和专用超分辨率模型，并通过逐步消融研究验证了各子组件的有效性。

Conclusion: S3PO为360度视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案，通过针对性优化显著提升了视觉质量，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

### [223] [MODS: Multi-source Observations Conditional Diffusion Model for Meteorological State Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14798)
*Siwei Tu,Jingyi Xu,Weidong Yang,Lei Bai,Ben Fei*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 提出多源观测降尺度模型（MODS），通过融合多卫星和地形数据提升气象变量降尺度精度至6.25公里分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降尺度方法依赖单一卫星数据，无法全面捕捉气象变量变化，导致结果偏离实际。

Method: MODS结合多源卫星数据（GridSat、AMSU-A等）和地形数据，通过条件扩散模型和多源交叉注意力模块融合特征。

Result: 实验显示MODS在6.25公里分辨率下显著提高降尺度结果的真实性。

Conclusion: MODS通过多源数据融合有效提升气象降尺度精度，更贴近实际观测。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is
critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly
applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at
specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that
deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods
primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites
and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data
from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the
changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,
we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its
inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more
realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve
the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we
propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a
conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary
satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and
topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5
reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional
inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source
cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between
reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates
atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During
sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution
ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental
results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5
maps to a 6.25 km resolution.

### [224] [Collaborative Interest-aware Graph Learning for Group Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14826)
*Rui Zhao,Beihong Jin,Beibei Li,Yiyuan Zheng*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出CI4GI模型，通过双层次兴趣协同演化关系改进群组推荐，解决现有方法忽略群组兴趣对项目兴趣的增强及跨层次兴趣对齐中的假负样本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群组识别方法未能充分建模用户群组层次与项目层次兴趣间的协同演化关系，且跨层次兴趣对齐时存在假负样本干扰。

Method: 设计兴趣增强策略补充用户项目兴趣，并通过兴趣分布距离优化负样本识别以减少跨层次对齐干扰。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CI4GI显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: CI4GI通过建模双层次兴趣协同演化关系，有效提升了群组推荐的准确性。

Abstract: With the popularity of social media, an increasing number of users are
joining group activities on online social platforms. This elicits the
requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to
users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level
interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution
relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further
prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to
align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this
collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level
interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples
when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative
evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a
Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we
design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of
users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a
supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between
interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative
samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples
during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models.

### [225] [Detecting Narrative Shifts through Persistent Structures: A Topological Analysis of Media Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14836)
*Mark M. Bailey,Mark I. Heiligman*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于持续同调的拓扑框架，用于检测重大事件如何重塑公共话语结构，通过分析名词短语共现图的变化来追踪叙事演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种无监督方法，以数学原理检测全球事件对公共话语结构的根本性影响，无需事先了解具体事件。

Method: 通过构建名词短语的每日共现图，利用Vietoris-Rips过滤生成持续图，计算Wasserstein距离和持续熵来捕捉语义中断和叙事波动。

Result: 研究发现重大事件与H0（连通组件）和H1（循环）的急剧增加相关，表明叙事结构的突然重组，且H0变化通常先于H1。

Conclusion: 持续同调提供了一种数学上严谨的方法，用于实时检测危机、抗议和信息冲击期间的语义重构，推动了计算社会科学的发展。

Abstract: How can we detect when global events fundamentally reshape public discourse?
This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change
in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news
articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine
(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol
insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we
construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving
discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram
via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and
persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic
disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major
geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected
components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative
structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag
pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order
motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An
exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads
H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse
adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse
narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a
mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points
and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge
of specific events. This topological approach advances computational social
science by enabling real-time detection of semantic restructuring during
crises, protests, and information shocks.

### [226] [Comparative Analysis of QNN Architectures for Wind Power Prediction: Feature Maps and Ansatz Configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14795)
*Batuhan Hangun,Emine Akpinar,Oguz Altun,Onder Eyecioglu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与经典机器学习，通过量子特性提升性能。本文评估了量子神经网络（QNN）在风能预测中的表现，证明其优于经典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子机器学习潜力巨大，但由于当前NISQ设备的限制，其实际优势受到质疑。本研究旨在通过评估QNN的性能，验证QML在现实任务中的可行性。

Method: 系统构建了12种不同的QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，并在风能数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，使用Z特征映射的QNN在仅用四个输入参数预测风能输出时，准确率高达93%，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNN在预测任务中表现优异，证明了QML在实际应用中的潜力，为未来研究提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的正则化方法，用于在量子机器学习（QML）中平衡电路切割带来的采样开销与模型准确性，以探索量子优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NISQ硬件的限制（如电路深度和连接性）阻碍了量子优势的验证和关键问题（如贫瘠高原）的实证研究。电路切割技术虽能帮助在较小硬件上运行较大电路，但会增加采样开销。

Method: 在QML优化过程中引入一种新的正则化项，直接惩罚与采样相关的开销，从而优化电路切割的优势与典型ML成本函数之间的平衡。

Result: 该方法能够有效平衡电路切割的开销与模型准确性，为研究更大规模的复杂问题以追求量子优势提供了可能。

Conclusion: 通过引入正则化项，该工作为在有限硬件条件下探索量子优势提供了一种可行路径，同时兼顾了采样效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Result: QMKL-SVM模型相比经典方法获得显著更高的AUC分数，证实了量子计算在化学信息学任务中的优势。

Conclusion: 量子多核学习框架为挑战性QSAR分类问题提供了可行的量子优势解决方案。

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone
of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful
application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance
QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical
methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase
inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into
numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained
on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By
benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show
that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting
its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics
classification tasks.

Motivation: 研究干预的可识别性问题，旨在评估某些给定干预的总效应是否可以用无do公式表示，从而仅通过观测数据计算。

Method: 在时间序列背景下，考虑多干预和多效应，使用摘要因果图的形式，研究基于共同后门集的识别方法。

Result: 建立了时间序列中（无论是否具有时间一致性）存在共同后门集的条件，并提供了复杂度有限的算法来判断可识别性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了时间序列中干预可识别性的条件和算法，为仅使用观测数据计算干预效应提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the
total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula,
and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem,
considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time
series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary
causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a
common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without
consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also
provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is
identifiable or not.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Deformer的变形卷积网络，用于改进语音识别性能，通过自适应视图发现与注意力机制更匹配的局部特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络（CNN）在处理语音识别时，假设时间-频率模式是对称且刚性的，这限制了模型捕捉不对称模式的能力。

Method: 在Conformer架构中，用可变形卷积（Deformer）替代深度卷积，通过自适应视图优化局部特征与注意力机制的耦合。

Result: Deformer在WSJ eval92数据集上，无语言模型时相对WER提升5.6%，有语言模型时提升6.4%。

Conclusion: Deformer通过可变形卷积有效提升了语音识别性能，展示了自适应视图在特征提取中的优势。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have improved speech recognition
performance greatly by exploiting localized time-frequency patterns. But these
patterns are assumed to appear in symmetric and rigid kernels by the
conventional CNN operation. It motivates the question: What about asymmetric
kernels? In this study, we illustrate adaptive views can discover local
features which couple better with attention than fixed views of the input. We
replace depthwise CNNs in the Conformer architecture with a deformable
counterpart, dubbed this "Deformer". By analyzing our best-performing model, we
visualize both local receptive fields and global attention maps learned by the
Deformer and show increased feature associations on the utterance level. The
statistical analysis of learned kernel offsets provides an insight into the
change of information in features with the network depth. Finally, replacing
only half of the layers in the encoder, the Deformer improves +5.6% relative
WER without a LM and +6.4% relative WER with a LM over the Conformer baseline
on the WSJ eval92 set.

Method: 采用自适应掩码方法，动态调整子网络结构，避免过早固定子网络，适用于稀疏单语言模型或稀疏多语言模型。

Result: 该方法在稀疏单语言模型上优于现有剪枝方法，并能通过不同子网络初始化联合发现和训练更好的多语言子网络。

Conclusion: 动态ASR路径方法减少了语言特定剪枝的需求，提升了多语言模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural network pruning offers an effective method for compressing a
multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with minimal performance
loss. However, it entails several rounds of pruning and re-training needed to
be run for each language. In this work, we propose the use of an adaptive
masking approach in two scenarios for pruning a multilingual ASR model
efficiently, each resulting in sparse monolingual models or a sparse
multilingual model (named as Dynamic ASR Pathways). Our approach dynamically
adapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network
structure. We show that our approach outperforms existing pruning methods when
targeting sparse monolingual models. Further, we illustrate that Dynamic ASR
Pathways jointly discovers and trains better sub-networks (pathways) of a
single multilingual model by adapting from different sub-network
initializations, thereby reducing the need for language-specific pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低资源ASR任务，现有方法在数据增强和正则化方面仍有改进空间，MixRep旨在通过更有效的特征插值和正则化提升模型表现。

Method: MixRep在神经网络的隐藏表示中进行特征维度插值，适用于声学特征输入和每层输出，并结合时间轴正则化，应用于Conformer编码器和E2E LAS架构。

Result: 在WSJ和SWB数据集上，MixRep相比其他正则化方法表现更优，相对WER在eval92和eval'2000集上分别降低6.5%和6.7%。

Conclusion: MixRep作为一种简单有效的数据增强策略，显著提升了低资源ASR任务的性能，尤其在结合时间轴正则化时表现更佳。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MixRep, a simple and effective data augmentation
strategy based on mixup for low-resource ASR. MixRep interpolates the feature
dimensions of hidden representations in the neural network that can be applied
to both the acoustic feature input and the output of each layer, which
generalizes the previous MixSpeech method. Further, we propose to combine the
mixup with a regularization along the time axis of the input, which is shown as
complementary. We apply MixRep to a Conformer encoder of an E2E LAS
architecture trained with a joint CTC loss. We experiment on the WSJ dataset
and subsets of the SWB dataset, covering reading and telephony conversational
speech. Experimental results show that MixRep consistently outperforms other
regularization methods for low-resource ASR. Compared to a strong SpecAugment
baseline, MixRep achieves a +6.5\% and a +6.7\% relative WER reduction on the
eval92 set and the Callhome part of the eval'2000 set.

Motivation: 为了在单一模型中统一语音的声学细节和词汇意义，提高语音生成和理解任务的效果。

Method: HAC利用HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，分别提取音素和词汇信息，构建分层瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，HAC在英语和多语言数据上优于单层基线，保持了自然性并提供了可解释的语音信息。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，有望在语音生成和理解任务中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel
audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research.
In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that
leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech

enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key
techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive

Conclusion: 该模型为早期预警系统和人道主义响应规划提供了有力工具，且易于扩展整合其他数据源。

Abstract: Forecasting violent conflict at high spatial and temporal resolution remains
a central challenge for both researchers and policymakers. This study presents
a novel neural network architecture for forecasting three distinct types of
violence -- state-based, non-state, and one-sided -- at the subnational
(priogrid-month) level, up to 36 months in advance. The model jointly performs
classification and regression tasks, producing both probabilistic estimates and
expected magnitudes of future events. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across all tasks and generates approximate predictive posterior distributions
to quantify forecast uncertainty.
  The architecture is built on a Monte Carlo Dropout Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) U-Net, integrating convolutional layers to capture spatial dependencies
with recurrent structures to model temporal dynamics. Unlike many existing
approaches, it requires no manual feature engineering and relies solely on
historical conflict data. This design enables the model to autonomously learn
complex spatiotemporal patterns underlying violent conflict.
  Beyond achieving state-of-the-art predictive performance, the model is also
highly extensible: it can readily integrate additional data sources and jointly
forecast auxiliary variables. These capabilities make it a promising tool for
early warning systems, humanitarian response planning, and evidence-based
peacebuilding initiatives.

Abstract: Structural vibrations are a source of unwanted noise in engineering systems
like cars, trains or airplanes. Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for
improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization
approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing
beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a
generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict
structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model
pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to
low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data
implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential
solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required.
We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives,
including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful
construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method
generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural
vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design
heuristic and genetic optimization. The code and data are available from
https://github.com/ecker-lab/Optimizing_Vibrating_Plates.

Abstract: Knowledge extraction through sound is a distinctive property. Visually
impaired individuals often rely solely on Braille books and audio recordings
provided by NGOs. Due to limitations in these approaches, blind individuals
often cannot access books of their choice. Speech is a more effective mode of
communication than text for blind and visually impaired persons, as they can
easily respond to sounds. This paper presents the development of an accurate,
reliable, cost-effective, and user-friendly optical character recognition
(OCR)-based speech synthesis system. The OCR-based system has been implemented
using Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW).

### [239] [SonicVerse: Multi-Task Learning for Music Feature-Informed Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15154)
*Anuradha Chopra,Abhinaba Roy,Dorien Herremans*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SonicVerse是一个多任务音乐描述模型，通过结合音乐特征检测和描述生成，提升音乐描述的丰富性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的音乐描述可以丰富音乐数据库并推动音乐AI研究，但现有方法往往缺乏对音乐特征的深入捕捉。

Method: 提出基于投影的架构，将音频输入转换为语言标记，同时通过辅助头检测音乐特征，并将特征投影为语言标记以增强描述输入。

Result: 实验表明，结合音乐特征的方法显著提高了生成描述的细节和质量。

Conclusion: SonicVerse通过多任务学习和特征整合，能够生成更丰富、准确的音乐描述，适用于短片段和长音乐作品。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同模型在噪声抑制、感知质量和说话人特征保留方面各有优势，可根据具体应用需求选择合适的模型。这些发现对语音生物识别、法医音频分析、电信和说话人验证等领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Speech enhancement, particularly denoising, is vital in improving the
intelligibility and quality of speech signals for real-world applications,
especially in noisy environments. While prior research has introduced various
deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise
suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation,
leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation.
This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and
U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These
models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code
accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise
suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and
+364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality,
attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it
well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.
Wave-U-Net balances these attributes with improvements in speaker-specific
feature retention, evidenced by VeriSpeak score gains of +10.84% on SpEAR and
+27.38% on VPQAD. This research indicates how advanced methods can optimize
trade-offs between noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker
recognition. The findings may contribute to advancing voice biometrics,
forensic audio analysis, telecommunication, and speaker verification in
challenging acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用预训练文本到音乐扩散模型进行乐器编辑的方法，通过选择合适的时间步长平衡内容保留与音色调整，无需额外训练且不影响生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成模型难以精确控制生成结果，细微的文本提示变化会导致输出音乐显著不同。为此，研究者探索如何利用现有模型对音频中的乐器进行编辑，同时保留原始内容。

Method: 基于扩散模型在生成过程中先关注音频结构、再添加乐器信息的特点，使用乐器分类器识别中间时间步长，实现内容保留与目标音色的平衡。

Result: 该方法成功实现了对现有音频轨道的乐器编辑，无需重新训练模型，且保持了生成过程的效率。

Conclusion: 通过智能选择扩散模型的中间时间步长，可以有效地编辑音频中的乐器音色，同时保留原始音乐内容，为音乐创作提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the
creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition
and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation
process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.
Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can
drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the
application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing.
Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained
text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the
underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the
overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information,
and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen
intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a
balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the
desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the
text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's
speed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型学习规则，通过扩展STDP方法同时学习突触连接强度和延迟，在SNN模型中验证了其有效性，并展示了突触效能与延迟之间的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经元网络中突触延迟的调节在哺乳动物学习过程中被观察到，但在神经形态计算领域的SNN模拟中却很少被纳入。

Method: 通过扩展常用的Hebbian方法STDP，提出了一种同时学习突触连接强度和延迟的新型学习规则，并在无监督学习的SNN分类模型中进行了验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种测试场景中均表现出优越性能，并揭示了突触效能与延迟之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了SNN模型的生物仿真度，还为理解突触延迟在学习中的作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Synaptic delays play a crucial role in biological neuronal networks, where
their modulation has been observed in mammalian learning processes. In the
realm of neuromorphic computing, although spiking neural networks (SNNs) aim to
emulate biology more closely than traditional artificial neural networks do,
synaptic delays are rarely incorporated into their simulation. We introduce a
novel learning rule for simultaneously learning synaptic connection strengths
and delays, by extending spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a Hebbian
method commonly used for learning synaptic weights. We validate our approach by
extending a widely-used SNN model for classification trained with unsupervised
learning. Then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method by comparing
it against another existing methods for co-learning synaptic weights and delays
as well as against STDP without synaptic delays. Results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently achieves superior performance across a variety of
test scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results yield insight into the
interplay between synaptic efficacy and delay.

Method: 通过测量小动物成像系统的梯度波形训练时间卷积网络，预测梯度系统产生的非线性失真。

Abstract: Summary: Errors in gradient trajectories introduce significant artifacts and
distortions in magnetic resonance images, particularly in non-Cartesian imaging
sequences, where imperfect gradient waveforms can greatly reduce image quality.
Purpose: Our objective is to develop a general, nonlinear gradient system model
that can accurately predict gradient distortions using convolutional networks.
Methods: A set of training gradient waveforms were measured on a small animal
imaging system, and used to train a temporal convolutional network to predict
the gradient waveforms produced by the imaging system. Results: The trained
network was able to accurately predict nonlinear distortions produced by the
gradient system. Network prediction of gradient waveforms was incorporated into
the image reconstruction pipeline and provided improvements in image quality
and diffusion parameter mapping compared to both the nominal gradient waveform
and the gradient impulse response function. Conclusion: Temporal convolutional
networks can more accurately model gradient system behavior than existing
linear methods and may be used to retrospectively correct gradient errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图滤波器在处理具有树状分支结构的层次图时面临挑战，需要一种新的方法来有效处理这类结构。

Method: 引入边界加权算子，利用Busemann函数在delta-双曲网络上重新缩放每条边，根据端点向Gromov边界的漂移距离。

Result: 证明了算子谱范数的闭形式上界，信号每次通过时会损失曲率控制的能量，提供了一种无参数、轻量级的滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法为具有密集或隐藏层次结构数据的图信号处理提供了新的分析工具，直接从几何原理出发保证了稳定性。

Abstract: Hierarchical graphs often exhibit tree-like branching patterns, a structural
property that challenges the design of traditional graph filters. We introduce
a boundary-weighted operator that rescales each edge according to how far its
endpoints drift toward the graph's Gromov boundary. Using Busemann functions on
delta-hyperbolic networks, we prove a closed-form upper bound on the operator's
spectral norm: every signal loses a curvature-controlled fraction of its energy
at each pass. The result delivers a parameter-free, lightweight filter whose
stability follows directly from geometric first principles, offering a new
analytic tool for graph signal processing on data with dense or hidden
hierarchical structure.

TL;DR: 使用GemNet-T作为机器学习力场，比较了直接训练和预训练两种策略，发现预训练能显著提升分子动力学模拟的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习力场（MLFFs）可以加速从头算分子动力学（MD）模拟，但准确预测力通常计算成本高昂。本文旨在探索如何通过预训练提升模拟稳定性。

Method: 采用GemNet-T图神经网络模型，比较两种训练策略：1) 直接在MD17数据集（10K样本）上训练；2) 在大规模OC20数据集上预训练后，在MD17上微调。

Result: 两种方法均达到较低的力平均绝对误差（5 meV/A），但预训练模型显著提升了模拟稳定性，轨迹持续时间比从头训练模型长三倍。

Conclusion: 预训练能有效捕捉复杂分子相互作用，提升模拟稳定性；力的平均绝对误差不足以完全衡量模拟稳定性。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution
for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate
force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this
work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and
investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples)
without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset
followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force
mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower
force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the
pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability,
sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from
scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse
datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE
alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.

Motivation: 地下流体注入引发的小地震（MEQs）记录了储层的应力状态和渗透性变化，预测其时空演化对于增强地热系统（EGS）、CO2封存等地质工程应用至关重要。

Method: 作者开发了一种基于Transformer的深度学习模型，该模型利用水力压裂历史和先前的MEQ观测数据，预测四个关键指标：累计MEQ数量、累计对数地震矩以及MEQ云的50%和95%分位数范围（P50, P95）。

Result: 在EGS Collab Experiment 1数据集上，该模型在1秒预测时间范围内实现了R² >0.98，在15秒预测时间范围内实现了R² >0.88，并通过学习标准差项提供了不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该模型能够实时推断裂缝扩展和渗透性演化，展示了深度学习方法在改善地震风险评估和指导流体注入操作缓解策略方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the
evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full
spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other
geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning
model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to
forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic
seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of
the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model
achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the
15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty
estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate,
uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture
propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of
deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide
mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as GPT-4 with 1.8

to ensure scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our work provides a
comprehensive co-design framework that jointly explores FLOPS, HBM bandwidth
and capacity, multiple network topologies (two-tier vs. FullFlat optical), the
size of the scale-out domain, and popular parallelism/optimization strategies
used in LLMs. We introduce and evaluate FullFlat network architectures, which
provide uniform high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity between all nodes, and
demonstrate their transformative impact on performance and scalability. Through
detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute
and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out
domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of
experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices
affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens

study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of
predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements. Our findings
offer actionable insights and a practical roadmap for designing AI data centers

Method: 利用范式微分计算理论证明自注意力机制对软最大激活的不变性，构建层次分区树分析网络3-张量的结构，并通过视觉和语言Transformer进行实例验证。

Result: 发现自注意力机制的结构特性可用于模型剪枝和架构比较，同时为下游可解释性任务提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文的理论和方法为Transformer模型的可解释性和实际应用提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst
the attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.
Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax
activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is
supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic
organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing
methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network
structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,
key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential
since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a
geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify
this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree
comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and
quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion
coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect
to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and
heads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and
methodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and
language transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a
subsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can
be exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use
the network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as
model pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture
comparison.

Motivation: Softmax Loss（SL）和Cosine Contrastive Loss（CCL）在优化推荐模型中表现优异，但各有局限性：SL对假阴性样本敏感，CCL数据利用率低。需探索其理论联系与差异，并提出改进方案。

Method: 通过分布鲁棒优化（DRO）框架分析SL和CCL，提出基于Rényi散度的新损失函数DrRL，综合两者优势结构。

Result: 实验表明DrRL能有效缓解SL和CCL的缺陷，在推荐准确性和鲁棒性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DrRL通过Rényi散度统一了SL和CCL的优化目标，为推荐系统损失函数设计提供了更优解。

Abstract: Loss functions play a pivotal role in optimizing recommendation models. Among
various loss functions, Softmax Loss (SL) and Cosine Contrastive Loss (CCL) are
particularly effective. Their theoretical connections and differences warrant
in-depth exploration. This work conducts comprehensive analyses of these
losses, yielding significant insights: 1) Common strengths -- both can be
viewed as augmentations of traditional losses with Distributional Robust
Optimization (DRO), enhancing robustness to distributional shifts; 2)
Respective limitations -- stemming from their use of different distribution
distance metrics in DRO optimization, SL exhibits high sensitivity to false
negative instances, whereas CCL suffers from low data utilization. To address
these limitations, this work proposes a new loss function, DrRL, which
generalizes SL and CCL by leveraging R\'enyi-divergence in DRO optimization.
DrRL incorporates the advantageous structures of both SL and CCL, and can be
demonstrated to effectively mitigate their limitations. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to validate the superiority of DrRL on both recommendation
accuracy and robustness.

### [252] [Proximal Operators of Sorted Nonconvex Penalties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15315)
*Anne Gagneux,Mathurin Massias,Emmanuel Soubies*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文研究了稀疏信号恢复中的变量自动分组问题，提出了一种基于排序非光滑惩罚的正则化方法，并提供了计算其近端算子的高效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏信号恢复中，变量自动分组是一个重要问题。传统的L1正则化方法无法有效促进变量聚类，且可能导致系数过度收缩。因此，需要一种既能促进变量聚类又能减少系数收缩的正则化方法。

Method: 论文提出了一类排序非凸惩罚函数，扩展了SLOPE方法。针对弱凸和非凸两种情况，分别使用PAV算法及其改进版本计算近端算子。

Result: 在弱凸情况下（如sorted MCP和SCAD），PAV算法能精确计算近端算子；在非凸情况下（如sorted Lq），改进的PAV算法也能高效计算。实验证明了这些方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 排序非凸惩罚函数在稀疏信号恢复中具有显著优势，能有效促进变量聚类并减少系数收缩。论文提出的计算方法为实际应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: This work studies the problem of sparse signal recovery with automatic
grouping of variables. To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties
as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a
family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm
(SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to
their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of
coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal
operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite
optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish
between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the
proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where
computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial
problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how
the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal
operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that
a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to
tackle the computation of the proximal operator. We also present new
theoretical insights on the minimizers of the nonconvex proximal problem. We
demonstrate the practical interest of using such penalties on several
experiments.

### [253] [Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding for Distributed Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15387)
*Junhui Zhang,Patrick Jaillet*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了两种针对非光滑分布式凸优化问题的多时间尺度梯度滑动方法（MT-GS和AMT-GS），通过利用目标函数的相似性和灵活通信策略减少通信轮次，并达到最优的收敛复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式优化中通信开销大的问题，特别是在非光滑目标函数下，如何通过利用局部目标函数的相似性和灵活通信策略来减少通信轮次，同时保持算法的确定性。

Method: 基于块可分解的原始-对偶形式化和多时间尺度滑动方法，不同对偶块可以以不同的速率更新，从而灵活适应不同子集的通信需求。

Result: MT-GS和AMT-GS在非光滑目标函数下分别达到最优的通信轮次和次梯度步数复杂度，且AMT-GS在强凸目标函数下进一步提升了收敛速度。

Conclusion: 提出的MT-GS和AMT-GS方法在非光滑分布式优化中实现了通信轮次的线性依赖和最优收敛复杂度，为相关问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose two first-order methods for convex, non-smooth, distributed
optimization problems, hereafter called Multi-Timescale Gradient Sliding
(MT-GS) and its accelerated variant (AMT-GS). Our MT-GS and AMT-GS can take
advantage of similarities between (local) objectives to reduce the
communication rounds, are flexible so that different subsets (of agents) can
communicate at different, user-picked rates, and are fully deterministic. These
three desirable features are achieved through a block-decomposable primal-dual
formulation, and a multi-timescale variant of the sliding method introduced in
Lan et al. (2020), Lan (2016), where different dual blocks are updated at
potentially different rates.
  To find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution, the complexities of our algorithms
achieve optimal dependency on $\epsilon$: MT-GS needs
$O(\overline{r}A/\epsilon)$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/\epsilon^2)$ subgradient steps for Lipchitz objectives, and
AMT-GS needs $O(\overline{r}A/\sqrt{\epsilon\mu})$ communication rounds and
$O(\overline{r}/(\epsilon\mu))$ subgradient steps if the objectives are also
$\mu$-strongly convex. Here, $\overline{r}$ measures the ``average rate of
updates'' for dual blocks, and $A$ measures similarities between (subgradients
of) local functions. In addition, the linear dependency of communication rounds
on $A$ is optimal (Arjevani and Shamir 2015), thereby providing a positive
answer to the open question whether such dependency is achievable for
non-smooth objectives (Arjevani and Shamir 2015).

TL;DR: 论文提出Hermes系统，通过概率需求图(PDGraph)建模LLM应用的资源需求，结合Gittins策略优化调度顺序与后端预热，显著提升服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服务系统将LLM应用的资源需求视为黑箱，导致端到端效率低下，主要因排队顺序不当和后端预热延迟。

Method: 使用PDGraph建模资源需求，提出Hermes系统，应用Gittins策略优化调度顺序，并基于PDGraph在适当时机预热后端。

Result: 实验表明，Hermes平均完成时间降低70%以上，P95完成时间降低80%以上。

Conclusion: Hermes通过精准建模与动态调度，显著提升了LLM应用的服务效率。

Abstract: Applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) contains a series of tasks
to address real-world problems with boosted capability, which have dynamic
demand volumes on diverse backends. Existing serving systems treat the resource
demands of LLM applications as a blackbox, compromising end-to-end efficiency
due to improper queuing order and backend warm up latency. We find that the
resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate
manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which
leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications. Confronting
probabilistic demand description, Hermes applies the Gittins policy to
determine the scheduling order that can minimize the average application
completion time. It also uses the PDGraph model to help prewarm cold backends
at proper moments. Experiments with diverse LLM applications confirm that
Hermes can effectively improve the application serving efficiency, reducing the
average completion time by over 70% and the P95 completion time by over 80%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的代理应用计划缓存方法，通过提取、存储和重用结构化计划模板，显著降低了服务成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM缓存技术主要针对聊天机器人，无法有效支持依赖外部数据或环境上下文的代理应用，导致高昂的服务成本。

Method: 提出代理计划缓存方法，从已完成代理执行中提取计划模板，通过关键词匹配和轻量模型适配，实现跨任务的计划重用。

Result: 在多个实际代理应用中，平均降低46.62%的成本，同时保持性能不变。

Conclusion: 代理计划缓存是一种高效且互补的解决方案，适用于基于LLM的代理服务基础设施。

Abstract: LLM-based agentic applications have shown increasingly remarkable
capabilities in complex workflows but incur substantial costs due to extensive
planning and reasoning requirements. Existing LLM caching techniques (like
context caching and semantic caching), primarily designed for serving chatbots,
are insufficient for agentic applications where outputs depend on external data
or environmental contexts. We propose agentic plan caching, a novel approach
that extracts, stores, adapts, and reuses structured plan templates from
planning stages of agentic applications across semantically similar tasks to
reduce the cost of serving. Unlike traditional semantic caching, our system
extracts plan templates from completed agent executions at test-time, employs
keyword extraction to match new requests against cached plans, and utilizes
lightweight models to adapt these templates to task-specific plans with
contexts. Evaluation across multiple real-world agentic applications shows that
our system can reduce costs by 46.62% on average while maintaining performance,
offering a more efficient solution for serving LLM-based agents that
complements existing LLM serving infrastructures.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出CheckFree和CheckFree+方法，通过邻接阶段加权平均和乱序流水线执行，高效恢复LLM训练中的节点故障，降低通信和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分散和低性能计算节点上训练大型语言模型（LLM）可降低成本并促进模型民主化，但节点故障和调度策略导致阶段丢失，传统恢复方法如检查点和冗余计算开销大且扩展性差。

Method: CheckFree通过邻接阶段加权平均恢复中间阶段故障，无需额外计算或存储；CheckFree+扩展该方法，通过乱序流水线执行和邻接阶段权重复制，恢复首尾阶段故障。

Result: 在LLaMa模型（124M至1.5B）上测试，CheckFree和CheckFree+在低中故障率（5-10%）下，比传统方法收敛速度快12%以上。

Conclusion: CheckFree和CheckFree+提供了一种高效、低开销的故障恢复方法，适用于分散计算环境中的大规模LLM训练。

Abstract: Training LLMs on decentralized and wimpy computation nodes, e.g., multiple
on-spot instances, lowers the training cost and enables model democratization.
The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the
operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the
model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use
checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an
additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield
significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases
and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,
CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by
a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state
of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,
because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover
failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+
with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last
stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is
mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by
simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover
the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring
stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively
evaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with
varying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates
(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant
computation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%. Both of our
proposals can be run via our code available at:
https://github.com/gensyn-ai/CheckFree.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了BMFM-RNA，一个开源、模块化的转录组基础模型软件包，旨在统一不同的预训练和微调目标，并引入新的训练目标WCED，以提升基因表达分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前转录组基础模型（TFMs）的实现和训练策略多样，导致难以评估单个设计选择的贡献或它们的协同效应，限制了研究的可重复性和最佳实践的收敛。

Method: 提出了BMFM-RNA软件包，整合多种TFM预训练和微调目标，并引入新的训练目标WCED，通过自编码器式的CLS瓶颈表示捕捉全局表达模式。

Result: 在CELLxGENE上预训练的四个模型检查点显示，基于WCED的模型在零样本和微调任务中性能匹配或超越现有方法如scGPT。

Conclusion: BMFM-RNA为系统基准测试和社区驱动的TFM训练策略探索提供了可重复的基础，有助于开发更有效的工具以利用AI最新进展理解细胞生物学。

Abstract: Transcriptomic foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful
tools for analyzing gene expression in cells and tissues, supporting key tasks
such as cell-type annotation, batch correction, and perturbation prediction.
However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across
recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution
of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This
hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the
reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an
open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and
fine-tuning objectives within a single framework. Leveraging this capability,
we introduce a novel training objective, whole cell expression decoder (WCED),
which captures global expression patterns using an autoencoder-like CLS
bottleneck representation. In this paper, we describe the framework, supported
input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model
checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language
modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking
capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance
that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than
a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. BMFM-RNA, available
as part of the biomed-multi-omics project (
https://github.com/BiomedSciAI/biomed-multi-omic ), offers a reproducible
foundation for systematic benchmarking and community-driven exploration of
optimal TFM training strategies, enabling the development of more effective
tools to leverage the latest advances in AI for understanding cell biology.

Abstract: This study investigates the current landscape and future directions of
protein foundation model research. While recent advancements have transformed
protein science and engineering, the field lacks a comprehensive benchmark for
fair evaluation and in-depth understanding. Since ESM-1B, numerous protein
foundation models have emerged, each with unique datasets and methodologies.
However, evaluations often focus on limited tasks tailored to specific models,
hindering insights into broader generalization and limitations. Specifically,
researchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how
well current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in
developing new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a
comprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks
spanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17
state-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent
correlations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）代理的自动超参数调优方法，用于改进无人机通信算法WS-PSO-CM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于无人机通信算法WS-PSO-CM的超参数调优方法主要基于启发式，自动化程度低且性能不佳，因此需要一种更高效的自动调优方法。

Method: 设计了一个LLM代理，通过迭代框架和模型上下文协议（MCP）自动调优超参数，代理根据任务配置启动，并通过提示驱动迭代调用WS-PSO-CM算法进行探索。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM代理生成的超参数所实现的最小和速率显著高于人工启发式和随机生成方法。

Conclusion: 具备PSO知识和WS-PSO-CM算法背景的LLM代理在寻找高性能超参数方面非常有用。

Abstract: Hyper-parameters are essential and critical for the performance of
communication algorithms. However, current hyper-parameters tuning methods for
warm-start particles swarm optimization with cross and mutation (WS-PSO-CM)
algortihm for radio map-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory and
communication are primarily heuristic-based, exhibiting low levels of
automation and unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we design an large
language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an
iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied. In
particular, the LLM agent is first setup via a profile, which specifies the
mission, background, and output format. Then, the LLM agent is driven by the
prompt requirement, and iteratively invokes WS-PSO-CM algorithm for
exploration. Finally, the LLM agent autonomously terminates the loop and
returns a set of hyper-parameters. Our experiment results show that the minimal
sum-rate achieved by hyper-parameters generated via our LLM agent is
significantly higher than those by both human heuristics and random generation
methods. This indicates that an LLM agent with PSO knowledge and WS-PSO-CM
algorithm background is useful in finding high-performance hyper-parameters.

Result: 研究表明，ICL是一种原理性且高效的方法，能够利用导频信号和辅助上下文信息实现无线接收器的实时自适应。

Conclusion: ICL为无线接收器的实时自适应提供了一种无需在线重新训练的有效解决方案，适用于如无蜂窝大规模MIMO网络等场景。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless
receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge
traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware
architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically
adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies,
including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either
demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through
gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques
rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review
architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured
state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence
models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we
explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing
both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that
ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver
adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without
requiring online retraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索开发者常用的代码片段描述类型，并评估大型语言模型（如Llama）在支持描述生成方面的能力，特别是在第三方库的文档化方面。

Method: 研究使用了NPM代码片段数据集，包含185,412个包和1,024,579个代码片段，从中选取400个样本进行手动分类和LLM评估。

Result: 研究发现55.5%的原始描述基于示例，LLM正确识别了79.75%的示例描述，生成描述的相似度平均得分为0.7173，显示相关性但有待提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明代码片段的文档意图多样，LLM在生成相关描述方面表现良好，但仍需改进以达到更高的一致性。

Abstract: Documenting code snippets is essential to pinpoint key areas where both
developers and users should pay attention. Examples include usage examples and
other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important
for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the
key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and
evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description
generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with
1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their
descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the
majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This
finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions
lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified
the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical
to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared
to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of
0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9
indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the
code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions
for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a
library.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的计算机使用代理的普及，其安全性问题被忽视，而评估和理解其潜在危害行为对广泛应用至关重要。

Method: 在OSWorld环境上构建OS-Harm基准测试，包含150个任务，覆盖多种安全违规行为，并提出自动化评估方法。

Result: 评估显示，所有测试模型在用户滥用查询中直接遵从，对静态提示注入攻击较脆弱，偶尔会执行不安全操作。

Conclusion: OS-Harm基准测试为计算机使用代理的安全性提供了系统评估方法，揭示了当前模型的安全隐患。

Abstract: Computer use agents are LLM-based agents that can directly interact with a
graphical user interface, by processing screenshots or accessibility trees.
While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely
overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential
for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap,
we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use
agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test
models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt
injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150
tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright
infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to
interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser,
etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and
safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and
0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier
models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide
insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply
with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt
injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions. The OS-Harm benchmark is

Abstract: AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological

in rapid succession. We call these developments grand challenges. These
challenges include new weapons of mass destruction, AI-enabled autocracies,

meaningfully improve our prospects. AGI preparedness is therefore not just
about ensuring that advanced AI systems are aligned: we should be preparing,
now, for the disorienting range of developments an intelligence explosion would
bring.

### [265] [Hypothesis Testing for Quantifying LLM-Human Misalignment in Multiple Choice Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14997)
*Harbin Hong,Sebastian Caldas,Liu Leqi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个量化框架，用于评估大语言模型在模拟人类行为时的偏差，特别是在多选调查中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地应用于社会科学研究，评估这些模型模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设检验，提出了一个量化框架来评估大语言模型模拟行为与真实人类行为在多选调查中的偏差。

Result: 研究发现，流行的大语言模型在模拟特定子群体（如不同种族、年龄和收入）对争议性问题的意见时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了大语言模型在社会科学研究中模拟人类行为时的局限性，并呼吁开发新的实践方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

### [266] [Transit for All: Mapping Equitable Bike2Subway Connection using Region Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15113)
*Min Namgung,JangHyeon Lee,Fangyi Ding,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出Transit for All (TFA)框架，通过空间计算指导共享单车系统在纽约市低收入和少数族裔社区的公平扩展，以减少交通不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人口密集城市如纽约，低收入和少数族裔社区的公共交通可达性较差。共享单车系统(BSS)可作为经济实惠的首末公里解决方案，但传统方法难以预测新站点的需求并准确评估可达性。

Method: TFA框架包含三个部分：(1) 利用多模态地理空间数据进行区域表示学习，预测新站点的共享单车需求；(2) 结合预测需求和传统指标，提出加权公共交通可达性水平(wPTAL)；(3) 基于潜在乘客量和公平性提升，为新站点布局提供策略建议。

Result: 在纽约市的案例研究中，TFA识别出低收入和少数族裔社区的交通可达性差距，并证明通过wPTAL指导的新站点布局显著减少了与经济、人口因素相关的交通不平等。

Conclusion: TFA为城市规划者提供了促进交通公平的实用工具，可改善服务不足社区的生活质量。

Abstract: Ensuring equitable public transit access remains challenging, particularly in
densely populated cities like New York City (NYC), where low-income and
minority communities often face limited transit accessibility. Bike-sharing
systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and
last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved
neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly
planned ("cold-start") station locations and limitations in traditional
accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We
introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to
guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1)
spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using
region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2)
comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted
Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted
bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3)
strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider
potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we
identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income
and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results
show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces
disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors. From
our study, we demonstrate that TFA provides practical guidance for urban
planners to promote equitable transit and enhance the quality of life in
underserved urban communities.

*Christina Q. Knight,Kaustubh Deshpande,Ved Sirdeshmukh,Meher Mankikar,Scale Red Team,SEAL Research Team,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出了FORTRESS评估框架，用于测试大语言模型在国家安全和公共安全领域的防护机制有效性，并公开了数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展带来了双重用途能力，可能威胁或增强国家安全和公共安全（NSPS）。然而，现有的基准测试往往无法客观、稳健地评估模型防护机制对潜在NSPS风险的鲁棒性。

Method: 作者引入了FORTRESS：一个包含500个专家设计的对抗性提示的数据集，涵盖化学、生物、放射性、核与爆炸物（CBRNE）、政治暴力与恐怖主义、犯罪与金融非法活动三个领域，共10个子类别。每个提示-评分对都有一个对应的良性版本，用于测试模型的过度拒绝行为。

Result: 评估显示，不同模型在潜在风险和模型实用性之间存在不同的权衡。例如，Claude-3.5-Sonnet表现出较低的平均风险得分（14.09/100）但最高的过度拒绝得分（21.8/100），而Gemini 2.5 Pro则表现出较低的过度拒绝（1.4）但较高的潜在风险（66.29）。Deepseek-R1的平均风险得分最高（78.05），但过度拒绝得分最低（0.06）。

Conclusion: FORTRESS为政策制定者和研究人员提供了一个清晰的工具，用于理解大语言模型的潜在风险。作者公开了FORTRESS数据集，并保留了一个私有集用于评估。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) introduces dual-use
capabilities that could both threaten and bolster national security and public
safety (NSPS). Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse
relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information.
However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to
potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500
expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary
questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information
only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE),
Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities,
with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a
corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation
of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between
potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low
average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score
(ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but
a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at
78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even
trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and
ORS of 5.2). To provide policymakers and researchers with a clear understanding
of models' potential risks, we publicly release FORTRESS at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScaleAI/fortress_public. We also maintain a
private set for evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出F-MPPI框架，通过局部线性反馈增益增强标准MPPI，提升实时控制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPPI控制方法在复杂机器人任务中表现优异，但计算需求限制了其在实时高频控制中的应用。

Method: 引入F-MPPI框架，结合Riccati反馈的灵敏度分析，计算局部线性反馈增益，减少每步重新优化的需求。

Result: 仿真和实物实验表明，F-MPPI显著提升控制性能和稳定性，适用于复杂机器人系统的高频操作。

Conclusion: F-MPPI通过局部反馈增益有效解决了MPPI的实时性问题，适用于动态和高频机器人控制场景。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral control is a powerful sampling-based approach
suitable for complex robotic tasks due to its flexibility in handling nonlinear
dynamics and non-convex costs. However, its applicability in real-time,
highfrequency robotic control scenarios is limited by computational demands.
This paper introduces Feedback-MPPI (F-MPPI), a novel framework that augments
standard MPPI by computing local linear feedback gains derived from sensitivity
analysis inspired by Riccati-based feedback used in gradient-based MPC. These
gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without
requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two
robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven
terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard
computation. Results illustrate that incorporating local feedback significantly
improves control performance and stability, enabling robust, high-frequency
operation suitable for complex robotic systems.

TL;DR: FEAST是一个灵活的进餐辅助系统，通过模块化硬件和多样化交互方式满足个性化需求，并在实际应用中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球数百万人需要进食辅助，但家庭用餐辅助面临活动多样性、情境复杂性和用户偏好差异等挑战。

Method: FEAST系统采用模块化硬件、多样化交互方法和参数化行为树，结合大语言模型实现安全透明的个性化适配。

Result: FEAST在个性化需求满足上优于现有基线系统，并通过家庭用户研究和职业治疗师评估验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: FEAST系统成功实现了安全、透明的个性化适配，能够满足不同用户的独特需求，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Physical caregiving robots hold promise for improving the quality of life of
millions worldwide who require assistance with feeding. However, in-home meal
assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,
eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),
food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we
propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized
in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed
in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative
study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three
key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and
safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that
enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)
diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and
physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,
and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently
adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the
personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating
that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To
demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two
care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each
across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity
by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the
system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their
individual needs and preferences. Website: https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/feast

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM是一种新型多相机全方位物体SLAM系统，利用环绕视角相机配置在复杂户外场景中实现鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的地图构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法多依赖RGB-D或单目相机，存在视野窄、遮挡敏感和深度感知有限的问题，尤其在大型或户外环境中，导致物体建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 提出MCOO-SLAM系统，整合点特征和物体级地标，增强开放词汇语义，采用语义-几何-时间融合策略进行多视角物体关联，并设计全方位闭环模块实现视角不变的地点识别。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在真实场景中实现了精确定位和可扩展的物体级地图构建，对遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机配置和语义融合策略，显著提升了复杂户外场景下的SLAM性能，支持下游推理任务。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

*Lucas Schulze,Jan Peters,Oleg Arenz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理信息的上下文感知动态模型（DeLaN），结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与模型预测控制（MPC）集成，用于机器人自适应控制。实验表明，该方法显著降低了末端执行器的跟踪误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂环境中，机器人需要与大量不确定物理属性的对象交互，这使得使用单一全局模型变得不可行。因此，需要开发能够在线识别上下文并仅捕获当前相关环境特征的模型，同时保持物理合理性。

Method: 扩展了DeLaN模型，使其具备上下文感知能力，结合循环网络进行在线系统识别，并与MPC集成。此外，还结合了残差动力学模型以利用机器人名义模型的先验知识。

Result: 在7自由度机械臂的轨迹跟踪实验中，该方法将末端执行器的跟踪误差降低了39%，而基线方法（使用扩展卡尔曼滤波器）仅改善了21%。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的DeLaN模型结合在线系统识别和MPC，能够有效提升机器人在复杂环境中的自适应控制性能，显著减少跟踪误差。

Abstract: Controlling a robot based on physics-informed dynamic models, such as deep
Lagrangian networks (DeLaN), can improve the generalizability and
interpretability of the resulting behavior. However, in complex environments,
the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical
properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a
single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system
identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant
aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation
of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility
for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,
particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model
Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it
context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system
identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed
control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the
fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available. We evaluate our
method on a 7-DOF robot arm for trajectory tracking under varying loads. Our
method reduces the end-effector tracking error by 39%, compared to a 21%
improvement achieved by a baseline that uses an extended Kalman filter.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合粒子与空间网格的神经动力学框架，用于建模可变形物体的动态，并通过高斯溅射实现视觉渲染，在有限视角下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形物体的动态建模面临物理属性多样性和视觉信息有限的挑战，需要一种能同时捕捉全局形状与运动信息的方法。

Method: 采用粒子-网格混合表示：粒子编码物体形状，空间网格离散3D空间以确保连续性；结合高斯溅射进行视觉渲染，实现全学习式的数字孪生。

Result: 模型能从稀疏RGB-D数据学习绳索、布料等多样物体的动态，在有限视角下超越现有模拟器，并支持基于模型的物体操控任务规划。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体提供了高效的动态建模与渲染方案，在机器人交互等场景中展现出泛化能力和应用潜力。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page
