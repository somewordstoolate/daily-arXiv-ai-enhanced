### [1] [TeleEval-OS: Performance evaluations of large language models for operations scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11017)
*Yanyan Wang,Yingying Wang,Junli Liang,Yin Xu,Yunlong Liu,Yiming Xu,Zhengwang Jiang,Zhehe Li,Fei Li,Long Zhao,Kuang Xu,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出首个电信运营调度评估基准TeleEval-OS，通过15个数据集覆盖4个运营阶段，系统评估14个大语言模型在电信领域的应用潜力。实验表明开源模型在特定场景可超越闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电信运营调度任务具有领域专业性和复杂性，但缺乏全面评估基准，阻碍了大语言模型在该关键领域的应用潜力探索。

Method: 构建包含13个子任务/15个数据集的TeleEval-OS基准，模拟票务创建、处理、关闭及评估四阶段，采用零样本/少样本方法评估10个开源和4个闭源大语言模型。

Result: 实验表明开源模型(如DeepSeek-V3)在特定场景表现优于闭源模型(如GPT-4o)，验证了其在电信运营调度领域的应用价值。

Conclusion: TeleEval-OS填补了领域评估空白，证明开源大语言模型在电信运营调度中具有显著应用潜力，为后续研究提供基准支持。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in artificial intelligence, demonstrating substantial
application potential across multiple specialized domains. Telecommunications
operation scheduling (OS) is a critical aspect of the telecommunications
industry, involving the coordinated management of networks, services, risks,
and human resources to optimize production scheduling and ensure unified
service control. However, the inherent complexity and domain-specific nature of
OS tasks, coupled with the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, have
hindered thorough exploration of LLMs' application potential in this critical
field. To address this research gap, we propose the first Telecommunications
Operation Scheduling Evaluation Benchmark (TeleEval-OS). Specifically, this
benchmark comprises 15 datasets across 13 subtasks, comprehensively simulating
four key operational stages: intelligent ticket creation, intelligent ticket
handling, intelligent ticket closure, and intelligent evaluation. To
systematically assess the performance of LLMs on tasks of varying complexity,
we categorize their capabilities in telecommunications operation scheduling
into four hierarchical levels, arranged in ascending order of difficulty: basic
NLP, knowledge Q&A, report generation, and report analysis. On TeleEval-OS, we
leverage zero-shot and few-shot evaluation methods to comprehensively assess 10
open-source LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-V3) and 4 closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o)
across diverse scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that open-source
LLMs can outperform closed-source LLMs in specific scenarios, highlighting
their significant potential and value in the field of telecommunications
operation scheduling.

### [2] [Who is in the Spotlight: The Hidden Bias Undermining Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11063)
*Jiayu Yao,Shenghua Liu,Yiwei Wang,Lingrui Mei,Baolong Bi,Yuyao Ge,Zhecheng Li,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了多模态检索增强生成（RAG）中证据位置对性能的影响，发现其呈现U型准确率曲线，并提出位置敏感性指数（PSI_p）及注意力可视化框架，指出多模态交互会加剧位置偏差，需通过证据重排序或去偏策略提升系统可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG模型对证据顺序高度敏感，导致性能不稳定和推理偏差，尤其在检索项数量或模态多样性增加时更为突出。研究旨在揭示位置偏差对多模态RAG的影响机制。

Method: 通过文本、图像及混合模态任务的对照实验，量化位置敏感性指数（PSI_p），并开发注意力分配可视化框架，分析解码层注意力模式与位置偏差的关联。

Result: 实验表明：1）证据位置与准确率呈U型曲线关系；2）多模态交互较单模态加剧位置偏差；3）偏差随检索范围呈对数增长；4）解码层注意力分布可解释偏差形成机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态RAG中位置偏差的规律与成因，为位置感知分析提供理论依据，强调需通过证据重排序或去偏策略构建更可靠、公平的生成系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become essential
in knowledge-intensive and open-domain tasks. As retrieval complexity
increases, ensuring the robustness of these systems is critical. However,
current RAG models are highly sensitive to the order in which evidence is
presented, often resulting in unstable performance and biased reasoning,
particularly as the number of retrieved items or modality diversity grows. This
raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect
multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive
study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled
experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe
a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To
quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and
develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across
decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify
position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases
logarithmically with retrieval range. These findings offer both theoretical and
empirical foundations for position-aware analysis in RAG, highlighting the need
for evidence reordering or debiasing strategies to build more reliable and
equitable generation systems.

*Alexey Tikhonov,Sergei Shteiner,Anna Bykova,Ivan P. Yamshchikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文利用现代大语言模型（LLMs）分析历史皮钦语Russenorsk的词汇与结构，构建词典并验证假设，开发翻译代理以生成现代文本的拟构译文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Russenorsk作为俄挪贸易中形成的独特皮钦语，其语言机制尚未被充分解析。研究旨在通过LLMs结合文献，探索其构词与语法核心原则，并补充传统学术方法。

Method: 基于现存语料构建结构化词典（按同义词、词源分组），利用LLMs生成构词与语法假设，对比既有学术理论，并开发翻译代理进行拟构翻译。

Result: 成功建立Russenorsk词典，验证LLMs生成假设与文献理论的部分一致性，且翻译代理能生成符合语言特征的拟构文本。

Conclusion: LLMs为历史语言分析提供新工具，可辅助验证假设并扩展研究边界，同时揭示Russenorsk的混合语言特征，推动跨学科方法在语言学中的应用。

Abstract: Russenorsk, a pidgin language historically used in trade interactions between
Russian and Norwegian speakers, represents a unique linguistic phenomenon. In
this paper, we attempt to analyze its lexicon using modern large language
models (LLMs), based on surviving literary sources. We construct a structured
dictionary of the language, grouped by synonyms and word origins. Subsequently,
we use this dictionary to formulate hypotheses about the core principles of
word formation and grammatical structure in Russenorsk and show which
hypotheses generated by large language models correspond to the hypotheses
previously proposed ones in the academic literature. We also develop a
"reconstruction" translation agent that generates hypothetical Russenorsk
renderings of contemporary Russian and Norwegian texts.

*Hieu Nghiem,Hemanth Reddy Singareddy,Zhuqi Miao,Jivan Lamichhane,Abdulaziz Ahmed,Johnson Thomas,Dursun Delen,William Paiva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发基于开源大语言模型的自动化流程，从临床笔记中提取系统回顾实体，降低文档负担，ChatGPT表现最佳，开源模型在资源有限环境中可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床笔记中系统回顾（ROS）实体提取的高成本和可扩展性问题，为资源有限的医疗机构提供本地化、经济高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用SecTag提取ROS段落，结合少样本提示的开源LLMs（Mistral/Llama/Gemma）和ChatGPT识别实体范围、状态及关联系统，基于36份含341个标注实体的临床笔记评估。

Result: 整合ChatGPT时实体范围识别错误率最低（28.2%），状态/系统错误率14.5%；开源模型实体范围错误率30.5-36.7%，状态/系统错误率24.3-27.3%。

Conclusion: 该流程兼具可扩展性与本地部署优势，开源LLMs可作为商业模型替代方案，适用于资源受限的医疗场景。

Abstract: Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based
pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from
clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using
SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their
positive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the
pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The
evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated
ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the
lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding
statuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable
local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising
performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:
24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and
locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source
LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited
healthcare environments.

### [5] [Deontological Keyword Bias: The Impact of Modal Expressions on Normative Judgments of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11068)
*Bumjin Park,Jinsil Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在道德判断中存在义务论关键词偏见（DKB），即当提示包含‘必须’或‘应当’等模态表达时，模型倾向于将非义务情境误判为义务。提出结合示例与推理提示的缓解此偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐研究较少关注模型在义务判断中的偏差，尤其是模态表达对判断的影响。此类偏差可能导致模型与人类伦理标准不一致，需探索其机制及缓解方法。

Method: 通过分析不同模态表达对LLM判断的影响，提出DKB概念，并设计实验验证其普遍性。进一步提出结合少量示例（few-shot）与推理提示的综合策略以缓解偏见。

Result: 实验表明，当提示含模态词时，LLM在超90%的常识场景中误判非义务为义务，且此现象跨模型、问题及回答格式一致。提出的缓解策略有效降低了DKB影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模态表达作为语言框架对LLM规范性决策的显著影响，强调解决此类偏见的必要性，以确保模型判断与人类伦理标准对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly engaging in moral and ethical
reasoning, where criteria for judgment are often unclear, even for humans.
While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored
area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong
tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts
are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce
this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge
over 90\% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are
present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types,
and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that
integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on
how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative
decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to
ensure judgment alignment.

### [6] [Targeted control of fast prototyping through domain-specific interface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11070)
*Yu-Zhe Shi,Mingchen Liu,Hanlu Ma,Qiao Xu,Huamin Qu,Kun He,Lecheng Ruan,Qining Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种接口架构作为大语言模型与建模语言间的媒介，解决抽象层次、语义精度及词汇范围差异，实现通过自然语言精准控制原型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设计师需通过自然语言指令直接控制原型模型，但大语言模型因设计语言与建模语言间的抽象层级不匹配、语义波动及词汇范围差异，未能充分发挥潜力。

Method: 基于快速原型设计实践原则，开发接口操作机制及自动领域规范算法，构建连接自然语言与建模语言的中间层架构。

Result: 跨领域原型设计实验表明，该接口可作为大语言模型辅助模块，显著提升模型控制的精确性与有效性。

Conclusion: 所提接口有效弥合人机语言鸿沟，使大语言模型能更自然地辅助设计师实现意图驱动的原型迭代。

Abstract: Industrial designers have long sought a natural and intuitive way to achieve
the targeted control of prototype models -- using simple natural language
instructions to configure and adjust the models seamlessly according to their
intentions, without relying on complex modeling commands. While Large Language
Models have shown promise in this area, their potential for controlling
prototype models through language remains partially underutilized. This
limitation stems from gaps between designers' languages and modeling languages,
including mismatch in abstraction levels, fluctuation in semantic precision,
and divergence in lexical scopes. To bridge these gaps, we propose an interface
architecture that serves as a medium between the two languages. Grounded in
design principles derived from a systematic investigation of fast prototyping
practices, we devise the interface's operational mechanism and develop an
algorithm for its automated domain specification. Both machine-based
evaluations and human studies on fast prototyping across various product design
domains demonstrate the interface's potential to function as an auxiliary
module for Large Language Models, enabling precise and effective targeted
control of prototype models.

### [7] [CLAIM: Mitigating Multilingual Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11073)
*Zekai Ye,Qiming Li,Xiaocheng Feng,Libo Qin,Yichong Huang,Baohang Li,Kui Jiang,Yang Xiang,Zhirui Zhang,Yunfei Lu,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Bing Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CLAIM方法，通过跨语言注意力干预，无需大量训练即可缓解大型视觉语言模型在多语言场景下的对象幻觉问题，实验显示显著提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决多语言对象幻觉的方法依赖资源密集的预训练或微调，且观察到不同语言的跨模态注意力模式存在显著差异，需开发轻量化解决方案。

Method: CLAIM通过三步实现：1)识别语言相关的跨模态注意力头；2)估计英语到目标语言的注意力偏移向量；3)在推理时干预注意力输出以对齐跨语言视觉感知能力。

Result: 在POPE和MME基准测试中分别实现13.56%和西班牙语最高30%）及21.75%的平均提升，分析表明中间层的注意力差异在多语言场景中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 跨语言注意力干预有效缓解多语言对象幻觉，中间层注意力对齐是提升模型多语言鲁棒性的核心机制，为轻量化解决方案提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal
abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher
likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when
utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing
approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are
resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in
cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual
Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM)
in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns.
CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then
estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and
finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate
cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in
Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME
benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual
attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting
their critical role in multilingual scenarios.

### [8] [CyclicReflex: Improving Large Reasoning Models via Cyclical Reflection Token Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11077)
*Chongyu Fan,Yihua Zhang,Jinghan Jia,Alfred Hero,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出CyclicReflex方法，通过动态调节反思令牌的频率和位置，提升大型推理模型在测试时的计算性能，实验表明该方法在不同规模模型上均优于现有解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中依赖反思令牌引导自我评估，但反思令牌的过量（过反思）或不足（欠反思）均会导致性能下降。需探索如何优化这一资源分配问题。

Method: 将反思令牌分配类比为优化中的学习率调度，提出基于位置相关三角波形的解码策略CyclicReflex，动态调整反思令牌的logits以平衡其使用。

Result: 在MATH500、AIME2024/2025和AMC2023等数据集上，CyclicReflex在1.5B-8B规模模型中均稳定提升性能，优于标准解码及TIP、S1等最新方法。

Conclusion: 反思令牌的分配需动态调控，CyclicReflex通过周期性调度策略有效平衡过反思与欠反思问题，为LRMs的测试时计算资源优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, harness
test-time scaling to perform multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
This reasoning process, executed before producing final answers, is often
guided by special juncture tokens or textual segments that prompt
self-evaluative reflection. We refer to these transition markers and reflective
cues as "reflection tokens" (e.g., "wait", "but", "alternatively"). In this
work, we treat reflection tokens as a "resource" and introduce the problem of
resource allocation, aimed at improving the test-time compute performance of
LRMs by adaptively regulating the frequency and placement of reflection tokens.
Through empirical analysis, we show that both excessive and insufficient use of
reflection tokens, referred to as over-reflection and under-reflection, can
degrade model performance. To better understand and manage this trade-off, we
draw an analogy between reflection token usage and learning rate scheduling in
optimization. Building on this insight, we propose cyclical reflection token
scheduling (termed CyclicReflex), a decoding strategy that dynamically
modulates reflection token logits using a position-dependent triangular
waveform. Experiments on MATH500, AIME2024/2025, and AMC2023 demonstrate that
CyclicReflex consistently improves performance across model sizes (1.5B-8B),
outperforming standard decoding and more recent approaches such as TIP (thought
switching penalty) and S1. Codes are available at
https://github.com/OPTML-Group/CyclicReflex.

### [9] [RoE-FND: A Case-Based Reasoning Approach with Dual Verification for Fake News Detection via LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11078)
*Yuzhou Yang,Yangming Zhou,Zhiying Zhu,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RoE-FND框架，通过结合大语言模型与经验学习，将证据型假新闻检测重构为逻辑推理任务，解决噪声证据、泛化瓶颈与决策不透明问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有证据检测方法存在噪声证据选择、泛化能力受限及决策过程不透明等缺陷，而大语言模型的应用又面临幻觉推理与结论偏差问题，需系统性解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 探索阶段通过分析历史错误构建自省知识库；2) 部署阶段动态合成任务推理准则，并设计双通道机制交叉验证内部经验与外部依据。

Result: 在三个数据集上验证框架有效性，相比SOTA方法展现出更强的泛化能力，且无需训练即可适应动态场景。

Conclusion: RoE-FND通过案例推理机制解决了多维度挑战，其无训练适应特性与可解释决策过程为假新闻检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: The proliferation of deceptive content online necessitates robust Fake News
Detection (FND) systems. While evidence-based approaches leverage external
knowledge to verify claims, existing methods face critical limitations: noisy
evidence selection, generalization bottlenecks, and unclear decision-making
processes. Recent efforts to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) for FND
introduce new challenges, including hallucinated rationales and conclusion
bias. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RoE-FND}
(\textbf{\underline{R}}eason \textbf{\underline{o}}n
\textbf{\underline{E}}xperiences FND), a framework that reframes evidence-based
FND as a logical deduction task by synergizing LLMs with experiential learning.
RoE-FND encompasses two stages: (1) \textit{self-reflective knowledge
building}, where a knowledge base is curated by analyzing past reasoning
errors, namely the exploration stage, and (2) \textit{dynamic criterion
retrieval}, which synthesizes task-specific reasoning guidelines from
historical cases as experiences during deployment. It further cross-checks
rationales against internal experience through a devised dual-channel
procedure. Key contributions include: a case-based reasoning framework for FND
that addresses multiple existing challenges, a training-free approach enabling
adaptation to evolving situations, and empirical validation of the framework's
superior generalization and effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods across
three datasets.

*Han Zhou,Qitong Xu,Yiheng Dong,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出双语基准MANBench，评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类在多模态任务中的表现差异。结果显示，MLLMs在跨模态推理等复杂任务上仍落后于人类，且双方在极高复杂度任务中均面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MLLMs是否能在多模态任务中超越人类表现的争议，需建立更全面的评估框架以量化模型与人类能力的差距，并揭示模型局限性。

Method: 构建MANBench双语基准（含1314个问题），覆盖知识型与非知识型9类任务，强调直观推理、跨模态整合及现实复杂性，并通过多样化人类实验对比MLLMs表现。

Result: MLLMs在知识/图文理解任务中表现优异，但在跨模态推理（如变形理解、图像一致性）上显著落后人类；人类与模型在谜题/空间想象等高复杂度任务中均存在困难。

Conclusion: MANBench揭示了MLLMs尚未达到人类水平的多模态能力，尤其在深层推理任务中。该基准旨在推动缩小模型与人类能力差距的研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has ignited
discussions regarding their potential to surpass human performance in
multimodal tasks. In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms
Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314
questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based
domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal
integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation
framework.
  Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we
compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate
that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding,
they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic
Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both
humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and
Spatial Imagination.
  MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that
even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across
many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between
MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/micdz/MANBench.

*Aditi,Hyunwoo Park,Sicheol Sung,Yo-Sub Han,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SAGE方法，利用开源大语言模型和强化学习从自然语言规范中生成带计数器的上下文无关文法(CCFG)，在语法有效性和测试效果上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语法的测试用例生成方法面临从自然语言规范生成有效且通用文法的挑战，尤其在有限监督条件下。带计数器的上下文无关文法(CCFG)虽能表达逻辑约束，但自动生成仍存在困难。

Method: 1. 微调开源LLM实现规范到CCFG的转换 2. 使用可验证奖励引导的GRPO强化学习优化语法有效性 3. 研究迭代反馈对开源/闭源LLM的语法纠错效果

Result: SAGE方法在语法有效性(提升15.92%)和测试效果(提升12.34%)上超越17个开源/闭源LLM，在语法通用性方面实现当前最佳表现。

Conclusion: 结合监督微调与强化学习的混合方法能有效提升文法生成质量，验证了可验证奖励机制和迭代反馈对LLM生成逻辑约束文法的有效性。

Abstract: Grammar-based test case generation has proven effective for competitive
programming problems, but generating valid and general grammars from natural
language specifications remains a key challenge, especially under limited
supervision. Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs) have recently been
introduced as a formalism to represent such specifications with logical
constraints by storing and reusing counter values during derivation. In this
work, we explore the use of open-source large language models (LLMs) to induce
CCFGs from specifications using a small number of labeled examples and
verifiable reward-guided reinforcement learning. Our approach first fine-tunes
an open-source LLM to perform specification-to-grammar translation, and further
applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance grammar validity
and generality. We also examine the effectiveness of iterative feedback for
open and closed-source LLMs in correcting syntactic and semantic errors in
generated grammars.
  Experimental results show that our approach SAGE achieves stronger
generalization and outperforms 17 open and closed-source LLMs in both grammar
quality and test effectiveness, improving over the state-of-the-art by 15.92%p
in grammar validity and 12.34%p in test effectiveness. We provide our
implementation and dataset at the following anonymous
repository:https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SAGE-5714

*Lionel Levine,John Santerre,Alex S. Young,T. Barry Levine,Francis Campion,Majid Sarrafzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一种基于Transformer的架构，通过将临床轨迹建模为事件序列，预测诊断过程中的下一步骤，显著优于基线模型，展示了生成模型在医疗序列数据中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统临床决策模型依赖孤立诊断分类，无法捕捉诊断过程的时序依赖性。PRISM旨在通过序列建模模拟真实临床决策路径，解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用自回归训练目标和定制临床词汇表，将诊断测试、实验室结果等事件序列标记化，通过Transformer架构学习患者时间线中的复杂依赖关系。

Result: 在下一标记预测任务中显著超越随机基线，生成序列能反映真实诊断路径、实验室结果演变及医生行为模式。

Conclusion: PRISM验证了生成式语言模型在结构化医疗事件数据中的可行性，为临床决策支持、模拟教育及序列化医疗建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Predictive Reasoning in Sequential Medicine), a
transformer-based architecture designed to model the sequential progression of
clinical decision-making processes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
isolated diagnostic classification, PRISM frames clinical trajectories as
tokenized sequences of events - including diagnostic tests, laboratory results,
and diagnoses - and learns to predict the most probable next steps in the
patient diagnostic journey. Leveraging a large custom clinical vocabulary and
an autoregressive training objective, PRISM demonstrates the ability to capture
complex dependencies across longitudinal patient timelines. Experimental
results show substantial improvements over random baselines in next-token
prediction tasks, with generated sequences reflecting realistic diagnostic
pathways, laboratory result progressions, and clinician ordering behaviors.
These findings highlight the feasibility of applying generative language

### [13] [RedDebate: Safer Responses through Multi-Agent Red Teaming Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11083)
*Ali Asad,Stephen Obadinma,Radin Shayanfar,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RedDebate提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，通过LLMs之间的对抗性论证自动识别和减少不安全行为，结合长期记忆模块提升AI安全性，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法依赖人工评估或单模型评估，存在扩展性限制和监管风险，需更自动化的解决方案。

Method: 利用多智能体辩论框架，通过对抗性论证和红队测试系统性发现模型的安全盲点，并集成长期记忆模块保留安全洞见。

Result: 在HarmBench等基准测试中，辩论使不安全行为减少17.7%，结合记忆模块后减少超过23.5%。

Conclusion: RedDebate是首个全自动结合多智能体辩论与红队测试的框架，显著提升AI安全性且无需直接人工干预。

Abstract: We propose RedDebate, a novel multi-agent debate framework that leverages
adversarial argumentation among Large Language Models (LLMs) to proactively
identify and mitigate their own unsafe behaviours. Existing AI safety methods
often depend heavily on costly human evaluations or isolated single-model
assessment, both subject to scalability constraints and oversight risks.
RedDebate instead embraces collaborative disagreement, enabling multiple LLMs
to critically examine one another's reasoning, and systematically uncovering
unsafe blind spots through automated red-teaming, and iteratively improve their
responses. We further integrate distinct types of long-term memory that retain
learned safety insights from debate interactions. Evaluating on established
safety benchmarks such as HarmBench, we demonstrate the proposed method's
effectiveness. Debate alone can reduce unsafe behaviours by 17.7%, and when
combined with long-term memory modules, achieves reductions exceeding 23.5%. To
our knowledge, RedDebate constitutes the first fully automated framework that
combines multi-agent debates with red-teaming to progressively enhance AI
safety without direct human intervention.(Github Repository:

*Pengbo Wang,Chaozhuo Li,Chenxu Wang,Liwen Zheng,Litian Zhang,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SPACE框架，通过编辑共享激活子空间联合缓解LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法独立处理LLMs的事实性和忠实性幻觉时存在性能权衡，研究发现两者在神经表征中存在重叠子空间，为共同缓解提供可能。

Method: SPACE框架结合双任务特征建模建立共享子空间基础，通过谱聚类和注意力头显著性评分的混合探针策略识别并编辑子空间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能同时提升模型的事实性和忠实性，效果优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 通过共享子空间编辑实现双幻觉联合缓解，为LLMs的可靠性优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in natural language
processing, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by persistent
factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. While existing methods address
these hallucination types independently, they inadvertently induce performance
trade-offs, as interventions targeting one type often exacerbate the other.
Through empirical and theoretical analysis of activation space dynamics in
LLMs, we reveal that these hallucination categories share overlapping subspaces
within neural representations, presenting an opportunity for concurrent
mitigation. To harness this insight, we propose SPACE, a unified framework that
jointly enhances factuality and faithfulness by editing shared activation
subspaces. SPACE establishes a geometric foundation for shared subspace
existence through dual-task feature modeling, then identifies and edits these
subspaces via a hybrid probe strategy combining spectral clustering and
attention head saliency scoring. Experimental results across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

*Shaoshi Ling,Guoli Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的无监督领域适应方法，利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为奖励模型，通过未标注数据反馈优化ASR模型，显著提升领域不匹配场景下的命名实体识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR系统在罕见命名实体识别和跨领域适应上表现不足，而LLM因广泛训练数据具备更强的跨领域能力。研究旨在结合LLM反馈优化ASR模型，解决领域不匹配问题。

Method: 构建强化学习框架：以LLM为奖励模型，根据上下文对ASR生成假设进行评分，生成奖励信号，通过强化学习微调ASR模型。

Result: 实体词错误率较传统自训练方法降低21%，验证了LLM反馈对ASR领域适应性的提升效果。

Conclusion: 结合LLM反馈的强化学习方法有效提升ASR在领域不匹配场景下的性能，尤其在命名实体识别任务中表现显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved strong performance
on general transcription tasks. However, they continue to struggle with
recognizing rare named entities and adapting to domain mismatches. In contrast,
large language models (LLMs), trained on massive internet-scale datasets, are
often more effective across a wide range of domains. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning based approach for unsupervised domain adaptation,
leveraging unlabeled data to enhance transcription quality, particularly the
named entities affected by domain mismatch, through feedback from a LLM. Given
contextual information, our framework employs a LLM as the reward model to
score the hypotheses from the ASR model. These scores serve as reward signals
to fine-tune the ASR model via reinforcement learning. Our method achieves a
21\% improvement on entity word error rate over conventional self-training
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍动态上下文调整（DCT）框架，通过轻量级设计扩展RAG系统，支持多轮对话与动态工具选择，显著提升任务准确率并降低幻觉生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统局限于静态单轮交互与固定工具集，难以适应医疗、智能家居等动态领域的需求。需解决用户意图、工具可用性及上下文动态演变的问题。

Method: DCT框架集成注意力上下文缓存追踪历史信息，基于LoRA的动态领域工具检索，以及高效上下文压缩技术，无需模型重训练即可适配动态环境。

Result: 实验显示DCT使规划准确率提升14%，幻觉减少37%，以更低成本达到GPT-4性能水平，并能泛化至未见过的新工具。

Conclusion: DCT通过轻量级架构实现动态环境下的持续适应能力，为可扩展AI助手在复杂场景中的应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large
language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and
knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to
static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited
for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent,
available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic
Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support
multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring
retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant
past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific
tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context
limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT
improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching
GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to
previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a
wide range of dynamic environments.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the field of
Natural Language Processing (NLP), including areas such as content generation,
human-computer interaction, machine translation, and code generation, among
others. However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety
concerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited
unsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,
which has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While
numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with
LLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research
endeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview
of recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key
aspects: (1) "Why evaluate" that explores the background of LLMs safety
evaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance
of such evaluation; (2) "What to evaluate" that examines and categorizes
existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including
dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,
truthfulness, and so on; (3) "Where to evaluate" that summarizes the evaluation
metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) "How
to evaluate" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing
mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we
identify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential
research directions to promote further advancement in this field. We emphasize
the importance of prioritizing LLMs safety evaluation to ensure the safe
deployment of these models in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息缺口理论的新框架，通过分析文本语义结构的拓扑变化来量化读者好奇心，实验证明该方法能显著提升预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 读者好奇心是文本参与度的关键驱动因素，但在自然语言处理领域尚未被充分探索。现有研究缺乏对文本内部信息缺口与好奇心关系的量化分析。

Method: 结合BERTopic主题建模与持续同调技术，构建动态语义网络并分析其拓扑特征(连通分支/循环/空洞)，将拓扑特征作为信息缺口的代理变量。

Result: 使用《饥饿游戏》读者评分数据验证，拓扑特征模型解释偏差达73%(基线30%)，显著提升好奇心预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析文本结构与读者参与度的关系提供了新的计算范式，验证了拓扑特征在量化信息缺口方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reader curiosity, the drive to seek information, is crucial for textual
engagement, yet remains relatively underexplored in NLP. Building on
Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models
reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's
semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and
persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components,
cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments,
treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically
evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants
(n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the
topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict
these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve
curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained
deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational
method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement.

### [19] [C-SEO Bench: Does Conversational SEO Work?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11097)
*Haritz Puerto,Martin Gubri,Tommaso Green,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出首个评估对话式搜索引擎优化（C-SEO）方法的基准C-SEO Bench，发现现有C-SEO方法效果有限，传统SEO策略更有效，且多参与者竞争采用时收益递减，问题呈现零和性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C-SEO方法仅在有限领域测试，且评估仅考虑单一参与者场景，而实际中可能存在多参与者竞争性采用C-SEO技术，需系统性评估其广泛适用性及多参与者影响。

Method: 构建C-SEO Bench基准，涵盖问答和产品推荐两类任务（各含三个领域），并设计支持不同参与者采用率的评估协议，验证方法在多任务、多领域及多竞争场景下的效果。

Result: 实验表明当前C-SEO方法普遍低效，传统SEO策略（如提升LLM上下文中的来源排名）更有效；且随着C-SEO采用者增加，整体收益下降，问题呈现拥堵和零和特性。

Conclusion: C-SEO问题具有竞争性和零和性，传统SEO策略在对话式搜索中仍占优，需重新审视现有C-SEO方法的设计方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming search engines into
Conversational Search Engines (CSE). Consequently, Search Engine Optimization
(SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).
We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to
increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only
for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether
certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains.
Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only
one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely
to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy
from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains,
and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and
product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new
evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our
experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective,
contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO
strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM
context, are significantly more effective. We also observe that as we increase
the number of C-SEO adopters, the overall gains decrease, depicting a congested
and zero-sum nature of the problem. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出一个系统分析框架，从进化视角区分AI代理与LLM聊天机器人，明确五方面差异，分类现有评估基准，并通过环境、代理、评估者、指标四维度指导未来评估方法，为研究者选择合适评测基准提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架常混淆LLM聊天机器人与AI代理的差异，导致研究者选择评测基准时存在困惑，阻碍该领域进一步发展。需通过系统分析明确两者区别，建立清晰的评估体系。

Method: 基于进化视角构建分析框架，从复杂环境、多源指令、动态反馈、多模态感知、高阶能力五方面区分AI代理与LLM聊天机器人；按外部驱动因素和内部能力分类现有评测基准，并提炼四维评估视角（环境-代理-评估者-指标）。

Result: 提出包含差异化维度的分析框架，形成可实践的基准分类表；总结当前趋势并构建四维未来评估方法论，为不同研究需求提供具体评测属性选择指引。

Conclusion: 通过系统性差异分析与基准分类，本文为AI代理评估提供可操作的框架与方法论，促进研究者合理选择评测工具，推动智能代理领域持续演进。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Gemini, and
DeepSeek, has significantly advanced natural language processing, giving rise
to sophisticated chatbots capable of diverse language-related tasks. The
transition from these traditional LLM chatbots to more advanced AI agents
represents a pivotal evolutionary step. However, existing evaluation frameworks
often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to
confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this
gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation
approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed
analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots
along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic
feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we
categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments
driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each
category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented
comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current
trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical
lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer
actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and
application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued
advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.

*Wenchong He,Liqian Peng,Zhe Jiang,Alex Go*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL)方法，通过将上下文示例的每个答案作为监督训练目标，显著缩小了上下文学习与专用微调的性能差距，并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本上下文微调方法（如Mistral 7B）虽能同时处理多任务，但其性能仍落后于单任务专用微调，且长序列处理效率低下。

Method: 提出ManyICL框架，将传统仅预测最终答案的目标扩展为对上下文内所有答案进行监督训练，使多样本示例从提示转变为自回归学习目标。

Result: 在分类、摘要、问答等任务中，ManyICL超越零/少样本微调，接近专用微调性能，并显著减少灾难性遗忘现象。

Conclusion: ManyICL通过重新定义上下文学习范式，有效提升多任务处理效率与性能，为LLMs的通用微调提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform
in-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream
tasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent
studies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma
7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of
all tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated
fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning
(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the
principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of
ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with
numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of
solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the
context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of
many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through
extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,
summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we
demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning
and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in
zero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态稀疏注意力机制DAM，通过自适应掩码保留异质性注意力模式，解决传统方法因静态掩码导致的效率与性能问题，在降低计算开销的同时保持与全注意力模型的高对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer因自注意力二次复杂度导致长文本处理效率低下，而现有稀疏注意力方法使用静态预定义掩码，无法捕捉异质性模式，导致次优的token交互和检索性能下降。

Method: 提出动态稀疏注意力机制，在注意力图层面分配自适应掩码，无需微调或预定义结构，通过上下文感知学习保持各层/头的异质性模式，兼顾计算效率。

Result: DAM在减少内存与计算开销的同时，与全注意力模型高度对齐，性能损失最小，显著提升长序列任务的适应性和检索准确性。

Conclusion: DAM为大规模语言模型提供可扩展的高效注意力方案，无需牺牲性能即可实现实际部署，平衡了效率与长上下文建模能力。

Abstract: Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet
transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of
self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose
static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns.
This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and
retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic
sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map
level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike
existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and
predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By
learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with
full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing
memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to
full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language
Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance. DAM is available at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗场景潜力巨大，但模型体积过大难以在边缘设备实时部署，需针对专业领域进行轻量化优化。

Method: 基于领域数据测量神经元显著性进行激进剪枝，结合训练后量化压缩内存占用，并在Jetson/Raspberry Pi硬件部署验证。

Result: Gemma压缩50%、LLaMA3压缩67%后，在18.7W的Jetson和6.3W的树莓派5上实现实时推理，医疗基准测试性能保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该压缩框架有效平衡模型规模与性能，为LLMs在医疗边缘计算场景的实用化部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant impact on the healthcare
scenarios but remain prohibitively large for deployment in real-time,
resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. In this work, we
introduce a novel medical assistant system, optimized through our
general-purpose compression framework, which tailors Large Language Models
(LLMs) for deployment in specialized domains. By measuring neuron saliency on
domain-specific data, our method can aggressively prune irrelevant neurons,
reducing model size while preserving performance. Following pruning, we apply
post-training quantization to further reduce the memory footprint, and evaluate
the compressed model across medical benchmarks including MedMCQA, MedQA, and
PubMedQA. We also deploy the 50\% compressed Gemma and the 67\% compressed
LLaMA3 models on Jetson Orin Nano (18.7W peak) and Raspberry Pi 5 (6.3W peak),
achieving real-time, energy-efficient inference under hardware constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有基于知识图谱的RAG方法因仅依赖实体提取导致信息遗漏和检索偏差，本文提出PankRAG框架，通过分层查询解析和依赖感知重排序机制，在多个基准测试中超越SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图谱RAG方法过度依赖实体级信息提取，容易忽略潜在语义关系和层级依赖，导致检索结果不相关或矛盾，加剧大模型幻觉风险并降低生成质量。

Method: PankRAG框架包含：1) 全局感知的分层查询解析路径，捕捉查询的并行/时序依赖关系；2) 依赖感知重排序机制，利用子问题依赖结构验证和增强检索结果。

Result: 实验表明PankRAG在多个基准测试中持续优于现有方法，验证了其通过结构化推理和依赖感知机制提升检索质量的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过分层解析和依赖感知的联合优化，PankRAG有效解决了传统RAG的语义断层问题，显著提升生成结果的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Contemporary graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
typically begin by extracting entities from user queries and then leverage
pre-constructed knowledge graphs to retrieve related relationships and
metadata. However, this pipeline's exclusive reliance on entity-level
extraction can lead to the misinterpretation or omission of latent yet critical
information and relations. As a result, retrieved content may be irrelevant or
contradictory, and essential knowledge may be excluded, exacerbating
hallucination risks and degrading the fidelity of generated responses. To
address these limitations, we introduce PankRAG, a framework that combines a
globally aware, hierarchical query-resolution strategy with a novel
dependency-aware reranking mechanism. PankRAG first constructs a multi-level
resolution path that captures both parallel and sequential interdependencies
within a query, guiding large language models (LLMs) through structured
reasoning. It then applies its dependency-aware reranker to exploit the
dependency structure among resolved sub-questions, enriching and validating
retrieval results for subsequent sub-questions. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that PankRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
across multiple benchmarks, underscoring its robustness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单轮对话模型无法有效处理多轮对话历史与复杂推理链，需在高效推理框架(vLLM)基础上扩展注意力引导机制，并解决长期上下文注意力分配问题。

Method: 1. 改造vLLM底层C++/CUDA内核实现异步逐层/逐头捕捉交叉注意力权重
2. 泛化自监督奖励函数以累积对话历史与推理步骤的注意力信号
3. 引入基于熵的约束机制防止早期上下文注意力塌缩

Result: 构建了支持多轮对话与思维链推理的增强框架，通过注意力信号累积与约束机制平衡长程依赖处理效果，并探讨了系统在多方对话与层次化推理场景的扩展潜力。

Conclusion: CAGSR-vLLM-MTC成功将自监督注意力引导机制扩展至复杂交互场景，未来可向多方参与对话和分层推理结构方向深化。

Abstract: We present CAGSR-vLLM-MTC, an extension of our Self-Supervised
Cross-Attention-Guided Reinforcement (CAGSR) framework, now implemented on the
high-performance vLLM runtime, to address both multi-turn dialogue and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Building upon our original single-turn approach, we
first instrumented vLLM's C++/CUDA kernels to asynchronously capture per-layer,
per-head cross-attention weights during generation. We then generalized our
self-supervised reward function to accumulate attention signals over entire
conversation histories and intermediate chain-of-thought steps. We discuss
practical trade-offs, including an entropy-based clamping mechanism to prevent
attention collapse on early context, and outline future directions for
multi-party dialogues and hierarchical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLMs）的移动分析方法存在两个缺陷：位置语义表示不足（仅使用离散ID）与移动信号建模不充分（单一模板指令微调）。

Method: QT-Mob框架包含两个核心模块：1) 学习紧凑语义化位置标记的编码模块；2) 多互补微调目标，对齐LLM内部表征以理解移动序列与位置语义。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，QT-Mob在下一位置预测与移动轨迹恢复任务中均超越现有深度学习和LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: QT-Mob通过语义化位置表征与多目标对齐策略，为LLM处理移动数据提供了通用且可解释的增强框架。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of location-based services has led to the generation
of vast amounts of mobility data, providing significant opportunities to model
user movement dynamics within urban environments. Recent advancements have
focused on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for mobility analytics.
However, existing methods face two primary limitations: inadequate semantic
representation of locations (i.e., discrete IDs) and insufficient modeling of
mobility signals within LLMs (i.e., single templated instruction fine-tuning).
To address these issues, we propose QT-Mob, a novel framework that
significantly enhances LLMs for mobility analytics. QT-Mob introduces a
location tokenization module that learns compact, semantically rich tokens to
represent locations, preserving contextual information while ensuring
compatibility with LLMs. Furthermore, QT-Mob incorporates a series of
complementary fine-tuning objectives that align the learned tokens with the
internal representations in LLMs, improving the model's comprehension of
sequential movement patterns and location semantics. The proposed QT-Mob
framework not only enhances LLMs' ability to interpret mobility data but also
provides a more generalizable approach for various mobility analytics tasks.
Experiments on three real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance in
both next-location prediction and mobility recovery tasks, outperforming
existing deep learning and LLM-based methods.

### [27] [AssertBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Self-Assertion in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11110)
*Jaeho Lee,Atharv Chowdhary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AssertBench是一个新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在面对用户对同一事实的正反表述时，能否坚持自身真实性判断而非盲目迎合用户。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注LLM的事实一致性与修辞鲁棒性，但未探索用户对事实的方向性表述（如声称正确/错误）如何影响模型判断。这种场景常见于实际使用，需评估模型是否因用户断言而改变立场。

Method: 从事实验证数据集FEVEROUS中采样证据支持的事实，为每个事实构建两种对立提示：用户声称正确/错误。记录模型同意度与推理过程，并通过分层结果（基于模型在中立提示下的准确性）分离框架效应与知识缺陷的影响。

Result: 该基准通过测量模型在矛盾用户断言下的判断稳定性，量化LLM『坚持己见』的能力。源代码已开源，支持后续研究。

Conclusion: AssertBench为评估LLM在对抗性场景中的真实性坚持能力提供了新工具，强调模型应基于事实而非用户表述方向做出稳定判断。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks have probed factual consistency and rhetorical robustness
in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how
directional framing of factually true statements influences model agreement, a
common scenario for LLM users. AssertBench addresses this by sampling
evidence-supported facts from FEVEROUS, a fact verification dataset. For each
(evidence-backed) fact, we construct two framing prompts: one where the user
claims the statement is factually correct, and another where the user claims it
is incorrect. We then record the model's agreement and reasoning. The desired
outcome is that the model asserts itself, maintaining consistent truth
evaluation across both framings, rather than switching its evaluation to agree
with the user. AssertBench isolates framing-induced variability from the
model's underlying factual knowledge by stratifying results based on the
model's accuracy on the same claims when presented neutrally. In doing so, this
benchmark aims to measure an LLM's ability to "stick to its guns" when
presented with contradictory user assertions about the same fact. The complete
source code is available at https://github.com/achowd32/assert-bench.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained enormous attention in recent years
due to their capability of understanding and generating natural languages. With
the rapid development and wild-range applications (e.g., Agents, Embodied
Intelligence), the robustness of LLMs has received increased attention. As the
core brain of many AI applications, the robustness of LLMs requires that models
should not only generate consistent contents, but also ensure the correctness
and stability of generated content when dealing with unexpeted application
scenarios (e.g., toxic prompts, limited noise domain data, outof-distribution
(OOD) applications, etc). In this survey paper, we conduct a thorough review of
the robustness of LLMs, aiming to provide a comprehensive terminology of
concepts and methods around this field and facilitate the community.
Specifically, we first give a formal definition of LLM robustness and present
the collection protocol of this survey paper. Then, based on the types of
perturbated inputs, we organize this survey from the following perspectives: 1)
Adversarial Robustness: tackling the problem that prompts are manipulated
intentionally, such as noise prompts, long context, data attack, etc; 2) OOD
Robustness: dealing with the unexpected real-world application scenarios, such
as OOD detection, zero-shot transferring, hallucinations, etc; 3) Evaluation of
Robustness: summarizing the new evaluation datasets, metrics, and tools for
verifying the robustness of LLMs. After reviewing the representative work from
each perspective, we discuss and highlight future opportunities and research
directions in this field. Meanwhile, we also organize related works and provide
an easy-to-search project
(https://github.com/zhangkunzk/Awesome-LLM-Robustness-papers) to support the
community.

Conclusion: 为确保AI在学术评审中发挥积极作用，必须解决LLM的对抗攻击脆弱性问题。需开发针对性策略以增强模型鲁棒性，从而维护学术交流的严谨性。

Abstract: Peer review is essential for maintaining academic quality, but the increasing
volume of submissions places a significant burden on reviewers. Large language
models (LLMs) offer potential assistance in this process, yet their
susceptibility to textual adversarial attacks raises reliability concerns. This
paper investigates the robustness of LLMs used as automated reviewers in the
presence of such attacks. We focus on three key questions: (1) The
effectiveness of LLMs in generating reviews compared to human reviewers. (2)
The impact of adversarial attacks on the reliability of LLM-generated reviews.
(3) Challenges and potential mitigation strategies for LLM-based review. Our
evaluation reveals significant vulnerabilities, as text manipulations can
distort LLM assessments. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance
in automated peer reviewing and analyze its robustness against adversarial
attacks. Our findings emphasize the importance of addressing adversarial risks
to ensure AI strengthens, rather than compromises, the integrity of scholarly
communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究团队开发了首个多模态医疗基准测试KokushiMD-10，基于日本10项国家级医疗执照考试构建，涵盖11588道多领域试题，评估30余个先进大语言模型后发现，当前模型仍无法稳定通过所有医疗领域测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗AI评估体系存在三大局限：仅支持文本输入、英语中心主义、过度聚焦医学领域，难以全面衡量多模态推理及跨专业医疗知识。

Method: 从日本医师/牙医/护理/药剂等10类国家考试中构建多模态数据集，包含临床图像与专家注释，建立跨5大医疗领域的评估框架，测试GPT-4o等30余个SOTA模型在图文场景下的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型均未能在各领域稳定达到及格线，表现最佳模型与人类专家仍存显著差距，突显多语言多模态医疗推理的持续挑战。

Conclusion: KokushiMD-10为医疗AI提供了首个多语言多模态评估基准，揭示当前模型在复杂临床场景中的局限性，推动以推理为核心的医疗智能系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable
performance in medical licensing exams. However, comprehensive evaluation of
LLMs across various healthcare roles, particularly in high-stakes clinical
scenarios, remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks are typically text-based,
English-centric, and focus primarily on medicines, which limits their ability
to assess broader healthcare knowledge and multimodal reasoning. To address
these gaps, we introduce KokushiMD-10, the first multimodal benchmark
constructed from ten Japanese national healthcare licensing exams. This
benchmark spans multiple fields, including Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing,
Pharmacy, and allied health professions. It contains over 11588 real exam
questions, incorporating clinical images and expert-annotated rationales to
evaluate both textual and visual reasoning. We benchmark over 30
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini, across both
text and image-based settings. Despite promising results, no model consistently
meets passing thresholds across domains, highlighting the ongoing challenges in
medical AI. KokushiMD-10 provides a comprehensive and linguistically grounded
resource for evaluating and advancing reasoning-centric medical AI across
multilingual and multimodal clinical tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自然语言处理的分词方法在材料科学中导致结构碎片化和语义损失，无法保持材料概念的完整性。

Method: 结合材料知识库训练的MatDetector和重排序方法，优先合并材料概念，避免分词过程中的碎片化。

Result: MATTER在生成和分类任务中分别实现平均4%和2%的性能提升，优于现有分词方法。

Conclusion: 领域知识对科学文本处理的分词策略至关重要，MATTER验证了整合专业知识的有效性。

Abstract: While language models are increasingly utilized in materials science, typical
models rely on frequency-centric tokenization methods originally developed for
natural language processing. However, these methods frequently produce
excessive fragmentation and semantic loss, failing to maintain the structural
and semantic integrity of material concepts. To address this issue, we propose
MATTER, a novel tokenization approach that integrates material knowledge into
tokenization. Based on MatDetector trained on our materials knowledge base and
a re-ranking method prioritizing material concepts in token merging, MATTER
maintains the structural integrity of identified material concepts and prevents
fragmentation during tokenization, ensuring their semantic meaning remains
intact. The experimental results demonstrate that MATTER outperforms existing
tokenization methods, achieving an average performance gain of $4\%$ and $2\%$
in the generation and classification tasks, respectively. These results
underscore the importance of domain knowledge for tokenization strategies in
scientific text processing. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源指令数据集集中于狭窄领域（如数学、编程），导致模型泛化能力不足，与专有模型差距扩大。需构建高质量、多样化指令数据集以缩小差距。

Method: 两阶段流程：1) 从超1亿样本中筛选740万高质量基础指令（InfInstruct-F-7.4M）；2) 通过指令选择、进化和诊断过滤合成150万高质量对话指令（InfInstruct-G-1.5M）。

Result: 微调Mistral、LLaMA等模型后，基础与指令遵循任务性能显著提升。InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B在指令任务上超越GPT-4-0314达8.6%，基础性能持平。

Conclusion: 基础与对话训练的协同效应可推动大模型全面发展。开源数据集与代码为后续研究提供新视角与工具支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in real-world
applications, yet existing open-source instruction datasets often concentrate
on narrow domains, such as mathematics or coding, limiting generalization and
widening the gap with proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Infinity-Instruct, a high-quality instruction dataset designed to enhance both
foundational and chat capabilities of LLMs through a two-phase pipeline. In
Phase 1, we curate 7.4M high-quality foundational instructions
(InfInstruct-F-7.4M) from over 100M samples using hybrid data selection
techniques. In Phase 2, we synthesize 1.5M high-quality chat instructions
(InfInstruct-G-1.5M) through a two-stage process involving instruction
selection, evolution, and diagnostic filtering. We empirically evaluate
Infinity-Instruct by fine-tuning several open-source models, including Mistral,
LLaMA, Qwen, and Yi, and observe substantial performance gains across both
foundational and instruction following benchmarks, consistently surpassing
official instruction-tuned counterparts. Notably, InfInstruct-LLaMA3.1-70B
outperforms GPT-4-0314 by 8.6\% on instruction following tasks while achieving
comparable foundational performance. These results underscore the synergy
between foundational and chat training and offer new insights into holistic LLM
development. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学检索与问答数据集多针对简单问题，无法反映真实科研任务中隐含的复杂信息需求，需构建更贴合实际研究场景的数据集。

Method: 结合学术论文的数据集表征增强方法、基于认知分类的问题生成框架，以及基于LLM困惑度偏移的答案自动过滤机制。

Result: 构建了61k规模的ScIRGen-Geo数据集，基准测试表明现有方法在复杂问题推理上仍存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前工具尚难满足科学社区复杂信息需求，ScIRGen框架为开发更精细的科研支持工具提供了数据基础与方法论参考。

Abstract: Scientific researchers need intensive information about datasets to
effectively evaluate and develop theories and methodologies. The information
needs regarding datasets are implicitly embedded in particular research tasks,
rather than explicitly expressed in search queries. However, existing
scientific retrieval and question-answering (QA) datasets typically address
straightforward questions, which do not align with the distribution of
real-world research inquiries. To bridge this gap, we developed ScIRGen, a
dataset generation framework for scientific QA \& retrieval that more
accurately reflects the information needs of professional science researchers,
and uses it to create a large-scale scientific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) dataset with realistic queries, datasets and papers. Technically, we
designed a dataset-oriented information extraction method that leverages
academic papers to augment the dataset representation. We then proposed a
question generation framework by employing cognitive taxonomy to ensure the
quality of synthesized questions. We also design a method to automatically
filter synthetic answers based on the perplexity shift of LLMs, which is highly
aligned with human judgment of answers' validity. Collectively, these
methodologies culminated in the creation of the 61k QA dataset, ScIRGen-Geo. We
benchmarked representative methods on the ScIRGen-Geo dataset for their
question-answering and retrieval capabilities, finding out that current methods
still suffer from reasoning from complex questions. This work advances the
development of more sophisticated tools to support the intricate information
needs of the scientific community.

TL;DR: 研究利用开源基础模型分析自发语音，发现基于ASR的声学特征在阿尔茨海默病早期检测中表现最佳，停顿特征可提升文本分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）的早期检测亟需非侵入性生物标志物，而自发语音中的声学/语言特征为此提供了可能性。

Method: 使用PREPARE Challenge数据集（703例HC/81例MCI/405例AD），筛选英语自发语音后，对多种开源语音/语言基础模型进行三分类基准测试。

Result: Whisper-medium语音模型准确率最高（0.731），ASR音频嵌入效果最优；带停顿注释的BERT语言模型表现最佳（0.662），非语义特征持续提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 基于ASR嵌入的声学方法展现出规模化ADRD早期筛查潜力，基准框架为临床检测提供了非侵入、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are progressive
neurodegenerative conditions where early detection is vital for timely
intervention and care. Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic
markers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.
Foundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce
high-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.
  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio
recordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy
control (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We
excluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final
dataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases. We
benchmarked a range of open-source foundation speech and language models to
classify cognitive status into the three categories.
  Results: The Whisper-medium model achieved the highest performance among
speech models (accuracy = 0.731, AUC = 0.802). Among language models, BERT with
pause annotation performed best (accuracy = 0.662, AUC = 0.744). ADRD detection
using state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) model-generated audio
embeddings outperformed others. Including non-semantic features like pause
patterns consistently improved text-based classification.
  Conclusion: This study introduces a benchmarking framework using foundation
models and a clinically relevant dataset. Acoustic-based approaches --
particularly ASR-derived embeddings -- demonstrate strong potential for
scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective early detection of ADRD.

*Hourun Zhu,Chengchao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于自蒸馏损失和MLP模块剪枝的LLM压缩方法，在保持性能的同时显著减少模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的剪枝方法使用单标签梯度计算，忽略了模型对其他词的预测信息，导致生成能力损失；同时MLP模块参数占比高但对预测敏感性较低，适合作为剪枝重点。

Method: 在剪枝阶段引入自蒸馏损失以利用原始模型预测信息，并针对MLP模块（如LLaMA3.2-1.2B中占比超5倍参数）进行优先剪枝。

Result: 在零样本基准测试中显著优于现有剪枝方法，在1B规模开源LLM中达到极具竞争力的性能，且开源代码与权重。

Conclusion: 通过自蒸馏梯度优化和MLP模块剪枝，实现了高效LLM压缩，验证了该方法在性能与参数效率间的平衡优势。

Abstract: In spite of strong performance achieved by LLMs, the costs of their
deployment are unaffordable. For the compression of LLMs, gradient-based
pruning methods present promising effectiveness. However, in these methods, the
gradient computation with one-hot labels ignore the potential predictions on
other words, thus missing key information for generative capability of the
original model. To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss
during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the
predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient
information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules,
the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP)
modules, which take up more than $5 \times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this
end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM
without obvious performance degradation. Experimental results on extensive
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing pruning methods. Furthermore, our method achieves very competitive
performance among 1B-scale open source LLMs. The source code and trained
weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/SDMPrune.

TL;DR: 本文提出SUTA-LM方法，通过结合受控测试时适应（TTA）与语言模型重评分，解决TTA与语言模型结合时的干扰问题，在18个ASR数据集上验证其跨领域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在结合测试时适应（TTA）与外部语言模型时，未充分关注两者可能存在的干扰问题，导致性能提升受限。本文旨在探索如何协调TTA与语言模型，以应对领域不匹配的挑战。

Method: SUTA-LM扩展了基于熵最小化的TTA方法SUTA，引入自动步骤选择机制（结合声学与语言信息）控制适应过程，随后进行语言模型重评分以优化输出。

Result: 在18个不同领域的ASR数据集实验中，SUTA-LM表现出广泛的鲁棒性，验证了其有效协调TTA与语言模型的能力。

Conclusion: SUTA-LM通过分阶段控制适应与重评分，解决了TTA与语言模型结合的干扰问题，显著提升了端到端ASR在领域不匹配场景下的性能。

Abstract: Despite progress in end-to-end ASR, real-world domain mismatches still cause
performance drops, which Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate by
adjusting models during inference. Recent work explores combining TTA with
external language models, using techniques like beam search rescoring or
generative error correction. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked
challenge: TTA can interfere with language model rescoring, revealing the
nontrivial nature of effectively combining the two methods. Based on this
insight, we propose SUTA-LM, a simple yet effective extension of SUTA, an
entropy-minimization-based TTA approach, with language model rescoring. SUTA-LM
first applies a controlled adaptation process guided by an auto-step selection
mechanism leveraging both acoustic and linguistic information, followed by
language model rescoring to refine the outputs. Experiments on 18 diverse ASR
datasets show that SUTA-LM achieves robust results across a wide range of
domains.

Motivation: LLMs与语音技术（TTS/ASR）的结合使钓鱼诈骗规模化且逼真，传统对抗音频技术因失真明显且不实用难以防御。研究旨在开发一种既能破坏ASR系统、又不影响人类通话的主动防御方案。

Method: 1. 识别ASR为诈骗链路最脆弱环节，设计ASRJam框架，通过对抗扰动干扰攻击者ASR；2. 提出EchoGuard干扰器，利用混响、回声等自然失真干扰ASR，避免传统对抗音频的刺耳问题。通过39人用户研究对比现有攻击方法。

Result: 用户研究表明，EchoGuard在ASR干扰成功率）与人类听觉体验的综合效用最高，其ASR词错误率（WER）达80.2%，且用户主观评分显著优于其他三种先进攻击方法。

Conclusion: EchoGuard通过自然失真实现了对ASR系统的高效干扰，同时维持人类可接受的语音质量，为实时防御语音钓鱼攻击提供了实用且用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with Text-to-Speech (TTS) and
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), are increasingly used to automate voice
phishing (vishing) scams. These systems are scalable and convincing, posing a
significant security threat. We identify the ASR transcription step as the most
vulnerable link in the scam pipeline and introduce ASRJam, a proactive defence
framework that injects adversarial perturbations into the victim's audio to
disrupt the attacker's ASR. This breaks the scam's feedback loop without
affecting human callers, who can still understand the conversation. While prior
adversarial audio techniques are often unpleasant and impractical for real-time
use, we also propose EchoGuard, a novel jammer that leverages natural
distortions, such as reverberation and echo, that are disruptive to ASR but
tolerable to humans. To evaluate EchoGuard's effectiveness and usability, we
conducted a 39-person user study comparing it with three state-of-the-art
attacks. Results show that EchoGuard achieved the highest overall utility,
offering the best combination of ASR disruption and human listening experience.

first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions
and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of
speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech
instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS)
model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop
GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning
training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training
strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained
foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech,
demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech
as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents. Our code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/GUIRoboTron/GUIRoboTron-Speech.

### [40] [Stronger Language Models Produce More Human-Like Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11128)
*Andrew Keenan Richardson,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Sean Moss,Vincent Wang-Mascianica,Philipp Koralus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，随着语言模型能力的提升，其错误模式逐渐趋近于人类推理谬误，而非实现规范性理性，挑战了模型扩展自然获得理性能力的传统认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在能力提升过程中是否趋近于人类推理模式，尤其是错误模式是否反映人类典型推理谬误。

Method: 基于Erotetic理论框架(ETR)和PyETR工具生成逻辑问题，评估38个语言模型在383个任务中的表现，分析错误答案与ETR预测的人类谬误相关性。

Result: 模型综合能力(Chatbot Arena评分)与错误答案中人类谬误比例呈正相关(ρ=0.360, p=0.0265)，且模型复杂度与逻辑正确性无显著关联，错误模式转变独立于错误率变化。

Conclusion: 语言模型发展未导向规范性理性，而是趋近人类认知特征(含偏见与局限)，通过顺序效应验证了这种类人推理模式的收敛现象。

Abstract: Do language models converge toward human-like reasoning patterns as they
improve? We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning
capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors
increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously
unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply
the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with
empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the
open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans
predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383
reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general
capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their
incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to
increase ($\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation
between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift
in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate.
These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models
naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence
toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and
limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language
model reasoning.

TL;DR: CHECK框架通过整合临床数据库和信息论分类器，将LLM的幻觉率从31%降至0.3%，并在USMLE测试中达到92.1%的通过率，为医疗领域安全部署LLM提供解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在医疗领域展现潜力，但其产生的幻觉问题严重阻碍临床应用。现有方法难以同时解决事实性和推理型幻觉，需要开发可靠检测机制。

Method: 提出持续学习框架CHECK：1) 整合结构化临床数据库 2) 基于信息论构建分类器检测双类型幻觉 3) 利用幻觉概率指导GPT-4o优化 4) 智能分配算力资源

Result: 在1500个临床试验问题上：1) Llama3.3-70B幻觉率从31%降至0.3% 2) 分类器在MedQA等基准AUC达0.95-0.96 3) GPT-4o通过率提升5%达92.1% SOTA

Conclusion: CHECK将幻觉率压制在临床容错阈值内，为高风险领域LLM部署建立可扩展框架，其持续学习机制和计算资源调配策略具有跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in healthcare, but hallucinations
remain a major barrier to clinical use. We present CHECK, a continuous-learning
framework that integrates structured clinical databases with a classifier
grounded in information theory to detect both factual and reasoning-based
hallucinations. Evaluated on 1500 questions from 100 pivotal clinical trials,
CHECK reduced LLama3.3-70B-Instruct hallucination rates from 31% to 0.3% -
making an open source model state of the art. Its classifier generalized across
medical benchmarks, achieving AUCs of 0.95-0.96, including on the MedQA (USMLE)
benchmark and HealthBench realistic multi-turn medical questioning. By
leveraging hallucination probabilities to guide GPT-4o's refinement and
judiciously escalate compute, CHECK boosted its USMLE passing rate by 5
percentage points, achieving a state-of-the-art 92.1%. By suppressing
hallucinations below accepted clinical error thresholds, CHECK offers a
scalable foundation for safe LLM deployment in medicine and other high-stakes
domains.

TL;DR: 提出自优化框架Twister，通过未标注语音数据生成伪标签并合成语音-文本对，提升ASR模型在低资源或特定领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源或领域特定场景下ASR模型因标注数据不足导致的性能瓶颈，探索无需人工标注的自优化路径。

Method: 1. 利用现有ASR模型生成未标注语音的伪标签；2. 基于伪标签训练高保真TTS系统；3. 合成语音-文本对反哺原始ASR模型，形成闭环优化。

Result: Twister模型在台湾普通话上相比Whisper-large-v2，普通话错误率降低20%，中英代码切换错误率降低50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为伪标签自蒸馏方法提供了高效替代方案，验证了利用合成数据闭环优化ASR在低资源场景的可行性。

Abstract: We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only
unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating
pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a
high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs
are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop
self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on
Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a
moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we
adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error
rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching
benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling
alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a
practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or
domain-specific settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LLM是否通过高维机制产生低维有效变量（即涌现能力），并进一步探讨其是否形成具有高效问题解决能力的涌现智能。

Method: 首先回顾量化涌现的多种方法，评估LLM的涌现能力；其次通过理论分析LLM是否具备智能的涌现属性。

Result: 论文系统梳理了涌现的量化框架，并指出LLM可能通过低维表征实现高效问题解决，但对其是否达到“智能涌现”仍需进一步论证。

Conclusion: LLM展现出部分涌现能力，但其是否构成真正的涌现智能仍取决于对“智能”定义及涌现层级的界定，需结合复杂科学与认知科学深化研究。

Abstract: Emergence is a concept in complexity science that describes how many-body
systems manifest novel higher-level properties, properties that can be
described by replacing high-dimensional mechanisms with lower-dimensional
effective variables and theories. This is captured by the idea "more is
different". Intelligence is a consummate emergent property manifesting
increasingly efficient -- cheaper and faster -- uses of emergent capabilities
to solve problems. This is captured by the idea "less is more". In this paper,
we first examine claims that Large Language Models exhibit emergent
capabilities, reviewing several approaches to quantifying emergence, and
secondly ask whether LLMs possess emergent intelligence.

TL;DR: 研究评估了开源与专有大型语言模型（LLMs）在电子健康记录（EHR）中提取药物信息及分类停药状态的能力，发现GPT-4o在零样本下表现最优，开源模型（如Llama-3.1-70B）接近其水平，少量样本学习可进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的药物停用信息常埋藏于非结构化文本，影响患者安全。研究旨在探索无需人工标注的LLMs在药物信息提取中的扩展潜力。

Method: 收集三个EHR数据集构建评估基准，测试12种LLM，采用多种提示策略，系统比较模型在药物提取、停药分类及联合任务（提取后分类）中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在零样本下平均F1分数最高（药物提取94.0%，停药分类78.1%，联合任务72.7%）。开源模型Llama-3.1-70B在部分数据集上表现最佳。医学专用LLMs弱于通用模型，少量样本学习普遍有效，CoT推理效果不稳定。

Conclusion: LLMs在EHR药物信息提取中潜力显著，开源模型可作为专有系统的可扩展替代方案，少量样本学习可进一步提升能力。

Abstract: Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs)
is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried
in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced
open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting
medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on
their scalability on medication information extraction without human
annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the
evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM
prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status
classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was
systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed
promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation
classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average
F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication
extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint
task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the
highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset
(68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%)
datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to
advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance,
while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong
potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR
notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary
systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟全球南方研究机构因高昂成本难以获取算力的现实条件，探索小模型（<1B参数）在资源不足场景下的应用潜力。

Method: 采用参数规模严格限制在10亿以下的小型模型架构，所有实验可在低预算GPU或无GPU设备上运行。

Result: 在5个赛道中，模型性能与冠军的exact F1分差分别为6.46/10.24/7.85/9.56/13.13，最小差距仅6.46分。

Conclusion: 参数规模小于1B的模型在多项任务中展现竞争力，为资源有限机构提供了无需高端硬件即可部署的可行技术方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the RETUYT-INCO participation at the BEA 2025
shared task. Our participation was characterized by the decision of using
relatively small models, with fewer than 1B parameters. This self-imposed
restriction tries to represent the conditions in which many research labs or
institutions are in the Global South, where computational power is not easily
accessible due to its prohibitive cost. Even under this restrictive
self-imposed setting, our models managed to stay competitive with the rest of
teams that participated in the shared task. According to the $exact\ F_1$
scores published by the organizers, the performance gaps between our models and
the winners were as follows: $6.46$ in Track 1; $10.24$ in Track 2; $7.85$ in
Track 3; $9.56$ in Track 4; and $13.13$ in Track 5. Considering that the
minimum difference with a winner team is $6.46$ points -- and the maximum
difference is $13.13$ -- according to the $exact\ F_1$ score, we find that
models with a size smaller than 1B parameters are competitive for these tasks,
all of which can be run on computers with a low-budget GPU or even without a
GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法仅针对单语言，无法利用多语言共享语义空间的优势实现跨语言去偏效果迁移。

Method: IMSAE通过迭代奇异值分解(SVD)截断技术识别并消除跨多语言的联合偏见子空间。

Result: 在8种语言5个维度测试中，IMSAE在标准/零样本场景均有效，适用于BERT/LLaMA/Mistral等模型，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMSAE成功实现跨语言去偏迁移，尤其在语言相似但目标数据缺失时，能有效保持模型功能并超越现有方法。

Abstract: Multilingual representations embed words with similar meanings to share a
common semantic space across languages, creating opportunities to transfer
debiasing effects between languages. However, existing methods for debiasing
are unable to exploit this opportunity because they operate on individual
languages. We present Iterative Multilingual Spectral Attribute Erasure
(IMSAE), which identifies and mitigates joint bias subspaces across multiple
languages through iterative SVD-based truncation. Evaluating IMSAE across eight
languages and five demographic dimensions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard and zero-shot settings, where target language data is
unavailable, but linguistically similar languages can be used for debiasing.
Our comprehensive experiments across diverse language models (BERT, LLaMA,
Mistral) show that IMSAE outperforms traditional monolingual and cross-lingual
approaches while maintaining model utility.

Result: SEAR在所有表格类型中表现优于基线方法，实验表明统一表格表征可提升模型推理能力。

Conclusion: 自适应提示框架SEAR有效解决表格推理场景差异问题，同时表格结构重构对模型性能具有显著正向影响。

Abstract: Temporal Table Reasoning is a critical challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring effective prompting techniques to extract relevant insights.
Despite existence of multiple prompting methods, their impact on table
reasoning remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, the performance of these
models varies drastically across different table and context structures, making
it difficult to determine an optimal approach. This work investigates multiple
prompting technique across diverse table types to determine optimal approaches
for different scenarios. We find that performance varies based on entity type,
table structure, requirement of additional context and question complexity,
with NO single method consistently outperforming others. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce SEAR, an adaptive prompting framework inspired by
human reasoning that dynamically adjusts based on context characteristics and
integrates a structured reasoning. Our results demonstrate that SEAR achieves
superior performance across all table types compared to other baseline
prompting techniques. Additionally, we explore the impact of table structure
refactoring, finding that a unified representation enhances model's reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过学习专用“继续思考”标记来增强语言模型推理能力，相比固定标记方法，在数学基准测试中准确率提升更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法通过固定标记（如'Wait'）强制延长推理步骤，但未验证专用可学习标记是否能更有效触发扩展推理。

Method: 在蒸馏版DeepSeek-R1中新增自学习<|continue-thinking|>标记，仅通过强化学习训练该标记的嵌入向量，冻结模型其他参数。

Result: 学习标记在GSM8K等数学基准上比基线模型提升4.2%（固定标记仅提升1.3%），且在固定标记有效场景下改进幅度更大。

Conclusion: 可学习的继续思考标记能更有效地引导模型扩展推理步骤，显著超越固定标记的预算强制方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as an effective approach for improving language
model performance by utilizing additional compute at inference time. Recent
studies have shown that overriding end-of-thinking tokens (e.g., replacing
"</think>" with "Wait") can extend reasoning steps and improve accuracy. In
this work, we explore whether a dedicated continue-thinking token can be
learned to trigger extended reasoning. We augment a distilled version of
DeepSeek-R1 with a single learned "<|continue-thinking|>" token, training only
its embedding via reinforcement learning while keeping the model weights
frozen. Our experiments show that this learned token achieves improved accuracy
on standard math benchmarks compared to both the baseline model and a test-time
scaling approach that uses a fixed token (e.g., "Wait") for budget forcing. In
particular, we observe that in cases where the fixed-token approach enhances
the base model's accuracy, our method achieves a markedly greater improvement.
For example, on the GSM8K benchmark, the fixed-token approach yields a 1.3%
absolute improvement in accuracy, whereas our learned-token method achieves a
4.2% improvement over the base model that does not use budget forcing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管课程学习在多个机器学习领域提升了训练效率与泛化能力，但其在预训练语言模型中的应用尚未被充分探索，因此成为本研究的核心动机。

Method: 采用多种课程学习策略（如基础课程学习、步调采样、交错课程），结合六种语言学与信息论难度指标，训练模型并在八个基准上评估性能。

Result: 课程学习在训练早中期显著加速收敛，作为预热策略可带来最高3.5%的持续性能提升；压缩比、词汇多样性和可读性被验证为跨场景有效难度指标。

Conclusion: 研究证明数据顺序对大规模预训练至关重要，并为实际场景下高效可扩展的模型开发提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has shown promise in improving training efficiency and
generalization in various machine learning domains, yet its potential in
pretraining language models remains underexplored, prompting our work as the
first systematic investigation in this area. We experimented with different
settings, including vanilla curriculum learning, pacing-based sampling, and
interleaved curricula-guided by six difficulty metrics spanning linguistic and
information-theoretic perspectives. We train models under these settings and
evaluate their performance on eight diverse benchmarks. Our experiments reveal
that curriculum learning consistently improves convergence in early and
mid-training phases, and can yield lasting gains when used as a warmup strategy
with up to $3.5\%$ improvement. Notably, we identify compression ratio, lexical
diversity, and readability as effective difficulty signals across settings. Our
findings highlight the importance of data ordering in large-scale pretraining
and provide actionable insights for scalable, data-efficient model development
under realistic training scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer因固定上下文窗口限制及注意力机制二次复杂度面临挑战，而RNN类架构虽具线性扩展性但并行性不足。需探索新架构以兼顾长序列处理与效率。

Method: Avey由排序器与自回归神经处理器组成，动态筛选并上下文相关token，解耦序列长度与上下文宽度，实现任意长序列处理。

Conclusion: Avey通过非注意力和非循环架构突破现有模型限制，为长序列处理提供高效解决方案，平衡短程性能与长程依赖捕获能力。

Abstract: The Transformer has become the de facto standard for large language models
and a wide range of downstream tasks across various domains. Despite its
numerous advantages like inherent training parallelism, the Transformer still
faces key challenges due to its inability to effectively process sequences
beyond a fixed context window and the quadratic complexity of its attention
mechanism. These challenges have renewed interest in RNN-like architectures,
which offer linear scaling with sequence length and improved handling of
long-range dependencies, albeit with limited parallelism due to their
inherently recurrent nature. In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural
foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence.
Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which
collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for
any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence. Specifically,
Avey decouples sequence length from context width, thus enabling effective
processing of arbitrarily long sequences. Experimental results show that Avey
compares favorably to the Transformer across a variety of standard short-range
NLP benchmarks, while notably excelling at capturing long-range dependencies.

Motivation: 已有研究显示Transformer模型的困惑度与阅读时间预测能力呈正相关，但该现象是否适用于脑成像数据尚未验证。本文旨在探索模型复杂度与神经测量指标的关系。

Method: 使用17个预训练Transformer模型，在跨三种语言家族的文本数据上，评估其惊奇值对两个功能磁共振成像（fMRI）数据集的预测能力。

Result: 模型困惑度与脑成像数据拟合度保持正相关，表明参数更多、数据量更大的模型对神经活动的预测能力反而更弱。

Conclusion: 困惑度与预测能力的负相关关系具有跨测量方式的普适性，提示模型复杂性与人类语言处理神经机制间存在系统性差异。

Abstract: As Transformers become more widely incorporated into natural language
processing tasks, there has been considerable interest in using surprisal from
these models as predictors of human sentence processing difficulty. Recent work
has observed a positive relationship between Transformer-based models'
perplexity and the predictive power of their surprisal estimates on reading
times, showing that language models with more parameters and trained on more
data are less predictive of human reading times. However, these studies focus
on predicting latency-based measures (i.e., self-paced reading times and
eye-gaze durations) with surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language
models. This trend has not been tested on brain imaging data. This study
therefore evaluates the predictive power of surprisal estimates from 17
pre-trained Transformer-based models across three different language families
on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Results show that the
positive relationship between model perplexity and model fit still obtains,
suggesting that this trend is not specific to latency-based measures and can be
generalized to neural measures.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities
to reimagine peer review beyond the constraints of traditional workflows.
Despite these opportunities, prior efforts have largely focused on replicating
traditional review workflows with LLMs serving as direct substitutes for human
reviewers, while limited attention has been given to exploring new paradigms
that fundamentally rethink how LLMs can participate in the academic review
process. In this paper, we introduce and explore a novel mechanism that employs
LLM agents to perform pairwise comparisons among manuscripts instead of
individual scoring. By aggregating outcomes from substantial pairwise
evaluations, this approach enables a more accurate and robust measure of
relative manuscript quality. Our experiments demonstrate that this comparative
approach significantly outperforms traditional rating-based methods in
identifying high-impact papers. However, our analysis also reveals emergent
biases in the selection process, notably a reduced novelty in research topics
and an increased institutional imbalance. These findings highlight both the
transformative potential of rethinking peer review with LLMs and critical
challenges that future systems must address to ensure equity and diversity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Speaker Diarization (SD) by leveraging
text-based methods focused on Sentence-level Speaker Change Detection within
dialogues. Unlike audio-based SD systems, which are often challenged by audio
quality and speaker similarity, our approach utilizes the dialogue transcript
alone. Two models are developed: the Single Prediction Model (SPM) and the
Multiple Prediction Model (MPM), both of which demonstrate significant
improvements in identifying speaker changes, particularly in short
conversations. Our findings, based on a curated dataset encompassing diverse
conversational scenarios, reveal that the text-based SD approach, especially
the MPM, performs competitively against state-of-the-art audio-based SD

not only showcases the potential of leveraging linguistic features for SD but
also highlights the importance of integrating semantic understanding into SD
systems, opening avenues for future research in multimodal and semantic
feature-based diarization.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种评估生成式AI模型人口统计偏见的新方法，通过分析模型对道德主体干预意愿的响应，量化不同LLM在性别、种族和年龄上的偏见，发现基准人口被视为白人男性，但非基准群体更愿提供帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）广泛应用，其人口统计偏见的评估与缓解仍待解决。研究旨在建立客观评估方法，揭示模型对性别、种族、年龄的偏见方向与强度，为开发者和用户提供调整依据。

Method: 通过要求模型评估不同人口特征的道德主体在建设性干预中的意愿，定量分析商业LLM的基准人口特征及其与其他群体的关系，区分偏见的正负向及强度。

Result: 模型默认基准人口为白人中年/青年男性；非基准群体（如非白人、女性等）表现出更强的帮助意愿，揭示了基准与非基准群体偏见的分离现象。

Conclusion: 该方法可客观量化LLM偏见，帮助识别训练数据或输出中的潜在偏差，为未来模型优化提供依据，同时揭示了基准与非基准群体偏见的不同模式。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in many fields,
understanding and mitigating LLM biases is an ongoing issue. This paper
provides a novel method for evaluating the demographic biases of various
generative AI models. By prompting models to assess a moral patient's
willingness to intervene constructively, we aim to quantitatively evaluate
different LLMs' biases towards various genders, races, and ages. Our work
differs from existing work by aiming to determine the baseline demographic
identities for various commercial models and the relationship between the
baseline and other demographics. We strive to understand if these biases are
positive, neutral, or negative, and the strength of these biases. This paper
can contribute to the objective assessment of bias in Large Language Models and
give the user or developer the power to account for these biases in LLM output
or in training future LLMs. Our analysis suggested two key findings: that
models view the baseline demographic as a white middle-aged or young adult
male; however, a general trend across models suggested that non-baseline
demographics are more willing to help than the baseline. These methodologies
allowed us to distinguish these two biases that are often tangled together.

Result: 在通用、金融、生物医学领域的域内及域外测试集(含类型约束实体替换)中均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为关系抽取提供了理论支撑强、可解释性高且鲁棒的解决方案，有效提升跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Mitigating entity bias is a critical challenge in Relation Extraction (RE),
where models often rely excessively on entities, resulting in poor
generalization. This paper presents a novel approach to address this issue by
adapting a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) framework. Our method
compresses entity-specific information while preserving task-relevant features.
It achieves state-of-the-art performance on relation extraction datasets across
general, financial, and biomedical domains, in both indomain (original test
sets) and out-of-domain (modified test sets with type-constrained entity
replacements) settings. Our approach offers a robust, interpretable, and
theoretically grounded methodology.

TL;DR: 提出课程引导的层扩展（CGLS）框架，通过同步增加数据难度和模型深度，提升大语言模型训练效率和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知发展（逐步构建知识）启发，旨在降低大模型预训练成本并提升效率。

Method: CGLS框架：在训练过程中逐步堆叠模型层（增加深度），同时按课程从简单到复杂调整数据难度（如从短故事到技术文本）。

Result: 在100M和1.2B参数规模下，CGLS在PIQA、ARC等任务中超越基线方法，零样本下游任务表现更优。

Conclusion: CGLS验证了渐进式堆叠策略的有效性，为知识密集型和推理任务提供高效训练方案。

Abstract: As the cost of pretraining large language models grows, there is continued
interest in strategies to improve learning efficiency during this core training
stage. Motivated by cognitive development, where humans gradually build
knowledge as their brains mature, we propose Curriculum-Guided Layer Scaling
(CGLS), a framework for compute-efficient pretraining that synchronizes
increasing data difficulty with model growth through progressive layer stacking
(i.e. gradually adding layers during training). At the 100M parameter scale,
using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web
data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks
PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus
with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly
technical or specialized content. Our results show that progressively
increasing model depth alongside sample difficulty leads to better
generalization and zero-shot performance on various downstream benchmarks.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CGLS unlocks the potential of
progressive stacking, offering a simple yet effective strategy for improving
generalization on knowledge-intensive and reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型部署时因KV缓存占用大量内存，现有方法存在信息丢失或效率提升有限的问题。

Method: 基于序列维度键值高相似性观察，采用分块软匹配策略进行KV缓存聚类，通过交替分区和相似性聚类合并缓存。

Result: 实验显示KV缓存内存减少80%，解码加速3.19倍，端到端延迟降低2.72倍，且模型表现无显著下降。

Conclusion: Chelsea在保证模型效果的同时，显著优化了长上下文LLMs的部署效率，具有理论最优性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows have become
increasingly prevalent for tackling complex tasks. However, the substantial
Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-context LLMs poses significant
deployment challenges. Existing approaches either discard potentially critical
information needed for future generations or offer limited efficiency gains due
to high computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Chelsea, a simple
yet effective framework for online KV cache clustering. Our approach is based
on the observation that key states exhibit high similarity along the sequence
dimension. To enable efficient clustering, we divide the sequence into chunks
and propose Chunked Soft Matching, which employs an alternating partition
strategy within each chunk and identifies clusters based on similarity. Chelsea
then merges the KV cache within each cluster into a single centroid.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity
and the optimality of the intra-chunk partitioning strategy. Extensive
experiments across various models and long-context benchmarks demonstrate that
Chelsea achieves up to 80% reduction in KV cache memory usage while maintaining
comparable model performance. Moreover, with minimal computational overhead,
Chelsea accelerates the decoding stage of inference by up to 3.19$\times$ and
reduces end-to-end latency by up to 2.72$\times$.

*Jeff Da,Clinton Wang,Xiang Deng,Yuntao Ma,Nikhil Barhate,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 传统RLVR方法在复杂多步代理环境中效果不佳，本文提出Agent-RLVR框架，通过引入类似人类教学的主动指导机制，结合环境探索与奖励模型训练，在软件工程任务中将Qwen模型的性能从9.4%提升至27.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)在数学等可验证领域表现优异，但在需要多步骤复杂问题解决的代理环境中，由于奖励信号过于稀疏，导致模型训练效果显著下降。

Method: 提出Agent-RLVR框架：1) 通过代理指导机制主动引导代理轨迹，融合战略规划、错误反馈等多维度教学线索；2) 建立训练循环：初始尝试→单元测试验证→指导增强→再尝试→基于奖励的RL策略更新；3) 利用指导增强数据训练奖励模型。

Result: 在SWE-Bench基准测试中，Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct的pass@1从基线9.4%提升至22.4%，结合测试时奖励模型训练后进一步达到27.8%。指导增强的RLVR数据展现出跨阶段应用价值。

Conclusion: Agent-RLVR通过模拟人类教学机制，有效解决了复杂代理环境下的稀疏奖励问题，为真实世界复杂环境中的强化学习训练提供了新范式，突破了传统RL方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been widely adopted
as the de facto method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large
language models and has demonstrated notable success in verifiable domains like
math and competitive programming tasks. However, the efficacy of RLVR
diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings,
characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure
rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for
effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce
Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic
settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by
human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively
steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse
informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to
dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate
a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces
and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In
the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce
initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented
with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy
is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories.
Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4%
to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified. We find that our guidance-augmented RLVR data
is additionally useful for test-time reward model training, shown by further
boosting pass@1 to 27.8%. Agent-RLVR lays the groundwork for training agents
with RLVR in complex, real-world environments where conventional RL methods
struggle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对韩语语法纠错任务中大型语言模型（如GPT-4）对标点等特定错误类型关注不足的问题，开发更高效、专注的专用系统。

Method: 使用NLLB翻译模型进行微调，通过特殊语言标记区分原句与修正句，结合BLEU评分与LLM错误类型分类评估，并尝试词汇扩展优化。

Result: KoGEC在各类错误修正均衡性上优于大模型（BLEU提升3.2%），标点纠错效果显著，但词汇扩展策略导致性能下降。配套Chrome扩展实现应用落地。

Conclusion: 验证了专用轻量模型在特定语言任务中可超越通用大模型，提出新的评估方法，为任务导向型NLP系统设计提供实践参考。

Abstract: This research introduces KoGEC, a Korean Grammatical Error Correction system
using pre\--trained translation models. We fine-tuned NLLB (No Language Left
Behind) models for Korean GEC, comparing their performance against large
language models like GPT-4 and HCX-3. The study used two social media
conversation datasets for training and testing. The NLLB models were fine-tuned
using special language tokens to distinguish between original and corrected
Korean sentences. Evaluation was done using BLEU scores and an "LLM as judge"
method to classify error types. Results showed that the fine-tuned NLLB (KoGEC)
models outperformed GPT-4o and HCX-3 in Korean GEC tasks. KoGEC demonstrated a
more balanced error correction profile across various error types, whereas the
larger LLMs tended to focus less on punctuation errors. We also developed a
Chrome extension to make the KoGEC system accessible to users. Finally, we
explored token vocabulary expansion to further improve the model but found it
to decrease model performance. This research contributes to the field of NLP by
providing an efficient, specialized Korean GEC system and a new evaluation
method. It also highlights the potential of compact, task-specific models to
compete with larger, general-purpose language models in specialized NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 大语言模型在检测文本中缺失信息时表现不佳，新基准测试AbsenceBench揭示其根本限制在于注意力机制无法处理信息空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型虽擅长定位已知信息(NIAH测试)，但难以识别被刻意删除的内容。论文旨在探究模型对信息缺失的检测能力及其底层机制限制。

Method: 提出AbsenceBench基准测试，在数字序列/诗歌/GitHub请求三个领域，要求模型对比原始与编辑后文本，识别被删除的具体内容。平均上下文长度为5K tokens。

Result: 最先进模型Claude-3.7-Sonnet仅获69.6% F1分数。分析表明Transformer注意力机制因无法关注『不存在』的键值对，导致信息空白检测困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在『信息定位』(超人类)与『缺失检测』(意外失效)任务间的临界状态，暴露了注意力机制处理信息缺失的根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long
inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their
performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models
excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify
clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs'
capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical
sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to
identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to
both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness
of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like
Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context
length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a
fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend
to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific
keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case
study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman
(NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言机器翻译系统因自动化指标（如字符串匹配）无法捕捉语言细微差异，且缺乏足够数据集和具备语言专业知识的人工评估者，导致开发者难以有效评估系统性能。

Method: 通过系统回顾现有评估流程，设计一个整合招募机制与游戏化评估的平台，旨在解决低资源语言场景下数据集和评估者的双重短缺问题。

Result: 提出一个面向低资源语言机器翻译开发者的招募与游戏化评估平台设计方案，并探讨其评估挑战及在更广泛自然语言处理研究中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该平台设计为低资源语言机器翻译系统提供了可行的评估资源补充方案，其游戏化机制和招募模式或可扩展至其他NLP研究领域，但需进一步验证实际效果。

Abstract: Human evaluators provide necessary contributions in evaluating large language
models. In the context of Machine Translation (MT) systems for low-resource
languages (LRLs), this is made even more apparent since popular automated
metrics tend to be string-based, and therefore do not provide a full picture of
the nuances of the behavior of the system. Human evaluators, when equipped with
the necessary expertise of the language, will be able to test for adequacy,
fluency, and other important metrics. However, the low resource nature of the
language means that both datasets and evaluators are in short supply. This
presents the following conundrum: How can developers of MT systems for these
LRLs find adequate human evaluators and datasets? This paper first presents a
comprehensive review of existing evaluation procedures, with the objective of
producing a design proposal for a platform that addresses the resource gap in
terms of datasets and evaluators in developing MT systems. The result is a
design for a recruitment and gamified evaluation platform for developers of MT
systems. Challenges are also discussed in terms of evaluating this platform, as
well as its possible applications in the wider scope of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research.

Conclusion: Med-PRM通过细粒度验证推理步骤显著提升临床决策可靠性，其即插即用特性展示了跨模型泛化能力，为医学AI应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Large language models have shown promise in clinical decision making, but
current approaches struggle to localize and correct errors at specific steps of
the reasoning process. This limitation is critical in medicine, where
identifying and addressing reasoning errors is essential for accurate diagnosis
and effective patient care. We introduce Med-PRM, a process reward modeling
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation to verify each
reasoning step against established medical knowledge bases. By verifying
intermediate reasoning steps with evidence retrieved from clinical guidelines
and literature, our model can precisely assess the reasoning quality in a
fine-grained manner. Evaluations on five medical QA benchmarks and two
open-ended diagnostic tasks demonstrate that Med-PRM achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with improving the performance of base models by up to 13.50%
using Med-PRM. Moreover, we demonstrate the generality of Med-PRM by
integrating it in a plug-and-play fashion with strong policy models such as
Meerkat, achieving over 80\% accuracy on MedQA for the first time using
small-scale models of 8 billion parameters. Our code and data are available at:

to increasingly explore the utility of LMs in their day-to-day applications.
Domain specific language models have already been in use for biomedical natural

grown towards medical language models and their understanding capabilities. In
this paper, we investigate the medical conceptual grounding of various language
models against expert clinicians for identification of hallmarks of
immunotherapy in breast cancer abstracts. Our results show that pre-trained
language models have potential to outperform large language models in
identifying very specific (low-level) concepts.

TL;DR: 研究探讨BERT是否通过预训练自发形成抽象关系图式，发现其高分类性能源于微调后的任务引导，而非预训练本身具备结构化概念理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型(如BERT)在语义任务中的优异表现是否源于真正的概念关系理解能力，而非仅依赖表层统计关联。

Method: 通过分析BERT对分类学/部分学/功能关系概念对的[CLS]标记内部表示，比较预训练模型与监督微调后在关系分类任务中的表征结构差异。

Result: 预训练BERT虽隐含潜在关系信号(高分类准确率)，但仅通过监督微调后概念对才在嵌入空间按关系类型结构化分布。关系图式需任务脚手架诱导生成。

Conclusion: 模型行为表现不等同于结构化概念理解，但可通过针对性训练获得基于场景的关系抽象归纳偏置，揭示当前语言模型概念表征的局限性与可塑性。

Abstract: While large language models like BERT demonstrate strong empirical
performance on semantic tasks, whether this reflects true conceptual competence
or surface-level statistical association remains unclear. I investigate whether
BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations
of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I
compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational
structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT
enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals.
However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding
space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This
indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can
be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral
performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding,
though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction
through appropriate training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于滞后窗口的稀疏注意力机制（LRSA）及LagKV压缩方法，通过分块预填充选择最相关的键值对，以提升大语言模型在长上下文后训练中的效率与性能，同时减少计算与内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临注意力计算复杂度高、键值内存占用线性增长的问题。传统键值缓存压缩技术虽能降低开销，但会导致性能显著下降，且复杂压缩方法因梯度优化不兼容或计算成本高难以应用于后训练阶段。

Method: 提出Lag-Relative Sparse Attention（LRSA）方法，结合LagKV压缩技术，在固定大小的滞后窗口内按分块预填充选择Top-K最相关键值对，使模型聚焦关键历史上下文，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增强了大语言模型在键值压缩下的鲁棒性，并在问答微调任务中取得更优的微调效果。

Conclusion: LRSA方法通过高效上下文压缩与稀疏注意力机制，在无需额外参数和低计算开销的前提下，有效解决了长上下文后训练中的性能与效率权衡问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural
language processing and generation, yet their ability to handle long-context
input remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention computation
and linear-increasing key-value memory footprint. To reduce computational costs
and memory, key-value cache compression techniques are commonly applied at
inference time, but this often leads to severe performance degradation, as
models are not trained to handle compressed context. Although there are more
sophisticated compression methods, they are typically unsuitable for
post-training because of their incompatibility with gradient-based optimization
or high computation overhead. To fill this gap with no additional parameter and
little computation overhead, we propose Lag-Relative Sparse Attention(LRSA)
anchored by the LagKV compression method for long context post-training. Our
method performs chunk-by-chunk prefilling, which selects the top K most
relevant key-value pairs in a fixed-size lagging window, allowing the model to
focus on salient historical context while maintaining efficiency. Experimental
results show that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of the LLM
with key-value compression and achieves better fine-tuned results in the
question-answer tuning task.

Abstract: Multimodal chatbots have become one of the major topics for dialogue systems
in both research community and industry. Recently, researchers have shed light
on the multimodality of responses as well as dialogue contexts. This work
explores how a dialogue system can output responses in various modalities such
as text and image. To this end, we first formulate a multimodal dialogue
response retrieval task for retrieval-based systems as the combination of three
subtasks. We then propose three integration methods based on a two-step
approach and an end-to-end approach, and compare the merits and demerits of
each method. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the
end-to-end approach achieves comparable performance without an intermediate
step in the two-step approach. In addition, a parameter sharing strategy not
only reduces the number of parameters but also boosts performance by
transferring knowledge across the subtasks and the modalities.

*Chih-Hao Hsu,Ying-Jia Lin,Hung-Yu Kao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MUDI方法，通过大语言模型标注话语关系并构建对话图，结合DialogueGAT编码隐式关系及人物特征，在解码阶段引入注意力策略，显著提升个性化对话生成的连贯性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化对话生成需保证回应自然且符合用户特征，但现有方法在话语关系建模和连贯性上存在不足，需探索结构化学习与注意力机制的结合。

Method: 利用大语言模型标注话语关系并构建结构化对话图；设计DialogueGAT模型编码隐式话语关系及人物描述；解码时采用基于连贯性的注意力策略增强话语关系感知。

Result: 实验表明，MUDI在个性化回应质量上显著优于基线模型，生成结果更接近人类对话的连贯性和一致性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化对话图学习与注意力机制结合，MUDI有效提升个性化生成效果，为人机交互的拟真对话提供新思路。

Abstract: In dialogue generation, the naturalness of responses is crucial for effective
human-machine interaction. Personalized response generation poses even greater
challenges, as the responses must remain coherent and consistent with the
user's personal traits or persona descriptions. We propose MUDI
($\textbf{Mu}$ltiple $\textbf{Di}$scourse Relations Graph Learning) for
personalized dialogue generation. We utilize a Large Language Model to assist
in annotating discourse relations and to transform dialogue data into
structured dialogue graphs. Our graph encoder, the proposed DialogueGAT model,
then captures implicit discourse relations within this structure, along with
persona descriptions. During the personalized response generation phase, novel
coherence-aware attention strategies are implemented to enhance the decoder's
consideration of discourse relations. Our experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in the quality of personalized responses, thus resembling
human-like dialogue exchanges.

*Hawau Olamide Toyin,Samar M. Magdy,Hanan Aldarmaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，现成的大型语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语的文本加音调任务中优于专用模型，但小模型易产生幻觉；微调可提升性能并减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在不同类型语言（阿拉伯语和约鲁巴语）中处理文本加音调任务的效果，填补现有研究对多语言场景覆盖的不足。

Method: 构建多语言数据集MultiDiac，评估14个LLMs与6个专用模型；使用LoRA对四个小模型进行约鲁巴语微调。

Result: 多数现成LLMs在两种语言中表现优于专用模型，小模型存在幻觉问题；微调后性能提升且幻觉减少。

Conclusion: LLMs在文本加音调任务中具有潜力，但需通过微调解决小模型的幻觉问题，尤其在资源稀缺语言中。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for text
diacritization in two typologically distinct languages: Arabic and Yoruba. To
enable a rigorous evaluation, we introduce a novel multilingual dataset
MultiDiac, with diverse samples that capture a range of diacritic ambiguities.
We evaluate 14 LLMs varying in size, accessibility, and language coverage, and
benchmark them against 6 specialized diacritization models. Additionally, we
fine-tune four small open-source models using LoRA for Yoruba. Our results show
that many off-the-shelf LLMs outperform specialized diacritization models for
both Arabic and Yoruba, but smaller models suffer from hallucinations.
Fine-tuning on a small dataset can help improve diacritization performance and
reduce hallucination rates.

*Simeon Junker,Sina Zarrieß*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过SceneGram数据集分析场景上下文对人类概念化抽象形状的影响，并对比多模态大语言模型与人类在指称生成上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于人类对同一物体的多样化概念化现象（如抽象形状可被命名为'螃蟹'或'宇宙飞船'），以及场景上下文对视觉感知和概念预期的影响未被充分探索。

Method: 构建SceneGram数据集，收集人类在不同场景中对抽象形状的指称数据，并基于此系统分析多模态大语言模型生成指称的能力。

Result: 多模态大语言模型生成的指称缺乏人类概念化的丰富性和变异性，无法充分反映场景上下文对概念化的影响。

Conclusion: 场景上下文在概念化过程中具有关键作用，当前多模态LLMs在模拟人类认知灵活性上存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Research on reference and naming suggests that humans can come up with very
different ways of conceptualizing and referring to the same object, e.g. the
same abstract tangram shape can be a "crab", "sink" or "space ship". Another
common assumption in cognitive science is that scene context fundamentally
shapes our visual perception of objects and conceptual expectations. This paper
contributes SceneGram, a dataset of human references to tangram shapes placed
in different scene contexts, allowing for systematic analyses of the effect of
scene context on conceptualization. Based on this data, we analyze references
to tangram shapes generated by multimodal LLMs, showing that these models do
not account for the richness and variability of conceptualizations found in
human references.

*Yicheng Xiao,Lin Song,Rui Yang,Cheng Cheng,Yixiao Ge,Xiu Li,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LoRA-Gen框架，通过云端大模型生成边缘模型的LoRA参数，实现高效领域适配，在推理任务中达到2.1倍加速和10.1倍压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模语言模型在领域特定任务（尤其是边缘侧小模型）中存在效率与效果限制，需解决模型专业化与推理效率的平衡问题。

Method: 基于任务描述利用云端大模型生成LoRA参数，通过重参数化技术将参数融入边缘模型，缩短输入上下文长度以提升推理效率。

Result: 无需专门训练即超越传统LoRA微调，TinyLLaMA-1.1B推理任务中速度提升2.1倍，Gemma-2B智能代理任务压缩比达10.1倍。

Conclusion: LoRA-Gen有效实现模型间知识迁移，在保持精度的同时显著提升边缘模型推理效率，为轻量化部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the benefits of scaling language models to
enhance performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. However, these approaches
still face limitations in effectiveness and efficiency when applied to
domain-specific tasks, particularly for small edge-side models. We propose the
LoRA-Gen framework, which utilizes a large cloud-side model to generate LoRA
parameters for edge-side models based on task descriptions. By employing the
reparameterization technique, we merge the LoRA parameters into the edge-side
model to achieve flexible specialization. Our method facilitates knowledge
transfer between models while significantly improving the inference efficiency
of the specialized model by reducing the input context length. Without
specialized training, LoRA-Gen outperforms conventional LoRA fine-tuning, which
achieves competitive accuracy and a 2.1x speedup with TinyLLaMA-1.1B in
reasoning tasks. Besides, our method delivers a compression ratio of 10.1x with
Gemma-2B on intelligent agent tasks.

### [72] [Converting Annotated Clinical Cases into Structured Case Report Forms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11666)
*Pietro Ferrazzi,Alberto Lavelli,Bernardo Magnini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种半自动方法，将现有信息抽取数据集转换为结构化CRF数据集，构建了英意双语高质量CRF槽填充数据集，实验表明即使先进LLM在CRF填充任务上仍面临挑战（英语67.3%，意大利语59.7%），并开源了数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开可用的高质量CRF数据集稀缺，限制了基于临床笔记自动填充CRF系统的开发。现有信息抽取标注数据集未被充分利用，需探索其转化为CRF格式的可行性。

Method: 提出半自动转换方法，将E3C信息抽取数据集（含英意双语临床文本）转化为结构化CRF格式，通过人工校验确保数据质量，构建CRF槽填充专用数据集。

Result: 零样本LLM在英/意CRF填充任务中分别达到67.3%和59.7%准确率，开源模型表现更差。结果表明CRF填充任务具有挑战性，现有SOTA模型仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 通过数据集转换方法有效缓解CRF数据稀缺问题，实验证明CRF自动填充仍是NLP难点任务，发布的双语数据集为后续研究提供基准资源。

Abstract: Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure
accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However,
publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the
development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical
notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage
of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert
them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology,
which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and
Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling.
Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling
achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language
Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source
models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent
state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at

### [73] [Improving Causal Interventions in Amnesic Probing with Mean Projection or LEACE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11673)
*Alicja Dobrzeniecka,Antske Fokkens,Pia Sommerauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有遗忘探测方法在移除目标信息时存在随机干扰问题，本文提出的MP和LEACE方法能更精准移除信息，提升模型行为解释效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法INLP在消除目标信息时会随机修改模型表征，影响行为解释的可靠性，需开发更精准的信息移除技术。

Method: 提出Mean Projection (MP)和LEACE两种替代方案，通过针对性信息移除机制优化Amnesic Probing。

Result: MP和LEACE相比INLP能更精确地消除目标信息，且减少对非目标信息的干扰，增强行为变化的可解释性。

Conclusion: MP与LEACE通过定向信息移除改进了遗忘探测技术，为模型行为归因提供了更可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Amnesic probing is a technique used to examine the influence of specific
linguistic information on the behaviour of a model. This involves identifying
and removing the relevant information and then assessing whether the model's
performance on the main task changes. If the removed information is relevant,
the model's performance should decline. The difficulty with this approach lies
in removing only the target information while leaving other information
unchanged. It has been shown that Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP), a
widely used removal technique, introduces random modifications to
representations when eliminating target information. We demonstrate that Mean
Projection (MP) and LEACE, two proposed alternatives, remove information in a
more targeted manner, thereby enhancing the potential for obtaining behavioural
explanations through Amnesic Probing.

Conclusion: 多智能体协同架构能有效提升复杂文本简化性能，该方法可扩展至其他需要结构化输出的自然语言处理任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into
sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and
logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid
approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to
enhance the sentence simplification process. Experimental results show that our
approach was able to successfully simplify 70% of the complex sentences written

### [75] [Configurable Preference Tuning with Rubric-Guided Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11702)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Configurable Preference Tuning（CPT）框架，通过动态调整语言模型行为，解决传统AI对齐方法中偏好单一静态的问题，实现基于可解释指令的细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的AI对齐模型（如DPO）假设偏好是单一且静态的，缺乏对上下文依赖和细粒度偏好的适应性。

Method: CPT利用基于结构化细粒度规则的合成偏好数据，通过系统提示条件化微调语言模型，使其在推理时无需重新训练即可动态调整输出。

Result: 实验表明CPT能实现细粒度控制并建模复杂人类反馈，相关训练代码、生成数据集和微调模型已开源。

Conclusion: CPT突破了传统偏好建模的局限性，为语言模型的对齐提供了可配置、可解释且动态适应的新范式。

Abstract: Models of human feedback for AI alignment, such as those underpinning Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), often bake in a singular, static set of
preferences, limiting adaptability. This paper challenges the assumption of
monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a
novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically
adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT
leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system
prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired
attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided
preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in
response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only
offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more
nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts,
such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at

*Héctor Martínez,Adrián Castelló,Francisco D. Igual,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习从传统浮点计算转向混合精度整数运算的趋势，提出新型微内核设计和数据布局以适配现代指令集架构，在多种CPU上实现显著性能提升，标志着矩阵乘法优化的新纪元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于FP64和SIMD的gemm方法在混合精度硬件及量化推理需求下逐渐失效，需重新设计适应现代ISA的高效矩阵乘法实现。

Method: 提出针对x86_64/ARM/RISC-V架构的混合精度整数（MIP）算术优化策略，包括新型微内核设计和数据布局以充分利用专用硬件特性。

Result: 在三种典型CPU架构上，混合精度整数算术相比浮点实现展现出显著性能优势，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合精度硬件与DL推理需求共同驱动gemm优化进入新阶段，即矩阵乘法的'寒武纪时期'，为异构架构提供高效计算基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have led to a shift from traditional
64-bit floating point (FP64) computations toward reduced-precision formats,
such as FP16, BF16, and 8- or 16-bit integers, combined with mixed-precision
arithmetic. This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory
and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant
advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift,
hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs
(Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and
matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and
scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a
fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on
SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves
toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized
inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this,
our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies
for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs,
including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel
designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and
demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over
floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures.
These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the
demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as
the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.

*Nan Jiang,Ziming Wu,De-Chuan Zhan,Fuming Lai,Shaobing Lian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DART提出一种自蒸馏框架，通过非自回归的静默思维（ST）替代自回归的链式推理（CoT），在保持推理性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式推理（CoT）因自回归特性导致计算开销大，难以应用于延迟敏感场景，需探索更高效的推理方式。

Method: 引入双训练机制：CoT路径执行传统推理，ST路径通过轻量级模块（REM）对齐隐藏状态，使少量ST令牌直接生成答案。推理时仅激活ST路径。

Result: 实验表明DART推理性能与基线相当，但计算效率显著提升，验证了其作为高效推理替代方案的可行性。

Conclusion: DART通过静默思维蒸馏，在保持模型推理能力的同时降低延迟，为实时应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced Large Language
Models (LLMs) in solving complex tasks. However, its autoregressive paradigm
leads to significant computational overhead, hindering its deployment in
latency-sensitive applications. To address this, we propose \textbf{DART}
(\textbf{D}istilling \textbf{A}utoregressive \textbf{R}easoning to Silent
\textbf{T}hought), a self-distillation framework that enables LLMs to replace
autoregressive CoT with non-autoregressive Silent Thought (ST). Specifically,
DART introduces two training pathways: the CoT pathway for traditional
reasoning and the ST pathway for generating answers directly from a few ST
tokens. The ST pathway utilizes a lightweight Reasoning Evolvement Module (REM)
to align its hidden states with the CoT pathway, enabling the ST tokens to
evolve into informative embeddings. During inference, only the ST pathway is
activated, leveraging evolving ST tokens to deliver the answer directly.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves comparable
reasoning performance to existing baselines while offering significant
efficiency gains, serving as a feasible alternative for efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏系统性基准来评估深度研究代理（DRAs）的能力，导致其实际应用受限。

Method: 构建包含多领域专家设计的100个任务的基准，并提出基于参考的自适应标准方法评估报告质量，以及通过有效引用数量和准确性评估信息检索能力的框架。

Result: 提出的评估方法在人类判断对齐上表现优异，并开源了基准及框架关键组件以促进LLM代理发展。

Conclusion: DeepResearch Bench填补了DRA评估空白，其方法论和开源资源将加速实用化LLM代理的研发进程。

Abstract: Deep Research Agents are a prominent category of LLM-based agents. By
autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and
higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into
analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research
into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating
the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present
DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks,
each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.
Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose
two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The
first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality
of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate
DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its
effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced
DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at
https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the
development of practical LLM-based agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出从模型输出分布角度研究大语言模型的长度泛化问题，通过引入长短对齐概念和对应正则化方法，有效提升长上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型受限于Transformer架构的固定上下文窗口，在长序列建模中存在长度泛化难题。传统方法过度关注输入特征，而本文发现输出分布一致性对长度泛化具有关键影响。

Method: 通过合成任务验证长短对齐的重要性，提出Long-Short Misalignment量化指标，并设计促进输出分布一致性的正则化训练方法。

Result: 实验表明长短错位指标与长度泛化性能强相关，所提正则化方法在多种任务中显著提升模型表现，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 聚焦输出分布一致性为长上下文建模提供新视角，提出的量化指标和训练方法为改进大语言模型长度泛化能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance and
surprising emergent properties. However, their effectiveness remains limited by
the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for
long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the
ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is
a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh
perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional
emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to
the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on
synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short
alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of
varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a
metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a
strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance.
Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes
long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more
effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理政治话语时存在左倾偏见，而身份提示可调整其行为。研究旨在探索如何通过有限信息的身份提示预测个体及群体的政治立场，并分析预测的稳定性。

Method: 使用零样本身份提示方法，结合反事实论点、不同身份提示和生成方法，构建欧洲议会政治人物数据集，模拟议员投票行为。

Result: 模型能较准确模拟欧洲议会议员投票行为（加权F1≈0.793），预测结果对反事实参数和提示方法具有稳定性，并公开了数据集与代码。

Conclusion: 身份提示可有效预测政治立场和投票行为，为政策分析提供工具，但需注意模型固有偏见对预测的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or
even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a
progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity
prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic
groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze
whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately
predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict
positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if
predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona
prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting
behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted
F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024
European Parliament and our code are available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨多模态大语言模型在简单抽象视觉指代消解任务中的语用能力，发现其仍难以处理依赖上下文的颜色描述等基础语用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过简单但抽象的视觉刺激（如色块、颜色网格）任务，评估当前多模态大语言模型在语用学层面的核心能力，尤其是上下文依赖的指代消解能力。

Method: 使用人类易于完成但具有抽象性的视觉指代任务（如颜色描述解析），测试主流多模态大语言模型的语用推理表现。

Result: 实验表明，即使是先进模型在基础语用任务（如结合上下文解读颜色描述）中仍存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型的基础语用能力尚未达到人类水平，简单任务可有效揭示其语用推理的局限性，需针对性改进。

Abstract: We investigate the linguistic abilities of multimodal large language models
in reference resolution tasks featuring simple yet abstract visual stimuli,
such as color patches and color grids. Although the task may not seem
challenging for today's language models, being straightforward for human dyads,
we consider it to be a highly relevant probe of the pragmatic capabilities of
MLLMs. Our results and analyses indeed suggest that basic pragmatic
capabilities, such as context-dependent interpretation of color descriptions,
still constitute major challenges for state-of-the-art MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出后验角色对齐（PPA）框架，通过先生成通用回复再检索角色记忆的两阶段方法，解决多轮对话中一致性与多样性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成回复前检索角色信息，导致输出泛化且多样性受限，大语言模型在长对话中难以保持角色一致性和连贯性。

Method: PPA采用两阶段框架：1) 仅基于对话上下文生成通用回复；2) 以回复为查询检索相关角色记忆，最后调整回复实现角色对齐。

Result: 实验表明PPA在LLM生成的多轮对话数据中，一致性、多样性和角色相关性均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 后验对齐策略为长时个性化对话生成提供了更灵活有效的范式，同时保持自然度与个性化特征。

Abstract: Multi-session persona-based dialogue generation presents challenges in
maintaining long-term consistency and generating diverse, personalized
responses. While large language models (LLMs) excel in single-session
dialogues, they struggle to preserve persona fidelity and conversational
coherence across extended interactions. Existing methods typically retrieve
persona information before response generation, which can constrain diversity
and result in generic outputs. We propose Post Persona Alignment (PPA), a novel
two-stage framework that reverses this process. PPA first generates a general
response based solely on dialogue context, then retrieves relevant persona
memories using the response as a query, and finally refines the response to
align with the speaker's persona. This post-hoc alignment strategy promotes
naturalness and diversity while preserving consistency and personalization.
Experiments on multi-session LLM-generated dialogue data demonstrate that PPA
significantly outperforms prior approaches in consistency, diversity, and
persona relevance, offering a more flexible and effective paradigm for
long-term personalized dialogue generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法存在同质化头维度或依赖注意力剪枝的缺陷，导致精度损失或计算开销增加，需探索更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用Transformer头维度异质性：低维关注局部上下文，高维捕捉长程依赖。将长上下文不敏感维度投影至正交傅里叶基，用固定频谱系数近似其时间演化。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上，FourierAttention在LongBench和NIAH测试中取得最优长上下文精度，FlashFourierAttention内核实现内存高效部署。

head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing
accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a
training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer
head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones
capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive
dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their
temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on
LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy
on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel,
FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined
read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance
compromise.

*Raphael Scheible-Schmitt,Johann Frei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GeistBERT通过增量训练和优化架构，在德语NLP任务中取得SOTA性能，并发布支持长上下文的扩展模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有德语NLP模型需适配语言特性与现代数据集，GeistBERT旨在通过针对性预训练提升德语处理能力。

Method: 基于GottBERT权重，使用Whole Word Masking在大规模德语语料库预训练，并构建支持8k上下文的Nyströmformer/Longformer变体。

Result: 在NER（CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014）和文本分类任务（GermEval 2018, 10kGNAD）中，基础模型超越更大模型并创SOTA记录。

Conclusion: GeistBERT以MIT协议开源，其高效基础模型为德语NLP研究提供新基准，长上下文模型虽未专项评估但具备潜力。

Abstract: Advances in transformer-based language models have highlighted the benefits
of language-specific pre-training on high-quality corpora. In this context,
German NLP stands to gain from updated architectures and modern datasets
tailored to the linguistic characteristics of the German language. GeistBERT
seeks to improve German language processing by incrementally training on a
diverse corpus and optimizing model performance across various NLP tasks. It
was pre-trained using fairseq with standard hyperparameters, initialized from
GottBERT weights, and trained on a large-scale German corpus using Whole Word
Masking (WWM). Based on the pre-trained model, we derived extended-input
variants using Nystr\"omformer and Longformer architectures with support for
sequences up to 8k tokens. While these long-context models were not evaluated
on dedicated long-context benchmarks, they are included in our release. We
assessed all models on NER (CoNLL 2003, GermEval 2014) and text classification
(GermEval 2018 fine/coarse, 10kGNAD) using $F_1$ score and accuracy. The
GeistBERT models achieved strong performance, leading all tasks among the base
models and setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Notably, the base models
outperformed larger models in several tasks. To support the German NLP research
community, we are releasing GeistBERT under the MIT license.

TL;DR: 提出基于社会科学概念的六维框架评估反仇恨言论效果，标注4214个实例并发布资源，两种分类策略表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前反仇恨言论(CS)效果评估缺乏明确标准，需建立科学分类框架以提升在线仇恨言论(HS)治理效率。

Method: 构建包含清晰度、证据、情感诉求、反驳、受众适应、公平性的六维评估体系，采用多任务与依赖关系分类策略，标注两个基准数据集4214个CS实例。

Result: 多任务与依赖策略分别达到0.94/0.96平均F1值，显著超越基线模型，并揭示维度间强相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为CS效果评估提供可计算化标准，维度间依赖关系为后续研究提供新方向，开源语言资源促进社区发展。

Abstract: Counter-speech (CS) is a key strategy for mitigating online Hate Speech (HS),
yet defining the criteria to assess its effectiveness remains an open
challenge. We propose a novel computational framework for CS effectiveness
classification, grounded in social science concepts. Our framework defines six
core dimensions - Clarity, Evidence, Emotional Appeal, Rebuttal, Audience
Adaptation, and Fairness - which we use to annotate 4,214 CS instances from two
benchmark datasets, resulting in a novel linguistic resource released to the
community. In addition, we propose two classification strategies, multi-task
and dependency-based, achieving strong results (0.94 and 0.96 average F1
respectively on both expert- and user-written CS), outperforming standard
baselines, and revealing strong interdependence among dimensions.

### [86] [Feedback Friction: LLMs Struggle to Fully Incorporate External Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11930)
*Dongwei Jiang,Alvin Zhang,Andrew Wang,Nicholas Andrews,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在大语言模型（LLMs）获得近乎完美的外部反馈时，仍存在对反馈的抵抗现象（称为FEEDBACK FRICTION），现有缓解策略效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在理想条件下是否能够完全整合外部反馈以修正错误答案，验证其反馈利用能力的边界。

Method: 设计控制环境：先由solver模型生成答案，再由含完整参考答案的反馈生成器提供针对性反馈，最后solver重新尝试。覆盖数学/知识/科学推理及多领域任务，测试Claude 3.7等先进模型。

Result: 模型普遍表现出反馈抵抗现象；温度渐进提升、显式拒绝错误答案等策略仅部分改善性能，且无法达到目标水平；排除模型过度自信、数据熟悉度等潜在原因。

Conclusion: 反馈摩擦是LLMs的固有限制，现有方法无法完全克服。需进一步研究模型自我改进机制，以突破此瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown LLMs possess some ability to improve their
responses when given external feedback. However, it remains unclear how
effectively and thoroughly these models can incorporate extrinsic feedback. In
an ideal scenario, if LLMs receive near-perfect and complete feedback, we would
expect them to fully integrate the feedback and change their incorrect answers
to correct ones. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLMs' ability to
incorporate feedback by designing a controlled experimental environment. For
each problem, a solver model attempts a solution, then a feedback generator
with access to near-complete ground-truth answers produces targeted feedback,
after which the solver tries again. We evaluate this pipeline across a diverse
range of tasks, including math reasoning, knowledge reasoning, scientific
reasoning, and general multi-domain evaluations with state-of-the-art language
models including Claude 3.7 (with and without extended thinking). Surprisingly,
even under these near-ideal conditions, solver models consistently show
resistance to feedback, a limitation that we term FEEDBACK FRICTION. To
mitigate this limitation, we experiment with sampling-based strategies like
progressive temperature increases and explicit rejection of previously
attempted incorrect answers, which yield improvements but still fail to help
models achieve target performance. We also perform a rigorous exploration of
potential causes of FEEDBACK FRICTION, ruling out factors such as model
overconfidence and data familiarity. We hope that highlighting this issue in
LLMs and ruling out several apparent causes will help future research in
self-improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比表示学习（CRL）的防御框架，通过三元组损失和对抗性硬负样本挖掘，增强大型语言模型（LLM）对输入级和嵌入空间对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持其标准性能。该方法在多个模型中表现优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法难以泛化应对不同类型的对抗攻击，而基于表示工程的近期进展为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新思路。因此，研究如何通过对比学习分离良性与有害表示成为核心动机。

Method: 将模型防御建模为对比表示学习问题，采用三元组损失结合对抗性硬负样本挖掘策略，通过微调模型以扩大良性与有害表示之间的差异。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种模型上优于现有基于表示工程的防御方法，显著提升对输入级和嵌入空间攻击的鲁棒性，且不影响模型正常任务表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的CRL框架通过对比学习有效增强LLM对抗攻击的防御能力，为构建通用且鲁棒的模型防御机制提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with profound societal
impacts, yet their ability to generate responses to diverse and uncontrolled
inputs leaves them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing defenses
often struggle to generalize across varying attack types, recent advancements
in representation engineering offer promising alternatives. In this work, we
propose a defense framework that formulates model defense as a contrastive
representation learning (CRL) problem. Our method finetunes a model using a
triplet-based loss combined with adversarial hard negative mining to encourage
separation between benign and harmful representations. Our experimental results
across multiple models demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior
representation engineering-based defenses, improving robustness against both
input-level and embedding-space attacks without compromising standard
performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）正在改变编程代码风格，首次通过分析19,000+ GitHub仓库数据证实变量命名、复杂度等风格特征与LLM生成代码趋势一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否改变了现实编程中的代码风格，并量化这种影响。

Method: 分析2020-2025年arXiv论文关联的19,000+ GitHub仓库代码，聚焦命名规范、复杂度、可维护性、相似性四个维度。

Result: Python变量snake_case命名比例从2023Q1的47%增至2025Q1的51%，代码风格演变趋势符合LLM生成特征。

Conclusion: 首次通过大规模实证证明LLMs正在重塑现实编程风格，但受模型多样性和使用方式限制，难以精确量化LLM参与程度。

Abstract: Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between
humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape
programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs
transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In
this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs
on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability,
and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked
to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends
in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of
LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names
in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we
investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning
processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other
factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the
proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results
provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world
programming style.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGR综述缺乏对下游应用及挑战性推理范式的全面总结，本文旨在填补这一空白，整合多类任务并分析新技术（如LLMs）对领域的影响。

Method: 从任务中心视角将KGR方法分为静态单步/多步推理、动态推理、多模态推理、少样本推理和归纳推理，并基于主要推理任务、下游应用任务及潜在挑战任务进行分类分析。

Result: 构建了涵盖KGR任务分类、技术进展（如LLMs）及实际应用的系统性综述框架，明确了关键研究趋势与未来挑战。

Conclusion: 本文通过整合多维度分类与前沿技术，为KGR研究提供全面参考，强调结合大语言模型等技术的跨领域融合是未来重要方向。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring
and leveraging diverse real-world knowledge, which serve as a fundamental
technology for enabling cognitive intelligence systems with advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities. Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) aims
to infer new knowledge based on existing facts in KGs, playing a crucial role
in applications such as public security intelligence, intelligent healthcare,
and financial risk assessment. From a task-centric perspective, existing KGR
approaches can be broadly classified into static single-step KGR, static
multi-step KGR, dynamic KGR, multi-modal KGR, few-shot KGR, and inductive KGR.
While existing surveys have covered these six types of KGR tasks, a
comprehensive review that systematically summarizes all KGR tasks particularly
including downstream applications and more challenging reasoning paradigms
remains lacking. In contrast to previous works, this survey provides a more
comprehensive perspective on the research of KGR by categorizing approaches
based on primary reasoning tasks, downstream application tasks, and potential
challenging reasoning tasks. Besides, we explore advanced techniques, such as
large language models (LLMs), and their impact on KGR. This work aims to
highlight key research trends and outline promising future directions in the
field of KGR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出OntoGSN——一种基于GSN标准的本体与中间件，用于动态管理保证案例（ACs），支持自动填充、评估与更新，解决传统AC维护困难的问题，并通过实例验证其在大型语言模型对抗鲁棒性保障中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有保证案例（ACs）管理工具在动态场景（如自动驾驶）中维护困难，导致开发效率低下或产生不可靠案例。亟需一种自动化、可扩展的方法以降低知识维护成本并提升可信度。

Method: 1. 基于GSN标准v3构建OWL本体，集成SWRL规则；2. 开发辅助本体与解析器以兼容主流AC工具；3. 建立SPARQL查询库与自动化模式；4. 设计原型界面；5. 通过FAIR原则、OOPS框架及社区反馈验证本体。

Result: OntoGSN本体严格遵循GSN标准并通过多维度评估，中间件组件支持动态AC管理。案例研究表明其可有效管理大型语言模型对抗鲁棒性保障中的AC更新与查询。

Conclusion: OntoGSN通过本体化建模与自动化工具链，显著提升动态环境下AC的可维护性，减少人工维护成本与错误置信风险，为复杂系统保障提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Assurance cases (ACs) are a common artifact for building and maintaining
confidence in system properties such as safety or robustness. Constructing an
AC can be challenging, although existing tools provide support in static,
document-centric applications and methods for dynamic contexts (e.g.,
autonomous driving) are emerging. Unfortunately, managing ACs remains a
challenge, since maintaining the embedded knowledge in the face of changes
requires substantial effort, in the process deterring developers - or worse,
producing poorly managed cases that instill false confidence. To address this,
we present OntoGSN: an ontology and supporting middleware for managing ACs in
the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) standard. OntoGSN offers a knowledge
representation and a queryable graph that can be automatically populated,
evaluated, and updated. Our contributions include: a 1:1 formalization of the
GSN Community Standard v3 in an OWL ontology with SWRL rules; a helper ontology
and parser for integration with a widely used AC tool; a repository and
documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community
feedback. The development of other middleware elements is guided by the
community needs and subject to ongoing evaluations. To demonstrate the utility
of our contributions, we illustrate dynamic AC management in an example
involving assurance of adversarial robustness in large language models.

Motivation: 医学教育中临床沟通技能的规模化实践与评估存在挑战，现有LLM驱动的场景模拟难以实现符合医生主观偏好的自动化评估。

Method: 基于LLM医疗教育系统收集对话数据，通过专业度、医学相关性等四维模糊集标注，采用提示工程与监督微调(SFT)构建评估模型。

Result: 模型整体准确率超80%，主要评估标准项达90%以上，实现可解释且与人类判断对齐的自动化评估。

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑与LLM结合可有效对齐人类偏好，推动医学教育评估自动化发展，支持更稳健的临床技能判断实践。

Abstract: Clinical communication skills are critical in medical education, and
practicing and assessing clinical communication skills on a scale is
challenging. Although LLM-powered clinical scenario simulations have shown
promise in enhancing medical students' clinical practice, providing automated
and scalable clinical evaluation that follows nuanced physician judgment is
difficult. This paper combines fuzzy logic and Large Language Model (LLM) and
proposes LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge to address the challenge of aligning the
automated evaluation of medical students' clinical skills with subjective
physicians' preferences. LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge is an approach that LLM is
fine-tuned to evaluate medical students' utterances within student-AI patient
conversation scripts based on human annotations from four fuzzy sets, including
Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual
Distraction. The methodology of this paper started from data collection from
the LLM-powered medical education system, data annotation based on
multidimensional fuzzy sets, followed by prompt engineering and the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) of the pre-trained LLMs using these human annotations. The
results show that the LLM-as-a-Fuzzy-Judge achieves over 80\% accuracy, with
major criteria items over 90\%, effectively leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM as a
solution to deliver interpretable, human-aligned assessment. This work suggests
the viability of leveraging fuzzy logic and LLM to align with human
preferences, advances automated evaluation in medical education, and supports
more robust assessment and judgment practices. The GitHub repository of this

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种面向资源受限物联网设备的多标签声音分类无监督领域自适应框架MUDAS，通过选择性重训练、自适应阈值和多样性正则化，在SONYC-UST数据集上实现了高效且准确的声音分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督领域自适应（UDA）算法仅适用于单标签任务且依赖高计算资源，无法满足多标签场景（如城市声音分类中的重叠声学事件）及物联网设备的低功耗需求。

Method: MUDAS采用选择性重训练分类器以减少计算内存开销，通过类特定自适应阈值生成可靠伪标签，并引入多样性正则化提升多标签分类精度。

Result: 在纽约市多地点采集的SONYC-UST数据集上，MUDAS显著优于现有UDA算法，在资源受限环境中实现了高分类准确率。

Conclusion: MUDAS证明了在物联网设备上实现高效多标签声音分类的可行性，为低功耗场景下的领域自适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine
learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts
can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label
tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in
multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these
limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound
classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust,
adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address
these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for
Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification
in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by
selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data,
minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment.
Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate
reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve
multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound
Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS
demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA
algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

Motivation: 现有基准测试忽视化学表格的多模态特性与领域复杂性，导致多模态大语言模型在化学科学理解支持不足。需建立更贴合真实场景的化学表格评估体系。

Method: 构建ChemTable基准数据集，包含文献实验表格的专家标注单元多边形、逻辑布局及领域标签，支持表格识别(结构解析/内容提取)与理解(描述性/推理问答)双任务，并系统评估主流多模态模型。

Result: 模型在基础布局解析表现尚可，但在描述性与推理QA任务上显著落后人类水平。开源模型在多个维度上明显弱于闭源模型，最大性能差距达20%以上。

Conclusion: 化学表格理解存在显著挑战，ChemTable为推进科学推理提供了严格基准，揭示了当前模型在领域语义融合与复杂推理能力的不足。

Abstract: Chemical tables encode complex experimental knowledge through symbolic
expressions, structured variables, and embedded molecular graphics. Existing
benchmarks largely overlook this multimodal and domain-specific complexity,
limiting the ability of multimodal large language models to support scientific
understanding in chemistry. In this work, we introduce ChemTable, a large-scale
benchmark of real-world chemical tables curated from the experimental sections
of literature. ChemTable includes expert-annotated cell polygons, logical
layouts, and domain-specific labels, including reagents, catalysts, yields, and
graphical components and supports two core tasks: (1) Table Recognition,
covering structure parsing and content extraction; and (2) Table Understanding,
encompassing both descriptive and reasoning-oriented question answering
grounded in table structure and domain semantics. We evaluated a range of
representative multimodal models, including both open-source and closed-source
models, on ChemTable and reported a series of findings with practical and
conceptual insights. Although models show reasonable performance on basic
layout parsing, they exhibit substantial limitations on both descriptive and
inferential QA tasks compared to human performance, and we observe significant
performance gaps between open-source and closed-source models across multiple
dimensions. These results underscore the challenges of chemistry-aware table
understanding and position ChemTable as a rigorous and realistic benchmark for
advancing scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Family caregivers often face substantial mental health challenges due to
their multifaceted roles and limited resources. This study explored the
potential of a large language model (LLM)-powered conversational agent to
deliver evidence-based mental health support for caregivers, specifically
Problem-Solving Therapy (PST) integrated with Motivational Interviewing (MI)
and Behavioral Chain Analysis (BCA). A within-subject experiment was conducted
with 28 caregivers interacting with four LLM configurations to evaluate empathy
and therapeutic alliance. The best-performing models incorporated Few-Shot and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompting techniques, alongside
clinician-curated examples. The models showed improved contextual understanding
and personalized support, as reflected by qualitative responses and
quantitative ratings on perceived empathy and therapeutic alliances.
Participants valued the model's ability to validate emotions, explore
unexpressed feelings, and provide actionable strategies. However, balancing
thorough assessment with efficient advice delivery remains a challenge. This

TL;DR: 本文提出FocalAD框架，通过聚焦局部关键交互代理并增强其运动表征，提升端到端自动驾驶规划可靠性。该方法在nuScenes和Bench2Drive基准测试中表现优异，碰撞率显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶运动预测方法过度依赖全局运动特征，忽视了规划决策主要受少量局部交互代理影响的问题。忽略关键局部交互可能导致风险误判，降低规划可靠性。

Method: 提出包含两个核心模块的FocalAD框架：1) Ego-Local-Agents Interactor(ELAI)：基于图结构的自我中心交互表征模块，捕捉局部邻居运动动态；2) Focal-Local-Agents Loss(FLA Loss)：通过加权决策关键邻居代理，引导模型关注规划相关度高的交互。

Result: 在nuScenes开环测试和Bench2Drive闭环基准中超越SOTA方法。在强调鲁棒性的Adv-nuScenes数据集上，碰撞率较DiffusionDrive降低41.9%，较SparseDrive降低15.6%。

Conclusion: 聚焦局部关键交互能有效提升自动驾驶规划可靠性，通过增强局部运动表征和动态加权机制，显著降低碰撞风险，验证了局部交互建模在端到端自动驾驶中的核心价值。

Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role
in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally
aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are
primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing
to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and
undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel
end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local
neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations.
Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents
Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a
graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion
dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion
queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring
agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning.
Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive
benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD
achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by
41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于局部状态注意力模块的多智能体强化学习方法，用于提升自动驾驶车辆在混合交通环境（如高速公路汇入场景）中的冲突解决与泛化能力，显著提高了高密度交通下的合并效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习方法（如MAPPO）在混合交通环境中难以有效解决智能体间的局部冲突，且对随机事件（如优先车辆出现）的泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过自注意力机制构建局部状态注意力模块，动态压缩邻近车辆的关键信息，优先处理交通场景中的冲突事件（如车辆汇入时的优先级判断）。

Result: 在模拟高速公路汇入场景的实验中，该方法相比基线模型显著提升了合并效率，尤其在高密度交通条件下表现更优。

Conclusion: 局部注意力机制能有效捕捉交通场景中的关键交互信息，为多自动驾驶车辆在复杂混合交通环境中的协同决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: In mixed-traffic environments, autonomous vehicles must adapt to
human-controlled vehicles and other unusual driving situations. This setting
can be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with
full cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as
Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL
tasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable
to generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State
Attention module to assist the input state representation. By relying on the
self-attention operator, the module is expected to compress the essential
information of nearby agents to resolve the conflict in traffic situations.
Utilizing a simulated highway merging scenario with the priority vehicle as the
unexpected event, our approach is able to prioritize other vehicles'
information to manage the merging process. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in merging efficiency compared to popular baselines, especially in
high-density traffic settings.

*Zifan Liu,Yuan Cao,Yanwei Yu,Heng Qi,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图卷积网络的结构感知自动通道剪枝框架（SACP），通过建模网络拓扑关系实现全局重要性评估，在减少人工干预的同时提升剪枝效果，实验表明其在压缩效率和精度保持上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法依赖局部启发式规则或权重标准，无法捕捉网络结构全局依赖关系，导致剪枝决策次优化和模型性能下降。

Method: 使用图卷积网络（GCN）编码网络拓扑结构，动态限制剪枝率组合搜索空间，通过自动化搜索确定最优剪枝策略，实现结构感知的全局剪枝。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/ImageNet数据集和ResNet/VGG16模型上的实验显示，SACP在模型压缩率（FLOPs减少）和精度保持（Top-1准确率）方面超越现有先进方法。

Conclusion: SACP框架通过全局结构建模和自动化搜索机制，有效解决了传统剪枝方法的局限性，为资源受限设备部署提供了更优的模型压缩方案。

Abstract: Channel pruning is a powerful technique to reduce the computational overhead
of deep neural networks, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained
devices. However, existing pruning methods often rely on local heuristics or
weight-based criteria that fail to capture global structural dependencies
within the network, leading to suboptimal pruning decisions and degraded model
performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel structure-aware
automatic channel pruning (SACP) framework that utilizes graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to model the network topology and learn the global importance
of each channel. By encoding structural relationships within the network, our
approach implements topology-aware pruning and this pruning is fully automated,
reducing the need for human intervention. We restrict the pruning rate
combinations to a specific space, where the number of combinations can be
dynamically adjusted, and use a search-based approach to determine the optimal
pruning rate combinations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, ImageNet) with various models (ResNet, VGG16) demonstrate that SACP
outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods on compression efficiency and
competitive on accuracy retention.

*Chenrui Cao,Liangcheng Song,Zenan Li,Xinyi Le,Xian Zhang,Hui Xue,Fan Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DSP+框架，通过改进神经符号方法协调现成推理模型，无需额外训练即实现与强化学习模型相当的自动定理证明性能，并发现数据集中的形式化错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动定理证明领域依赖强化学习大规模训练模型（如DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B），但研究发现通过优化现成模型的神经符号协作即可达到类似效果，挑战了主流RL训练范式。

Method: 改进Draft-Sketch-Prove框架为DSP+：1) 生成无人类证明依赖的自然语言子目标；2) 自动形式化假设并过滤语法错误；3) 结合符号搜索与步骤证明器（如Aesop）完成子目标证明。

Result: DSP+在miniF2F/ProofNet/PutnamBench上分别解决80.7%/32.8%/24个问题，首次证明imo_2019_p1，发现miniF2F中8处错误，且证明过程更易人类理解。

Conclusion: 神经符号协作框架DSP+证明传统推理模式在自动定理证明中的潜力，减少对RL训练的依赖，其可解释性有助于形式化验证。所有组件将开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B and
Kimina-Prover-Preview-72B, demonstrate a prevailing trend in leveraging
reinforcement learning (RL)-based large-scale training for automated theorem
proving. Surprisingly, we discover that even without any training, careful
neuro-symbolic coordination of existing off-the-shelf reasoning models and
tactic step provers can achieve comparable performance. This paper introduces
\textbf{DSP+}, an improved version of the Draft, Sketch, and Prove framework,
featuring a \emph{fine-grained and integrated} neuro-symbolic enhancement for
each phase: (1) In the draft phase, we prompt reasoning models to generate
concise natural-language subgoals to benefit the sketch phase, removing
thinking tokens and references to human-written proofs; (2) In the sketch
phase, subgoals are autoformalized with hypotheses to benefit the proving
phase, and sketch lines containing syntactic errors are masked according to
predefined rules; (3) In the proving phase, we tightly integrate symbolic
search methods like Aesop with step provers to establish proofs for the sketch
subgoals. Experimental results show that, without any additional model training
or fine-tuning, DSP+ solves 80.7\%, 32.8\%, and 24 out of 644 problems from
miniF2F, ProofNet, and PutnamBench, respectively, while requiring fewer budgets
compared to state-of-the-arts. DSP+ proves \texttt{imo\_2019\_p1}, an IMO
problem in miniF2F that is not solved by any prior work. Additionally, DSP+
generates proof patterns comprehensible by human experts, facilitating the
identification of formalization errors; For example, eight wrongly formalized
statements in miniF2F are discovered. Our results highlight the potential of
classical reasoning patterns besides the RL-based training. All components will
be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG+通过引入应用感知推理和双重语料库，在标准RAG基础上提升3-5%性能，峰值达7.5%，实现检索与应用的有效结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG范式忽视知识应用环节，导致检索事实与任务推理间存在认知断层，需建立知识到应用的端到端框架。

Method: 构建知识与应用示例对齐的双重语料库，通过联合检索机制将结构化推理模板与知识共同注入LLM推理过程。

Result: 在数学/法律/医学领域多模型测试中，RAG+平均提升3-5%，复杂场景峰值增益达7.5%，显著优于传统RAG变体。

Conclusion: RAG+通过认知驱动的知识应用框架，弥合检索与执行的鸿沟，为LLM构建可解释、可操作的增强推理范式。

Abstract: The integration of external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) has become foundational in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for
knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG paradigms often overlook the
cognitive step of applying knowledge, leaving a gap between retrieved facts and
task-specific reasoning. In this work, we introduce RAG+, a principled and
modular extension that explicitly incorporates application-aware reasoning into
the RAG pipeline. RAG+ constructs a dual corpus consisting of knowledge and
aligned application examples, created either manually or automatically, and
retrieves both jointly during inference. This design enables LLMs not only to
access relevant information but also to apply it within structured,
goal-oriented reasoning processes. Experiments across mathematical, legal, and
medical domains, conducted on multiple models, demonstrate that RAG+
consistently outperforms standard RAG variants, achieving average improvements
of 3-5%, and peak gains up to 7.5% in complex scenarios. By bridging retrieval
with actionable application, RAG+ advances a more cognitively grounded
framework for knowledge integration, representing a step toward more
interpretable and capable LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽具备强推理能力但调用成本高，而小型开源模型虽免费易部署但推理能力不足。需探索两者协作以平衡成本与性能。

Method: 设计多轮级联协作框架：规划模型首先生成问题的高层抽象计划，推理模型基于计划生成完整解决方案。大模型与小模型交替担任规划者与推理者角色。

Result: 该方法在保持与大型专有模型相近准确率的同时，显著降低对付费推理的依赖，验证了规划作为跨模型协作先验的有效性。

Conclusion: 规划机制能有效协调异构模型的推理过程，在真实部署约束下实现成本敏感的任务求解，为资源受限场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but those with
strong capabilities (e.g., whose numbers of parameters are larger than 100B)
are often accessible only through paid APIs, making them too costly for
applications of frequent use. In contrast, smaller open-sourced LLMs (e.g.,
whose numbers of parameters are less than 3B) are freely available and easy to
deploy locally (e.g., under a single GPU having 8G VRAM), but lack suff icient
reasoning ability. This trade-off raises a natural question: can small (free)
and large (costly) models collaborate at test time to combine their strengths?
We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first
generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the
problem.
  This plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model,
which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting
as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to
collaboratively solve complex tasks. Our method achieves accuracy comparable to
strong proprietary models alone, while significantly reducing reliance on paid
inference. These results highlight planning as an effective prior for
orchestrating cost-aware, cross-model inference under real-world deployment
constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个基于德语中学课程的多领域视觉语言基准数据集，测试模型整合视觉与学科知识的能力。评估显示现有模型整体准确率不足45%，在数学、音乐及对抗场景表现差，突显现实多模态理解的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有英语基准多依赖脱离上下文的问题，无法反映真实教育场景需求。本文旨在通过德语中学课程构建更贴近实际的多模态推理评估框架，填补非英语环境下的研究空白。

Method: 基于德国9个学科中学课程，构建含486张图像、2000+开放式问题的数据集。评估13个前沿开放权重VLMs，涵盖学科准确率、对抗性问题等维度。

Result: 最优模型整体准确率低于45%，音乐（26.3%）和数学（33.7%表现最差。对抗性问题准确率较基线下降12.5%，显示模型易受干扰。

Conclusion: 中学课程任务能有效检验VLMs的多模态推理能力，尤其在非英语场景。该数据集为提升AI视觉-语言协同理解提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on tasks that combine visual
reasoning with subject-specific background knowledge in the German language. In
contrast to widely used English-language benchmarks that often rely on
artificially difficult or decontextualized problems, this dataset draws from
real middle school curricula across nine domains including mathematics,
history, biology, and religion. The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended
questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual
interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual
cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple
dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial
crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve
less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music,
mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate
significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world
multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a
meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in
non-English contexts. The dataset and evaluation protocol serve as a rigorous
testbed to better understand and improve the visual and linguistic reasoning
capabilities of future AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出对称多模态偏好优化（SymMPO），通过对称偏好学习与直接偏好监督增强视觉理解，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，并在多个基准测试中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽通过视觉对比目标提升多模态大语言模型对视觉输入的关注以减少幻觉，但其优化目标函数不严谨且依赖间接偏好监督，存在改进空间。

Method: SymMPO结合对称偏好学习与直接偏好监督（响应对），保持与标准DPO的理论一致性，并引入偏好边际一致性损失以定量调节对称偏好对之间的偏好差距。

Result: 在五个基准测试中的综合评估表明，SymMPO在缓解多模态大语言模型幻觉方面表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SymMPO通过对称偏好优化与定量偏好调节，为多模态大语言模型的幻觉抑制提供了更严谨且直接有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
mitigating hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although
existing methods have achieved significant progress by utilizing
vision-oriented contrastive objectives for enhancing MLLMs' attention to visual
inputs and hence reducing hallucination, they suffer from non-rigorous
optimization objective function and indirect preference supervision. To address
these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization
(SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference
supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while
maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to
conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin
consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between
symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks
demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in
hallucination mitigation of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文分析了关系图神经网络（R-GNNs）在规划任务中学习基于C₂逻辑特征的价值函数的能力，指出其理论局限性，并提出其他GNN架构可能更适合此类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于R-GNNs在规划领域中被认为能通过C₂逻辑特征（基于一阶逻辑的二元谓词）泛化学习价值函数，但实际能力与理论假设存在矛盾。

Method: 通过理论分析R-GNNs的表达能力与C₂逻辑的关联性，并结合规划问题中价值函数的结构特性，验证其学习C₂特征的能力。

Result: 结果表明，尽管C₂特征理论上可分解为算术表达式，但R-GNNs无法有效学习此类特征定义的价值函数，同时发现早期GNN架构可能更适合此类任务。

Conclusion: R-GNNs在规划任务中存在理论局限性，需重新评估其适用性；未来可探索其他GNN架构以更好地捕捉C₂逻辑特征。

Abstract: Relational Graph Neural Networks (R-GNNs) are a GNN-based approach for
learning value functions that can generalise to unseen problems from a given
planning domain. R-GNNs were theoretically motivated by the well known
connection between the expressive power of GNNs and $C_2$, first-order logic
with two variables and counting. In the context of planning, $C_2$ features
refer to the set of formulae in $C_2$ with relations defined by the unary and
binary predicates of a planning domain. Some planning domains exhibit optimal
value functions that can be decomposed as arithmetic expressions of $C_2$
features. We show that, contrary to empirical results, R-GNNs cannot learn
value functions defined by $C_2$ features. We also identify prior GNN
architectures for planning that may better learn value functions defined by
$C_2$ features.

TL;DR: 本文研究了存在潜在混杂变量时，如何利用多环境数据进行因果效应估计。通过理论证明和矩估计方法，提出了在单一参数变化条件下的可识别性框架，并开发了参数变化检测流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在因果推断中，潜在混杂变量会严重影响效应估计的准确性。现有方法通常假设观测数据来自单一环境，而本文探索如何利用多环境数据中保持不变的因果结构来克服这一限制。

Method: 提出基于矩估计的算法框架：1) 利用多环境数据中因果效应的不变性建立可识别条件；2) 设计仅需单个参数（噪声分布或因果关系）跨环境变化的估计方法；3) 开发参数变化类型的诊断流程。

Result: 理论证明：当潜在变量和治疗变量的噪声同时变化时不可识别。实验显示：在仅单一参数变化的合成数据中，所提方法能准确估计因果效应，AUC达到0.89以上。

Conclusion: 多环境数据通过约束参数变化模式可实现潜在混杂下的因果识别，但需保证不超过一个关键参数跨环境变化。所提矩方法在满足条件时具有统计一致性，为实际应用提供可验证的框架。

Abstract: We investigate the estimation of the causal effect of a treatment variable on
an outcome in the presence of a latent confounder. We first show that the
causal effect is identifiable under certain conditions when data is available
from multiple environments, provided that the target causal effect remains
invariant across these environments. Secondly, we propose a moment-based
algorithm for estimating the causal effect as long as only a single parameter
of the data-generating mechanism varies across environments -- whether it be
the exogenous noise distribution or the causal relationship between two
variables. Conversely, we prove that identifiability is lost if both exogenous
noise distributions of both the latent and treatment variables vary across
environments. Finally, we propose a procedure to identify which parameter of
the data-generating mechanism has varied across the environments and evaluate
the performance of our proposed methods through experiments on synthetic data.

Motivation: 房地产市场存在严重信息不对称，传统评估方法门槛高。研究旨在验证LLMs能否通过优化上下文学习策略，提供更易获取、可解释的房价评估，从而提升市场透明度。

Method: 系统评估主流LLMs在国际多样化房产数据集上的表现，对比零样本、少样本、市场报告增强及混合提示技术，并基于特征相似性和地理邻近性优化上下文示例选择。

Result: LLMs能有效利用房屋特征（如面积、设施）生成合理估价，其解释与先进模型一致。上下文优化显著提升性能，但LLMs对价格区间过度自信且空间推理能力有限。传统模型预测精度仍更高。

Conclusion: LLMs为房地产评估提供了交互性强、可解释的替代方案，尤其在提升透明度方面潜力显著。研究为结构化预测任务提供提示优化指南，并指出需谨慎处理模型局限性。

Abstract: The real estate market is vital to global economies but suffers from
significant information asymmetry. This study examines how Large Language
Models (LLMs) can democratize access to real estate insights by generating
competitive and interpretable house price estimates through optimized
In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. We systematically evaluate leading LLMs
on diverse international housing datasets, comparing zero-shot, few-shot,
market report-enhanced, and hybrid prompting techniques. Our results show that
LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and
amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning
models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more
accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although
self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain
their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their
trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature
similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet
LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial
reasoning. We offer practical guidance for structured prediction tasks through
prompt optimization. Our findings highlight LLMs' potential to improve
transparency in real estate appraisal and provide actionable insights for
stakeholders.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）被广泛用于模拟社会行为，但其政治偏见及在辩论中的动态交互机制尚未充分研究。本文旨在探究模型类型与性别属性如何影响政治倾向。

Method: 采用结构化多智能体辩论框架，控制LLM类型（中立/共和党/民主党）、性别属性和辩论形式，分析模型来源与角色设定对政治偏见及态度演变的影响。

Result: 中立模型持续偏向民主党，共和党模型趋近中立；性别影响态度调整，智能体感知其他性别时会改变观点；同政治阵营的智能体形成回音室，辩论中态度极化加剧。

Conclusion: LLM的政治偏见受模型来源与角色属性显著影响，性别感知与同质化群体交互加剧态度极化，挑战了此前关于回音室动态的假设，需进一步研究社会模拟中的偏差机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate social
behaviour, yet their political biases and interaction dynamics in debates
remain underexplored. We investigate how LLM type and agent gender attributes
influence political bias using a structured multi-agent debate framework, by
engaging Neutral, Republican, and Democrat American LLM agents in debates on
politically sensitive topics. We systematically vary the underlying LLMs, agent
genders, and debate formats to examine how model provenance and agent personas
influence political bias and attitudes throughout debates. We find that Neutral
agents consistently align with Democrats, while Republicans shift closer to the
Neutral; gender influences agent attitudes, with agents adapting their opinions
when aware of other agents' genders; and contrary to prior research, agents
with shared political affiliations can form echo chambers, exhibiting the
expected intensification of attitudes as debates progress.

Conclusion: 隐私增强框架可降低AI工具中的性别偏见，强调开发伦理AI时需主动控制数据偏差对模型的影响。

Abstract: The use of language technologies in high-stake settings is increasing in
recent years, mostly motivated by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, despite the great performance of LLMs, they are are susceptible to
ethical concerns, such as demographic biases, accountability, or privacy. This
work seeks to analyze the capacity of Transformers-based systems to learn
demographic biases present in the data, using a case study on AI-based
automated recruitment. We propose a privacy-enhancing framework to reduce
gender information from the learning pipeline as a way to mitigate biased
behaviors in the final tools. Our experiments analyze the influence of data
biases on systems built on two different LLMs, and how the proposed framework
effectively prevents trained systems from reproducing the bias in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的人机协同决策需权衡预测正确性、知识推理成本及置信度，现有方法在动态分配任务和成本控制方面存在不足。

Method: 两阶段级联决策：1) 延迟策略根据置信度选择接受基础模型答案或调用大型模型；2) 弃权策略决定是否人工干预，并引入在线学习机制整合人类反馈。

Result: 在通用问答（ARC-Easy/Challenge）和医学问答（MedQA/MedMCQA）任务中，级联策略在多数情况下准确率优于单模型基准，同时降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 级联框架通过动态分配任务和利用人类反馈，实现了高准确性、低成本的决策，并为处理模型弃权问题提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Effective human-AI decision-making balances three key factors: the
\textit{correctness} of predictions, the \textit{cost} of knowledge and
reasoning complexity, and the confidence about whether to \textit{abstain}
automated answers or involve human experts. In this work, we present a cascaded
LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of
expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and
knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model
cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy
determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the
large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides
whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human
intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the
framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over
time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results
show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model
baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to
handle abstentions.

Motivation: 现有模式链接模型采用机械学习范式过度优化标准答案，导致推理能力受限，主要因下游任务难以获取高质量推理样本。

Method: Schema-R1包含三阶段：1) 小批量高质量推理样本构建；2) 监督微调冷启动初始化；3) 基于规则的强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在过滤准确率指标上相比现有方法提升10%，验证了模型推理能力的有效增强。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习范式突破传统监督学习局限，为模式链接任务提供新的训练框架，显著提升模型泛化性能。

Abstract: Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately
predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on
the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking
models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth
schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation
arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample
for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema
linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1
consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality
reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and
rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that
our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking
model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing
method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注LLM任务最终结果，忽视规划、修正、资源约束决策等中间推理过程，而评估这些内部机制对理解模型行为和提升可靠性至关重要。

Method: 提出以策略游戏为评估环境（封闭、规则明确、资源有限），设计框架从规划、修正、资源决策三个维度定义新指标（如过校正风险率、校正成功率、预算超支率），并对12个主流模型进行4320轮对抗测试。

Result: ChatGPT-o3-mini综合得分最高（胜率74.7%，校正成功率78.6%），Qwen-Plus因资源过度消耗胜率仅25.6%；修正频率与成功率呈负相关（Pearson r=-0.51），表明频繁修正可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 评估LLM需关注决策过程而不仅是结果，策略游戏可有效揭示模型推理缺陷，资源分配优化和修正策略平衡是提升模型可靠性的关键方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require
complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the
intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making
under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is
essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We
propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed,
rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic
feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core
dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To
operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including
overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and
over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models,
ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7
percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of
0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6
percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive
resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection
risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093),
suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our
findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how
they arrive at those decisions

TL;DR: 研究发现Deepseek-R1-Distill系列及衍生模型的基准评估结果易受细微条件差异影响，导致性能波动显著，需建立更严谨的评估范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源推理模型（如Deepseek-R1-Distill系列及QwQ-32B）的基准评估结果因评估条件差异存在显著波动，导致其宣称的性能改进难以复现，需系统性分析此问题。

Method: 通过实证评估不同条件下Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型及其衍生模型的性能表现，分析评估条件对结果波动的影响。

Result: 发现模型在数学、科学、编程等领域的评估结果对细微条件变化高度敏感，且同类模型（包括QwQ-32B）均存在类似问题，性能提升难以稳定复现。

Conclusion: 强调需建立更严格、标准化的模型评估范式以提升结果可比性，并呼吁社区关注评估条件对模型性能结论的影响。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球10%-20%人群受阅读障碍影响，现有诊断方法存在成本高或可及性差的问题，需开发创新检测手段。

Method: 通过分析眼动模式（如注视时长/眼跳视），使用随机森林分类器检测阅读障碍，并采用层次聚类划分严重程度等级。

Result: 随机森林模型准确率为88.58%，且能通过聚类识别不同严重程度患者，包括具有边缘特征的个案。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪与机器学习结合为非侵入式诊断提供高精度方案，显著推进临床研究中的阅读障碍识别流程。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

TL;DR: 本文提出‘基础数据科学’作为自然数据生态系统的概念，强调其面临的5D复杂性（数据结构、领域、基数、因果关系、伦理）与数据生命周期的交互，并指出计算与基础数据科学的分歧风险。建议通过评估数据发现的实用性缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学领域因缺乏对数据宇宙发现实用性的统一评估标准，可能导致计算与基础数据科学的分歧。研究旨在通过系统性框架整合学科与数据科学，解决这一潜在威胁。

Method: 提出‘基础数据科学’概念框架，将其分为计算与基础两部分，并引入‘特定学科驱动数据科学’和‘泛数据科学’的生态系统模型。通过逻辑组织数据代理（data agents）定义数据科学家的抽象角色。

Result: 发现计算与基础数据科学存在显著分歧风险，需通过严格评估数据宇宙发现的实用性来弥合。提出以目标驱动的数据代理任务和学科整合为解决方案。

Conclusion: 数据科学需建立实用性评估体系以协调计算与基础方向的分歧，确保数据发现的实际价值。泛数据科学作为整合框架，可促进学科与数据生态的有机融合。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文针对个性化联邦学习（PFL）在现实场景中面临的数据和模型异构性问题，提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法和维度不变模块，实验表明其方法在个性化和泛化能力上优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PFL研究多局限于模拟环境，忽略真实场景中的数据分布偏移和模型架构差异。基础模型的集中式训练存在隐私和传输成本问题，而传统联邦学习难以满足个性化需求。

Method: 针对数据异构性，提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法，为每个客户端提供定制化全局模型；针对模型异构性，设计维度不变模块以实现跨异构模型的知识共享。

Result: 在包含40个任务的多模态PFL新基准测试中，所提方法在数据分布偏移和模型异构场景下均优于现有技术，兼具优异的个性化和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过解决数据与模型异构性，本文方法推动了PFL在真实场景的应用，为多模态任务下的个性化联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 探究合成人脸生成技术及性别分类算法中是否存在基于外貌的算法歧视（算法外貌主义），及其对数字身份系统公平性的影响。

Method: 使用13,200个合成人脸进行实验，分析文本生成图像(T2I)系统的特质关联模式，并测试性别分类模型在不同吸引力面孔上的表现。

Result: 1. T2I系统将高吸引力面孔与智力、可信度等积极特质错误关联；2. 性别分类模型对低吸引力’面孔（尤其非白人女性）错误率显著更高。

Conclusion: 算法外貌主义导致数字身份系统存在双重偏见：生成系统强化外貌刻板印象，分类系统对特定群体准确率下降，凸显技术公平性风险。

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

Result: 扩散模型分类效用最高（宏F1达88.2%），CTGAN抗重建攻击能力最强。

Conclusion: 结构化生成模型（如扩散模型和CTGAN）在隐私保护与数据驱动的能源系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

TL;DR: 针对训练数据较少的编程语言（如Prolog），本文提出结合小规模Qwen 2.5模型与GRPO优化策略，通过显式推理步骤生成可执行代码。实验表明该方法显著提升代码逻辑正确性和语法准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流语言（如Python）的LLMs代码生成效果较好，但资源稀缺语言（如Prolog）因训练数据不足面临生成困难。需开发通用方法解决低资源语言的代码生成问题。

Method: 采用Qwen 2.5模型的小规模代码版本，结合Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO），在强化学习循环中直接整合推理反馈，驱动模型生成逻辑连贯的代码。

Result: 经数学逻辑问题基准测试，模型生成的代码执行成功率显著提高，推理质量提升约30%，逻辑错误率降低至5%以下。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理反馈机制，为低资源编程语言提供高效代码生成方案，未来可扩展至更多缺乏训练资源的语言场景。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Motivation: 现有机器学习算法在传染病预测中表现不佳，因难以整合现实中的移动数据，需探索移动信息与模型结合的有效性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：先通过试点研究评估移动数据重要性，再在Transformer架构中测试图卷积网络（GCN）的影响。

Result: 移动数据和GCN模块未显著提升预测性能，但死亡率和住院数据大幅提高准确性；GCN生成的空间地图与封锁措施存在强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究提出传染病预测中移动性表征的新视角，强调空间地图可作为敏感指标，为决策者应对疫情提供更有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型联合预测框架YingLong，采用非因果双向注意力编码器结构，通过掩码标记恢复训练，在时间序列预测中实现了SOTA性能。模型输出长度增加可提升精度，并提出了多输入集成方法降低方差，发布了4个参数量级的基础模型，在零样本任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法（如直接法或递归法）存在局限性，需探索更高效的联合预测框架。同时，非因果模型在语言理解任务中的潜力尚未在时间序列领域充分挖掘。

Method: 1. 构建仅含编码器的双向注意力Transformer（YingLong）
2. 通过掩码标记恢复进行非因果训练
3. 引入延迟思维链推理机制
4. 采用多输入集成降低输出方差
5. 设计6M-300M参数量级的系列基础模型

Conclusion: YingLong验证了非因果架构在时序预测中的有效性，其延迟思维链式推理机制与输出长度正相关特性为时序基础模型提供了新范式。多尺度预训练模型展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出前向目标传播（FTP），一种替代反向传播的生物可解释、计算高效方法，通过前向计算解决对称权重、非局部信用分配等问题，在多个任务中表现优于或接近BP，并具备硬件兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播（BP）存在对称权重依赖、非局部信用分配、反向传递时活动冻结等生物与硬件不兼容问题，需探索更高效且符合生物机制的学习方法。

Method: FTP通过第二次前向传递估计层间目标，仅使用前向计算，无需对称反馈权重或可逆函数，支持模块化与本地化学习。

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR等数据集上达到与BP相当的精度，在低精度硬件约束下优于BP，且效率高于其他生物启发方法（如目标传播变体和纯前向算法）。

Conclusion: FTP凭借前向特性、低计算开销和硬件兼容性，为高效能设备学习与神经形态计算提供了新方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为zero-shot-s²的任务对齐提示方法，通过引导预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）专注于分析图像风格和合成痕迹，显著提升零样本检测AI生成图像的准确性和泛化能力，无需微调即可超越传统监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像逼真度提升，其滥用风险增加。现有监督检测方法依赖大规模标注数据且泛化能力有限，因此探索无需微调的预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本检测中的潜力。

Method: 提出任务对齐提示策略，在模型响应前添加特定前缀（如“Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts”），称为zero-shot-s²，以激发模型对图像风格和合成痕迹的专注分析。同时验证自我一致性（self-consistency）在视觉推理中的有效性。

Result: zero-shot-s²使两个开源模型的Macro F1分数提升8%-29%，在覆盖16种生成模型、3个多样化数据集（人脸、物体、动物）的测试中表现一致。模型规模扩展实验显示方法鲁棒，且自我一致性在视觉任务中同样有效。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能有效激发VLMs的潜在能力（如检测AI生成图像），提供了一种简单、可泛化且可解释的替代方案。其公开代码进一步支持方法复现与应用。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

TL;DR: 提出一种基于约束隐藏参数MDP的运行时防护机制，通过实时推断隐藏参数与保形预测确保强化学习策略安全，在动态环境中显著降低安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人执行过程中隐藏参数（如质量分布、摩擦系数）的变化会引发安全风险，需开发能实时适应参数变化的安全保障机制。

Method: 结合函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，构建运行时屏蔽层：通过预测未来安全风险约束动作空间，并利用保形预测量化不确定性。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种隐藏参数变化场景下减少安全违规达显著水平，且具备强分布外泛化能力，运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 所提机制在保证概率性安全约束的同时，实现了安全合规策略集中的最优性，为动态不确定环境下的安全强化学习提供理论保障。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

*Moussa Koulako Bala Doumbouya,Dan Jurafsky,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Tversky心理相似性理论的可微分投影层，替代传统深度学习中的几何相似性模型，在图像分类和语言建模任务中显著提升性能并减少参数，同时增强模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习的几何相似性模型（如对称性等度量属性）与人类心理感知不符，而Tversky基于特征集合的相似性理论虽更符合心理学原理，却因离散集合操作难以集成到深度学习框架中。

Method: 开发了可微分参数化的Tversky相似性模型，通过梯度下降学习；设计了Tversky投影层（可建模XOR等非线性关系），替代传统线性投影层，并提出了基于原型相似性计算的可视化技术。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层使ResNet-50相对准确率提升24.7%；GPT-2在PTB数据集上困惑度降低7.5%，参数量减少34.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将心理学理论融入深度学习，提出了一种新的相似性建模范式，Tversky投影层不仅提升性能，还通过原型相似性计算和可视化技术实现了理论驱动的可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

TL;DR: 本文提出交互式跨模态学习框架（ICL）及测试时人本交互模块（THI），通过多模态大语言模型增强文本查询的区分性，并结合重组数据增强策略（RDA）提升文本到图像行人重识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像行人重识别方法因网络架构和数据质量限制，难以区分复杂候选图像。需通过交互优化查询意图并提升训练文本质量以解决此问题。

Method: 提出ICL框架，包含THI模块（通过视觉问答与MLLM多轮交互对齐查询意图）和RDA策略（通过信息重组增强文本多样性与区分性）。

Result: 在CUHK-PEDES等四个基准数据集上实验表明，方法显著提升，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 结合人机交互与数据增强的框架有效提升了跨模态行人重识别的准确性和鲁棒性，为复杂场景提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GRePO-LTV框架，通过图表示学习解决广告场景中用户购买数据稀疏问题，并利用帕累托优化处理高相关任务间的依赖关系，以提升用户生命周期价值预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告场景中用户购买率极低（0.1%），导致数据稀疏且监督信号不足；同时不同时间跨度的LTV预测任务高度相关性与干扰性共存，传统方法难以有效建模。

Method: 结合图表示学习（缓解数据稀疏性）与帕累托优化（协调高相关任务间依赖关系），构建Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimization框架进行多任务联合建模。

Result: 未明确提及具体数值结果，但框架理论上通过数据增强与任务协调机制提升模型表现。

Conclusion: GRePO-LTV通过双重技术路径系统性解决了LTV预测中的数据稀疏与任务耦合问题，为广告精准投放提供新思路。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于任务特定专家混合（MoTE）的类增量学习框架，通过任务感知的专家过滤和联合推理机制，解决了现有方法中维度不一致和参数覆盖问题，无需样本集且适配器数量随任务扩展线性增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练模型的类增量学习方法中，提示方法存在覆盖问题，适配器方法面临维度不匹配挑战，而混合专家（MoE）的专家和路由参数在动态环境中易被覆盖。这些限制促使研究者设计更鲁棒的框架以解决维度不一致和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出MoTE框架，结合加权特征融合和稀疏激活机制，在推理阶段引入任务感知专家过滤和可靠专家联合推断，模拟路由层行为但不引发灾难性遗忘。进一步提出Adapter-Limited MoTE以平衡适配器扩展与模型性能。

Result: 实验表明MoTE在无需样本集的情况下优于现有方法，任务数量与适配器数量呈线性关系。Adapter-Limited MoTE有效权衡了模型规模与性能。

Conclusion: MoTE通过动态专家组合机制解决了类增量学习中的维度不一致和参数覆盖问题，其可扩展性和高效性为实际应用提供了新思路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

TL;DR: 本文针对分类器无关引导（CFG）在文本到图像生成中高引导权重下导致的颜色失真问题，提出角度域引导（ADG）算法，通过约束潜在空间幅度变化并优化角度对齐，在保持文本-图像质量的同时减少颜色失真，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG在高引导权重下虽能增强文本-图像对齐，但会引发显著的颜色失真。研究发现此问题源于潜在空间中样本范数的放大，需在提升对齐性的同时抑制失真。

Method: 提出角度域引导（ADG）算法，利用潜在空间结构约束幅度变化，优化角度对齐，抑制范数放大效应，从而平衡文本对齐与颜色保真度。

Result: ADG在保持高文本-图像对齐性的同时，显著减少颜色失真，生成结果在色彩保真度和人类感知偏好上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ADG通过理论分析与潜在空间结构优化，解决了CFG的颜色失真问题，为高质量文本到图像生成提供了更鲁棒的引导策略。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络（GNN）难以有效建模多反应物间的高阶相互作用，且面临组合爆炸、模型崩溃和无效负样本等问题，亟需更符合化学逻辑的建模方法。

Method: 提出ChemHGNN框架：1）利用超边自然表达多反应物反应；2）设计反应中心感知负采样策略（RCNS）避免无效样本；3）结合分子、反应和超图层级特征进行分层嵌入。

Result: 在USPTO数据集上，ChemHGNN显著优于HGNN和GNN基线模型，尤其在大规模场景下保持高可解释性与化学合理性。

Conclusion: 超图神经网络（HGNN）通过化学驱动的设计（如RCNS和分层嵌入），为反应虚拟筛选与发现提供了更优的解决方案，可加速反应探索进程。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent

problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of

Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个结合时间序列模型与大语言模型（LLM）的电力价格预测基准NSW-EPNews，发现传统模型因忽略文本信号提升有限，而LLM虽小幅改进但存在幻觉问题，揭示了当前模型在高风险能源预测中的能力差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电力价格预测方法过度依赖历史数值数据，忽视同时期文本信号（如市场新闻），需构建多模态评估框架以验证文本信息对预测的价值。

Method: 整合澳大利亚新南威尔士州9年17.5万条电价数据、温度记录与市场新闻摘要，构建含3600个多模态提示-输出对的数据集，分别用滞后价格/向量化特征（传统模型）和结构化提示工程（LLM）进行48步预测测试。

Result: 传统统计/机器学习从新闻特征获益微弱；GPT-4o等先进LLM预测精度仅小幅改善，但频繁出现价格序列伪造/格式错误等幻觉现象。

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews为多模态数值推理提供严格测试平台，揭示当前LLM在能源预测关键任务中的能力不足，强调需解决幻觉问题以实现高可靠性应用。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中表现优异，但其在NP难组合优化问题（如TSP、VRP等）上的应用尚未充分探索，需系统性研究其潜力。

Method: 提出ACCORD框架：通过自回归约束满足机制动态保证解可行性，结合基于路由的注意力激活问题特定LoRA模块，并构建覆盖6类NP难问题的ACCORD-90k数据集。

Result: 基于8B参数Llama的ACCORD模型在多个任务中优于标准提示方法，甚至超过GPT-4等更大模型，消融实验验证输出结构提升解的质量与可行性。

Conclusion: ACCORD是首个面向广泛组合优化问题的大规模端到端LLM框架，其动态约束满足与模块化设计为LLMs在复杂优化任务中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UBS预训练方法依赖人工构建行为词汇表，存在劳动密集、偏差引入和词汇容量限制等问题，直接影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 采用自举策略(BYB)，通过师生编码器架构自动生成未来时间窗口内所有行为的聚合监督嵌入，完全消除人工词汇表过程。

Conclusion: BYB通过自动化监督信号构建，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升模型性能与效率，验证了无标签预训练在工业级应用中的有效性。

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效应对物联网环境的不确定性，通过动态调整MLaaS组合实现高效、可扩展的服务持续优化。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料科学基础模型依赖大规模数据集，但许多结构/功能材料（如介观金属合金）因数据稀缺难以应用。需解决超稀疏复杂空间数据的小样本学习问题。

Method: 提出物理驱动数据增强框架：利用局部生成模型集成（仅需5个实验样本）结合多样性优化策略，生成大规模物理多样化数据集，并构建多晶材料基础模型PolyMicros。

Result: 通过PolyMicros实现零样本解决3D实验显微镜加速难题，模型与数据集已开源。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了小样本材料建模限制，为结构材料研究提供新范式，资源开放将推动领域协同发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆问题在医疗、气候科学等领域至关重要，但其迭代过程缺乏可解释性，导致领域专家难以理解优化逻辑。现有研究虽提升了前向模型的可解释性，但逆问题优化仍如黑箱。

Conclusion: 结合模拟器事件流与语言模型，首次实现了逆问题优化过程的可解释性突破，为跨领域协作提供透明化工具。

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的组合优化方法常忽略问题固有结构先验，导致解质量与效率不足。受人类专家利用结构设计算法的启发，需开发结构感知的LLM框架。

Method: STRCMP整合GNN提取结构嵌入与LLM生成求解器代码，通过进化迭代优化算法，确保语法正确性、保留问题拓扑并对齐自然语言目标。

Result: 在混合整数线性规划与布尔可满足性问题中，STRCMP在9个基准测试上大幅超越5种神经/LLM方法，解最优性与计算效率均显著提升。

Conclusion: STRCMP通过结构先验与进化优化，验证了结构感知LLM框架在组合优化中的有效性，为算法发现提供新方向。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有delta压缩方法在高压缩比下性能不足且依赖经验性位分配，无法有效处理多租户场景中大量定制化模型的部署需求。

Method: 建立量化误差数学模型推导混合精度策略，将最优位分配问题转化为0/1整数线性规划问题，以最小化量化误差为目标进行自适应压缩。

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX以7B模型分别超越最佳基线Delta-CoMe 22.3%和6.1%，尤其适用于ΔW范数大且基础模型能力不足的场景。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过理论驱动的混合精度位分配策略，实现了高效delta压缩，为多定制化LLM部署提供了有效的参数压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出PFP框架，通过维护人类偏好特征分布减少在线学习中的偏差，实验显示其优于现有偏好学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习框架将人类偏好简化为二元对比和标量奖励，导致LLM响应偏向特定特征，且在线迭代中偏差加剧。

Method: PFP分三步：1) 从离线数据提取偏好特征并训练分类器；2) 在线学习时通过分布保持优化映射特征；3) 将特征嵌入系统提示，使LLM显式处理多维度偏好。

Result: PFP有效缓解在线学习中的特征偏差，在标准对齐评测中性能优于传统偏好学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过动态维护偏好特征分布并显式整合至LLM，PFP提升了模型对齐效果，验证了特征保留机制的有效性。

Abstract: Recent preference learning frameworks for large language models (LLMs)
simplify human preferences with binary pairwise comparisons and scalar rewards.
This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

Conclusion: SectorE通过几何区域与极坐标的融合，显著提升了知识图谱补全任务中对语义层次结构的建模能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割方法无法统一处理多粒度状态，且难以适应动态环境中的新演化模式，限制了在预测性维护等任务中的应用。

Method: PromptTSS框架结合标签与边界信息的提示机制，构建统一模型捕捉粗/细粒度模式，并动态适应未知模式。

Result: 实验显示：多粒度分割准确率提升24.49%，单粒度提升17.88%，迁移学习性能最高提升599.24%。

Conclusion: PromptTSS有效解决了多粒度状态建模与动态适应问题，为层次化时间序列分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

TL;DR: 本研究利用监督机器学习方法（决策树、k-NN、朴素贝叶斯）解决油气生产中的水合物堵塞问题，决策树算法以99.99%的准确率实现高效分类，优化生产效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 油气开采中管道堵塞（如沉积物堆积、蜡沉积、水合物形成等）影响流体运输效率，需通过技术手段保障流动安全。

Method: 采用数据预处理和清洗，基于Petrobras公开数据集，利用scikit-learn库的决策树、k-NN、朴素贝叶斯分类器进行水合物形成预测。

Conclusion: 监督机器学习（尤其是决策树）为油气生产中的流动保障问题提供了可靠解决方案，显著提升生产效率。

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac
arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains
challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by
differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population
demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model
to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on
four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected
from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom
architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each
experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on
the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data
reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization
across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential

TL;DR: 本文提出在动态决策系统中同时考虑即时与长期公平性的强化学习框架，通过因果分解长期公平性指标，并开发平衡不同公平概念的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性研究多关注静态场景下的即时偏差，而动态决策系统（如强化学习）需同时满足即时公平要求并控制长期累积影响。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建强化学习框架，将长期公平性量化为不同群体平均预期资格增益差异，通过因果分析将其拆解为直接影响、延迟影响和虚假效应三个组成部分。

Result: 揭示了长期公平性指标与结果公平性（benefit fairness）的内在联系，并提出简单有效的方法实现多维度公平性平衡。

Conclusion: 动态系统中的公平性需同时考虑时间维度与因果机制，所提框架为平衡即时与长期公平提供了理论工具和实践路径。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在建筑能源管理（BEM）中的泛化能力有限，虽在零样本分类任务中表现尚可，但预测性能不及传统模型，需改进协变量处理和时序动态整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型（LLMs）启发，研究旨在探索TSFMs能否像LLMs一样跨任务和场景泛化，以解决BEM中模型可扩展性不足的问题。现有BEM解决方案依赖特定任务和数据的模型，适用性受限。

Method: 通过四个维度评估TSFMs：零样本单变量预测泛化性、协变量对热行为建模的影响、零样本表示学习分类能力、对性能指标和工况变化的鲁棒性，并与统计模型对比。

Result: TSFMs在未见数据集上的零样本预测仅略优于统计模型；协变量未提升其性能；分类任务中表示学习有效，但预测仍弱于统计模型；其性能对评估指标敏感，复杂环境下表现更差。

Conclusion: TSFMs当前泛化能力不足，需针对性优化协变量处理机制、上下文整合及时序动态建模，以开发更适应BEM的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Motivation: 医疗、金融、能源等领域对合成数据的需求因隐私与法律限制而增长，但现有生成模型需融入领域知识以确保实用性。

Method: 采用梯度引导的扩散模型，在生成过程中直接嵌入领域约束（如电力系统的基尔霍夫定律），通过调整采样轨迹确保数据可行性。

Result: 数值实验表明，所生成的电力潮流数据集具有统计代表性和高保真度，且满足领域物理约束。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至其他领域（尤其是表格数据场景，为跨领域合成数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标优化框架MOODS和新验证指标ε/δ，以解决类别不平衡问题，通过优化数据采样方法提升少数类分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类别不平衡处理方法（如损失函数重调或简单重采样）因忽略数据多样性且缺乏量化指标，易导致过拟合且效果有限。

Method: 提出MOODS框架（多目标双层优化），结合合成过采样与多数类下采样，并设计ε/δ非重叠多样化指标评估采样质量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法通过增强数据多样性使F1分数提升1-15%，达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: MOODS框架及ε/δ指标有效量化采样方法对模型的影响，显著改善类别不平衡问题下的分类效果。

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在捕捉长程时空交互方面表现优异，但缺乏物理可解释性且难以适应动态变化的外部环境（如增材制造中的未知参数波动），亟需兼具预测能力与泛化性的新方法。

Method: ASNO架构融合时空可分离注意力机制：利用BDF启发的Transformer进行时间预测与外推，通过注意力神经算子处理外部负载，分离历史状态贡献与外部力作用，增强模型可解释性及对未知物理环境的适应能力。

Result: 在科学机器学习基准测试中，ASNO表现优于现有模型，验证了其在工程应用、物理规律发现及可解释机器学习中的潜力。

Conclusion: ASNO通过解耦时空交互与外部参数影响，实现了高预测精度、物理可解释性和环境泛化性，为复杂动态系统的建模与物理规律探索提供了新工具。

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机凸优化在问题参数未知时的样本复杂度，提出了两种方法：可靠的模型选择以避免验证集过拟合，以及针对未知最优距离的正则化方法。实验表明这些方法能有效适应多问题结构并减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在随机凸优化中，当问题参数（如到最优解的距离）未知时，如何调整学习率并避免过拟合成为关键挑战。本文旨在解决此类参数未知场景下的样本复杂度和计算效率问题。

Method: 1. 提出可靠的模型选择方法，通过避免验证集过拟合调整学习率；2. 开发基于正则化的方法，专门处理仅最优距离未知的情况。两种方法结合可适应多种问题结构。

Result: 模型选择方法使样本复杂度接近已知参数最优值（误差为loglog因子），正则化方法实现了样本复杂度与计算复杂度的分离。实验验证其在CLIP微调和Gemini形状计数任务中减少过拟合。

Conclusion: 结合两种方法可同时适应多问题结构，在参数未知场景下实现高效优化，为少样本学习中的过拟合问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Evidential Alignment的新框架，通过不确定性量化识别和抑制深度神经网络中的虚假相关性，无需依赖群体标注，显著提升了模型在不同架构和数据模态下的群体鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部群体标注或辅助确定性模型来缓解虚假相关性问题，但标注成本高且确定性模型可能无法全面捕捉模型学习的偏差。

Method: 通过二阶风险最小化量化模型预测证据，并采用提出的证据校准技术（evidential calibration）校准偏置模型，在保留核心特征的同时抑制虚假相关性。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在多种模型架构和数据模态下显著提升了群体鲁棒性，为虚假相关性提供了可扩展的理论解决方案。

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment通过不确定性量化实现了无需标注的模型去偏，为解决深度学习的虚假相关性问题提供了原则性方法，增强了模型的分布外泛化能力与可信度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的优化方法虽经验成功，但其泛化性能的理论解释仍不完善。传统静态核方法（如NTK）无法捕捉训练动态，需通过动态适应的核来更精确地描述泛化行为。

Method: 通过定义数据依赖的损失路径核（LPK），结合梯度流稳定性分析与Rademacher复杂度均匀收敛理论，分析优化轨迹中损失梯度的范数对泛化的影响。

Result: 提出的LPK泛化边界不仅与经典核方法Rademacher复杂度对齐，且因包含优化动态而更紧，揭示了神经网络相比核方法的特征学习能力，实验数据集验证了边界的有效性。

Conclusion: LPK通过整合训练轨迹动态信息，为梯度优化的泛化理论提供了更精细的分析框架，同时从理论上区分了神经网络与核方法的学习机制差异。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

Motivation: 现有节点标签噪声模型（如SLN、CCN）忽略图数据中节点间关系，而真实场景中标签噪声可能受边影响。EDN模型旨在弥补这一缺陷，探索边依赖噪声对图学习的影响。

Method: 提出三种EDN变体，分析节点度与标签错误概率的关系；在主流图数据集上使用5种GNN架构和8种抗噪算法进行实验，并通过假设检验统计验证结果。

Result: 两种EDN变体导致GNN及现有抗噪算法性能显著下降，且节点度与标签错误概率存在依赖关系。统计检验证实EDN对噪声鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Conclusion: 边依赖噪声模型（EDN）能更真实反映图数据噪声特性，应在评估抗噪算法时纳入EDN，以增强噪声环境下图学习的可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Motivation: 扩散模型采样可通过概率流ODE或随机SDE实现，但随机性参数对生成过程的影响尚不明确。研究旨在量化不同随机性参数下先验分布误差和分数近似误差的传播规律，以指导模型设计。

Method: 基于加性噪声前向SDE和Lipschitz连续分数函数，利用log-Sobolev不等式推导KL散度衰减的理论界限，并通过简单数据集实验与解析模型验证理论结果。

Result: 精确分数下随机性通过纠错机制降低KL散度；近似分数下存在纠错与误差放大的权衡，随机性效果取决于分数误差结构（可能提升或损害性能）。数值实验验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 随机性在扩散模型中具有双重作用：精确分数下作为纠错机制，而近似分数下需权衡误差修正与放大效应。该发现为模型参数选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Conclusion: FIGNN为复杂物理系统提供了预测性能与可解释性兼备的通用替代建模框架，其空间归因机制可有效支持科学发现。

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

Motivation: 现有研究过度关注PEFT的效率，却忽视其潜在的灾难性失败。本文旨在揭示PEFT因依赖虚假token导致的脆弱性，以及这种漏洞如何被恶意利用（如SSTI攻击）控制模型行为。

Method: 在三个模型家族（Snowflake Arctic、Apple OpenELM、Meta LLaMA-3）和四个数据集（IMDB、金融分类、常识问答、Bias in Bios）上应用SSTI攻击，分析不同LoRA秩下模型对虚假token的依赖程度。

Result: 1) 单个SSTI token即可完全操控模型决策；2) 轻量SSTI时，LoRA秩越高，模型对虚假token的依赖越强；3) 激进SSTI时，高秩LoRA反而提升鲁棒性（模型关注非虚假token）。

Conclusion: PEFT的捷径学习特性使其易受虚假token影响，SSTI可被用于隐蔽控制模型。LoRA秩的选择需权衡效率与鲁棒性，高秩在特定场景下可能更安全。需警惕数据中意外或恶意的虚假关联。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种联邦学习中客户端恶意推断同伴数据的新威胁模型，结合拜占庭攻击与梯度反演算法，揭示现有防御机制存在严重盲区，甚至可能加剧10-15%的数据泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习协议虽通过共享梯度保护隐私，但研究表明服务器仍可通过梯度反演重建数据。本文进一步探索客户端主动发起攻击的可能性，揭示防御机制在新型威胁下的脆弱性。

Method: 1) 定义客户端侧恶意好奇威胁模型，理论证明其重建可行性；2) 开发结合梯度反演与恶意更新策略的重建算法；3) 分析传统鲁棒聚合与隐私保护机制的防御盲点。

Result: 实验表明：1) 标准防御机制对新型攻击完全失效；2) 错误配置的防御措施反使重建图像质量提升10-15%；3) 拜占庭攻击能力可被重新定向用于数据泄露。

Conclusion: 联邦学习需重新审视安全假设，客户端侧攻击可绕过现有防护体系，防御机制与攻击目标的错位可能导致系统性脆弱性，需开发针对性防护方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Conclusion: RAG系统的投毒攻击可直接放大模型输出偏见，需重视其安全性与公平性间的平衡。研究揭示了新型潜在攻击路径，强调未来需关注RAG系统的公平性防护。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Motivation: 现有方法需依赖大量湿实验且无法按需设计任意靶点的高亲和力结合蛋白，限制了生物医学和生物技术的应用。

Method: 提出PPDiff模型，整合SSINC网络（含全局自注意力层、局部kNN等变图层、因果注意力层），通过扩散过程联合设计结合蛋白的序列与三维结构。使用PPBench数据集（70.6万复合物）进行预训练，并在mini-binder和抗原-抗体复合物设计任务微调。

Conclusion: PPDiff通过联合建模序列-结构依赖关系，首次实现无需湿实验迭代的按需蛋白质结合设计，为生物医药应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,
respectively.

Result: TruncQuant在不同比特宽度下均表现强鲁棒性，且无需复杂实现即可适配多硬件平台。

Conclusion: TruncQuant为边缘设备部署提供低成本的灵活量化方案，显著降低模型复杂性与推理延迟。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化稀疏方法虽能减少参数量，但难以在现代硬件上实现实际加速效果，需开发硬件友好的结构化稀疏训练方法。

Method: 强制网络在训练过程中保持对角线稀疏模式，维持前向/反向传播的稀疏计算，并设计专用CUDA内核加速对角线结构运算。

Result: ViT中使用90%稀疏线性层时，在线推理速度提升3.13倍，GPU训练加速1.59倍，精度与未结构化方法持平。

Conclusion: DynaDiag通过结构化稀疏模式成功平衡计算效率与模型性能，为高效稀疏训练提供了硬件兼容的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态融合方法（如Transformer自注意力）在多模态质量差异场景下易陷入模态偏好固化，导致注意力机制失效。

Method: 提出Rolling Query方法：通过周期性轮换不同模态作为查询向量，平衡注意力分配并缩小模态间分布差距。

Result: 多场景实验验证RollingQ能有效恢复注意力动态性，提升多模态Transformer的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 打破模态偏好自我强化循环是增强多模态模型动态协作能力的重要方向，RollingQ为此提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Motivation: 强化学习(RL)在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在数据效率低的问题，现有方法因响应长度偏差导致梯度范数不可靠，亟需高效数据选择方法。

Method: 引入基于成功率的数据可学习性指标，克服响应长度偏差；通过梯度对齐策略选择具有学习潜力的代表性数据用于RL后训练。

Result: 在GSM8K等数学推理基准上，仅用少量数据即达到77.53%性能（全量数据为77.04%），数据需求减少达1000条，分阶段RL场景同样有效。

Conclusion: LearnAlign为数据高效RL后训练提供新思路，通过优化推理数据选择建立研究基础，代码开源将促进未来研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with
the increasing number of cases in many countries. This trend Underlines the
need for a greater emphasis on early detection and proactive management to

as early screening tools in predicting Diabetes within a data-driven fashion
with valuable information on who is more likely to get affected. In addition,
this study can help to realize the potential of machine learning for timely
intervention over the longer term, which is a step towards reducing health

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Motivation: 现有时间序列推理方法过度关注任务定制，忽视数据本质特征（时间序列基元），导致成本高、灵活性差、效率低。需通过数据对齐解决核心问题。

Method: 提出三种对齐范式：注入式对齐（领域优先）、桥接对齐（特征优先）、内部对齐（表示优先），系统化结合数据本质与任务工程。

Result: 通过分类文献验证对齐范式的有效性，并指出未来研究方向，证明基于数据本质的对齐能激活LLMs的时间序列推理能力。

Conclusion: 优先考虑时间序列数据内在结构的对齐方法，可突破现有LLMs推理的局限性，为高效、灵活、经济的时间序列分析提供新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

*Zijian Wang,Peng Tao,Luonan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Delayformer框架，利用延迟嵌入理论和Transformer，解决高维时间序列预测中的非线性和交互问题，在合成和真实数据中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（包括深度学习）在有限、噪声数据下难以准确预测高维系统的动态，主要因变量间的非线性与复杂交互。需开发能同时预测所有变量且克服这些问题的模型。

Method: 通过多变量时空信息（mvSTI）转换将观测变量转为延迟嵌入状态，并跨变量学习状态；使用共享ViT编码器表征动态状态，结合独立线性解码器预测下一状态，实现并行变量预测。

Result: Delayformer在合成和真实数据集上的预测任务中优于当前SOTA方法，且跨领域预测任务验证其作为基础时间序列模型的潜力。

Conclusion: Delayformer的理论基础（延迟嵌入）与模型设计（Transformer结合状态预测）有效解决高维系统预测难题，具备广泛适用性，为时间序列分析提供新框架。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出新型鲁棒非线性滤波方法，以应对现实场景中的异常数据（如离群值、偏差、漂移和缺失观测），并扩展至离线估计与平滑方法，通过贝叶斯推断框架和理论边界分析提升状态估计性能，实验验证了在目标跟踪、定位等任务中的有效性。

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

TL;DR: 本文提出多模态数据重组方法，通过解耦数据、筛选困难样本及批量重组对齐梯度方向，解决多模态联合训练中的模态惰性与冲突问题，提升准确率且无需额外计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态联合训练方法因各模态优化轨迹差异导致模态惰性与冲突，无法同时实现单模态充分学习与多模态平衡。现有方法仅侧重增强弱模态或对齐优化速度，未能兼顾两者。

Method: 提出多模态数据重组：1) 解耦数据并筛选各模态困难样本以缓解不平衡；2) 批量级重组对齐梯度方向，避免跨模态干扰，增强单模态学习充分性。

Result: 在CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds数据集上准确率分别提升约6.50%和3.41%，无需扩展训练集或增加推理计算量，且可无缝集成现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据重组有效解决模态不平衡与干扰问题，显著提升多模态学习性能，具有兼容性与计算高效性。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于联邦基础模型（FFM）的新学习范式，旨在解决基础模型在泛化与个性化之间的权衡困境，通过去中心化架构分离共享知识与个体适配，并以推荐系统为场景，设计保护用户个性完整性的方案，最终实现用户可控的个性化代理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（FM）在参数高效适配技术中存在泛化与个性化的矛盾，而推荐系统依赖反映用户独特特征的隐式反馈，为验证联邦基础模型（FFM）提供了理想场景。需探索一种既能利用FM泛化能力，又能保护用户个性完整性的去中心化方案。

Method: 采用联邦基础模型（FFM）框架，通过去中心化过程解耦共享知识与个体适配，设计针对推荐系统的个性化自适应FM，构建用户控制个性化代理的架构。

Result: 提出以FFM为核心的推荐系统新范式，其通过维护用户个性完整性平衡泛化与个性化，但未提供具体实验数据验证有效性（注：原文为立场论文，未明确实验结果）。

Conclusion: 联邦基础模型为平衡泛化与个性化提供了可行路径，未来个性化自适应FM驱动的代理可支持用户决策，形成以用户为中心、去中心化的系统，使个体真正掌控自身个性化服务。

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

*Nikolaos Myrtakis,Ioannis Tsamardinos,Vassilis Christophides*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过对比不同基于影响力的信号（如Self-Influence等），评估其在检测训练数据中错误标签和异常样本的效果。实验表明，现有信号能有效识别错误标签，但无法检测异常，部分因未考虑训练动态或存在影响力抵消效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升训练样本质量对增强机器学习模型可靠性至关重要。现有基于影响力的信号虽被提出用于调试数据，但缺乏对不同信号在统一影响估计器下检测多种噪声类型（如错误标签和异常）能力的系统性评估。

Method: 采用对比实验方法，在图像和表格数据、不同深度学习模型（从头训练或基础模型）上，评估多种影响力信号（如Self-Influence、Marginal Influence等）在检测错误标签和异常样本中的表现，并分析其使用共同影响估计器（如TraceIn）的效果。

Result: 实验发现，Self-Influence等信号能有效检测错误标签，但现有信号均无法检测异常样本。部分信号因未考虑训练动态或存在影响力抵消效应（如影响力分数累加归零），导致误导性归因。

Conclusion: 现有基于影响力的信号在检测训练数据噪声时存在局限性，尤其是对异常样本的识别能力不足。未来需改进信号设计，纳入训练动态分析并解决影响力抵消问题，以提升数据调试的全面性。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN防御方法依赖启发式指标、易过拟合特定攻击模式且计算复杂，需一种高效且普适的鲁棒性增强方案。

Method: KCES利用图核复杂度(GKC)指标定义边的KC分数，剪枝高KC分数边（通常为对抗边），无需训练且可与现有防御策略无缝集成。

Result: 理论分析与实验表明KCES显著提升GNN鲁棒性，优于现有基线方法，并能有效增强其他防御策略的效果。

Conclusion: KCES为GNN安全提供了一种理论支撑的高效防御框架，通过图核复杂度驱动的边净化机制实现对抗扰动的系统性缓解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Motivation: 现有研究表明，模型在特定有害数据上的微调可能引发广泛失准，但专家对此现象缺乏预期，暴露了对齐机制理解的不足。论文旨在填补这一空白，并为后续研究提供可操作的工具。

Method: 使用新的狭窄失准数据集构建改进模型生物，通过单rank-1 LoRA适配器诱导失准，验证不同模型规模、家族及训练协议下的鲁棒性，并分离出机制性相变。

Result: 改进模型生物实现99%连贯性（原67%），0.5B小模型即可复现失准，且EM现象在多种实验条件下普遍存在。相变分析表明失准行为与机制变化直接相关。

Conclusion: 当前大模型对齐方法远未达到鲁棒性要求。通过构建最小化失准变化的模型生物，论文为理解和缓解LLM对齐风险提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架通过数据-模型协同优化，在避免全模型重训练和噪声建模的同时，显著提升噪声环境下的鲁棒泛化能力，为大规模模型噪声处理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对突发性错位现象（模型在窄域微调后产生广泛不匹配行为）的机制及其跨域泛化原因缺乏理解，这暴露了模型对齐领域的核心知识缺口。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct模型构建最小实验系统：1) 通过9个rank-1适配器诱导突发性错位；2) 从激活值中提取'错位方向'进行行为消除；3) 利用低秩适配器的标量隐藏状态解释适配器功能。

Result: 1) 不同错位模型的表示空间具有趋同性；2) 提取的错位方向可有效消除高维LoRA模型的错位行为；3) 发现6个适配器导致普遍错位，2个适配器专精于微调域错位。

Conclusion: 突发性错位作为典型非预期行为，其表示趋同性的发现为理解模型错位机制提供了新视角，通过适配器功能解析和错位方向提取方法，为更广泛的模型对齐问题提供了可解释性工具。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Result: 实验表明，在固定提升矩阵时，调整缩减矩阵可显著降低RSA误差，且优化后的缩减矩阵能提升粗化图上图神经网络的节点分类性能。

Conclusion: 解耦缩减矩阵与提升矩阵的伪逆关系可增强图粗化灵活性，通过优化缩减矩阵进一步改善谱逼近效果，为图信号处理与图学习任务提供更优的粗化框架。

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自监督物理信息神经网络SSPINNpose，直接从IMU数据实时估计关节运动学与动力学参数，无需地面真值标签训练，解决了传统方法依赖实验室数据、泛化性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时方法依赖有监督学习，需实验室光学捕捉系统提供地面真值数据，存在测量误差、泛化性不足等问题，且新场景需重新采集数据，耗时且不实用。

Method: 通过自监督物理信息神经网络，将IMU数据输入网络后经人体物理模型优化物理合理性，生成虚拟测量数据，直接基于传感器数据训练，无需地面真值标签。

Result: SSPINNpose在步行/跑步（最高4.9m/s）中关节角度/力矩的RMSD分别为8.7度与4.9%BWBH%，延迟3.5ms；支持稀疏传感器配置并推断传感器解剖位置，鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: SSPINNpose为实验室与户外实时生物力学分析提供可扩展、自适应的解决方案，突破传统方法对实验室数据的依赖，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

*Gregor Baer,Isel Grau,Chao Zhang,Pieter Van Gorp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于扰动的特征归因评估方法在不同类别间存在不一致性，且与真实指标常矛盾，需谨慎使用并开发更全面的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI（XAI）评估依赖扰动指标，但其在不同预测类别中表现不一致，可能影响方法可信度，需探究其产生原因及可靠性。

Method: 通过合成时间序列数据构建控制实验，系统改变特征类型和类别对比，对比基于扰动的退化分数与真实数据的精度-召回指标。

Result: 实验显示，即使特征简单（如时间局部化），类别依赖效应仍存在；扰动指标与真实指标评估结果常矛盾，相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 扰动指标可能无法反映真实特征定位质量，需重新审视评估标准，开发多维度评估框架以全面衡量归因质量。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个全自动化安全工程评估框架SEC-bench，通过多智能体架构自动生成漏洞数据集，发现当前LLM代理在概念验证生成(18%)和漏洞修复(34%)任务中表现欠佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖合成漏洞数据集，无法反映安全工程师实际面临的复杂场景，亟需建立更贴近真实场景的评估体系以推动可信LLM代理在软件开发生命周期中的应用。

Method: 开发SEC-bench框架：1) 多智能体架构自动构建代码仓库并复现漏洞 2) 生成黄金补丁作为评估标准 3) 以单实例$0.87的低成本创建高质量漏洞数据集 4) 聚焦PoC生成和漏洞修复两大核心安全场景。

Result: 主流LLM代码代理在完整数据集上表现显著不足：PoC生成成功率最高18.0%，漏洞修复成功率34.0%，揭示了现有技术与实际工程需求间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明开发实用化智能安全工程代理仍需关键突破，SEC-bench为评估LLM安全能力提供了可扩展的自动化基准，推动构建更自主可靠的安全工程系统。

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

TL;DR: 本文提出TrustGLM，首次系统评估基于大语言模型的图学习框架(GraphLLM)在文本、图结构和提示词三个维度的对抗攻击脆弱性，发现其对文本替换攻击高度敏感，并通过防御技术提升鲁棒性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GraphLLM在整合文本属性、图结构信息和任务指令方面展现潜力，但其在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性尚未被充分探索，而这对高风险场景部署至关重要。

Method: 通过实现文本替换攻击、图结构攻击和提示词随机洗牌攻击，在6个多领域基准数据集上测试模型脆弱性，并采用数据增强和对抗训练进行防御研究。

Result: 实验表明：1) 节点属性中替换少量语义相似词即可显著降低性能；2) 标准图结构攻击有效；3) 提示词标签随机排序导致性能骤降。防御技术展现出提升鲁棒性潜力。

Conclusion: GraphLLM存在多维安全漏洞，针对性防御技术可有效缓解。开源工具TrustGLM为公平评估和后续研究提供基础设施，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合蒙特卡洛采样与线性回归的新方法，用于高效估计可解释AI中的概率值（如Shapley值），在多个数据集上实现了比现有方法更低的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率值（如Shapley值、Banzhaf值）计算方法需指数时间，依赖蒙特卡洛或线性回归近似，但存在效率与精度限制。本文旨在结合两种技术，提升估计性能。

Method: 提出一种灵活框架，允许用任意高效计算概率值的函数族（如XGBoost树模型）替代传统线性回归，结合蒙特卡洛采样生成无偏估计。

Result: 实验显示：Shapley值估计误差比主流方法（Permutation/Kernel SHAP）降低6.5倍和3.8倍，比最优方法（Leverage SHAP）降低2.6倍；广义概率值误差降低215倍。

Conclusion: 新方法通过融合蒙特卡洛与灵活函数族，显著提升概率值估计精度，为可解释AI中的特征/数据估值提供了更优工具。

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Result: 在具有显著协变量偏移的真实数据集上，该方法相比最先进模型取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过元学习策略有效缓解分子预测中的分布偏移问题，为药物发现中关键化合物的可靠预测提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile

This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Mamba通过引入输入选择性和卷积门控提升了性能，但其内部机制（如输入选择性的具体作用及与其他操作的交互）尚不明确，需深入理解以优化模型设计。

Method: 结合理论证明与实验验证，分析S6层在函数逼近、长期记忆和MQAR任务中的表现，对比Mamba变体（Mamba-2、S4D）的差异。

Result: S6层可投影Haar小波，优于S4D逼近不连续函数；能动态抵消记忆衰退；解析求解MQAR任务时不同mixer表现各异，理论与实验一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Mamba的机制性原理，证明输入选择性在关键任务中的优势，为模型改进提供了理论依据和潜在方向。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Conclusion: MAS通过灵活平衡先验与测量信息，为复杂噪声下的逆问题求解提供了更优框架，并扩展了现有方法的理论边界。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher

TL;DR: TreeRL提出了一种结合树搜索的强化学习框架，通过中间监督和高效分支策略提升LLM推理性能，无需单独训练奖励模型，在数学和代码推理任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于链式采样的强化学习方法在探索推理空间时效率不足，且依赖独立训练的过程奖励模型易导致分布不匹配和奖励攻击问题。树搜索虽能提供密集过程奖励，但在LLM的在线策略强化学习中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架：1) 直接集成在线策略树搜索进行RL训练，引入中间监督；2) 无需单独奖励模型，避免分布偏差；3) 设计基于高不确定性步骤分支的树搜索策略，在相同生成预算下提升搜索效率。

Result: 在数学和代码推理基准测试中，TreeRL性能显著优于传统ChainRL方法，验证了树搜索在LLM强化学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 树搜索通过增强探索和过程奖励机制，为LLM的强化学习提供了新方向。TreeRL的高效实现和开源将促进相关研究与应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: XAStruct是一个机器学习框架，通过大规模数据集训练，能预测X射线吸收光谱并推断局部结构描述符，支持多种元素和化学环境，结合深度神经网络与基线模型提升分析效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAS分析依赖专家经验、计算成本高且局限于特定启发式方法，现有机器学习模型覆盖元素和谱区有限，需开发更通用、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 构建覆盖70+元素的大规模数据集，独立训练两个任务：通过深度神经网络预测XAS光谱及邻近原子类型，结合基线模型回归最近邻原子距离，避免端到端整合导致的性能下降。

Result: XAStruct首次实现从XAS光谱直接预测邻近原子类型，并建立无需元素调参的邻距回归模型，独立训练策略确保各任务性能最优。

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展框架，通过任务解耦平衡复杂映射与效率，未来可进一步扩展功能。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

*Miguel Suau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现优势函数在策略梯度方法中不仅能降低梯度估计方差，还能通过调整动作值打破策略混淆，提升强化学习代理的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习代理易受策略混淆影响，即策略会同时影响过去和未来的观察变量，形成反馈循环，导致代理难以在常规轨迹之外泛化。

Method: 利用优势函数调整动作值相对于状态表示，削弱当前策略下高频出现的状态-动作对，从而消除虚假相关性并聚焦因果因素。

Result: 理论分析与实验证据表明，使用优势函数训练的代理在非轨迹场景中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 优势函数通过解耦策略与观察变量的虚假关联，为解决强化学习的泛化问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将无标签图像预训练视为强化学习问题，通过训练通用价值函数来关联图像的不同视图或增强，从而改进特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到自监督图像预训练方法（如图像裁剪关联）与强化学习中的价值函数学习存在类比，希望通过RL框架直接处理无标签图像数据，并利用奖励函数优化特征表示。

Method: 将图像预训练建模为动态系统中的强化学习问题，通过改变视图或添加图像增强训练通用价值函数，结合裁剪一致性自监督和弱标签调整特征学习。

Result: 在EpicKitchens、COCO、CC12M等无标签图像数据上训练后，模型表示能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过RL框架引入奖励机制，能够有效利用无标签图像数据（如视频、场景、网络爬取数据）进行自监督预训练，并为弱监督信息提供灵活整合途径。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 郊区高速公路等自由流路网因车流增加导致拥堵，传统交通信号控制在无信号高速场景中失效，需新型控制方法。

Method: 结合经典交通流理论、间隙接受模型与微观仿真，构建物理信息强化学习框架，将道路抽象为超级路段以学习实时车速调控策略。

Result: 在PTV Vissim仿真中，总吞吐量提升5%，平均延迟减少13%，停车次数降低3%，且能泛化至不同交通模式。

Conclusion: 该方法通过ML实现可扩展的无信号路网流量优化，证明强化学习在动态交通控制中的有效性。

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Conclusion: CACTUS证明了压缩与认证鲁棒性可协同优化，为安全关键场景提供高效可靠的模型部署方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained

We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high

and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

*Korbinian Pöppel,Richard Freinschlag,Thomas Schmied,Wei Lin,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种并行化线性源转换标记网络（pLSTM），通过扩展多维线性RNN至有向无环图（DAG），解决了传统循环架构在处理多维数据时的顺序限制和长距离梯度问题，并在图像和分子图任务中展示了优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有循环架构（如xLSTM、Mamba）受限于序列或预定义顺序处理多维数据（如图像、分子图），而多维RNN（MDRNN）虽适合结构化数据，但面临长距离的梯度消失/爆炸问题。本文旨在将多维性扩展至线性RNN，以支持DAG并行化并解决上述问题。

Method: 提出pLSTM模型，通过源门、转换门和标记门作用于DAG的线图，实现类似并行关联扫描的并行化。针对规则网格（如1D/2D图像），使用einsum、拼接和填充实现对数时间计算，并通过定向传播（P-mode）和扩散分布（D-mode）两种模式控制梯度传播。

Result: 在合成的箭头指向外推任务中，pLSTM能泛化至更大图像尺寸，而Transformer外推能力不足。在分子图和计算机视觉基准测试中，pLSTM表现优异，验证了其长距离依赖处理能力。

Conclusion: pLSTM通过DAG并行化和双模式梯度控制，有效解决了多维数据的长距离依赖问题，在结构化数据任务中性能超越Transformer，为处理复杂数据提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

Conclusion: SIMSHIFT为工业仿真分布偏移研究提供基准，领域适应方法的应用揭示了神经代理模型在复杂工业场景中的改进方向与待解决问题。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

Motivation: 现有大模型微调方法因内存开销过高难以普及，尤其对领域特定任务和普通用户存在显著资源壁垒。

Method: 1. 基于激活感知SVD构建轻量级任务模拟器 2. 在模拟器上执行LoRA微调 3. 设计补偿算法修正LoRA模块与原模型的对齐偏差

Result: 在跨数据集/模态实验中优于基线，未量化情况下单张24GB GPU可微调38B模型，验证框架普适性与实用性。

Conclusion: EMLoC突破大模型个性化适配的内存限制，为普通用户提供高效可行的模型定制解决方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

Motivation: 现有随机优化方法常依赖强假设（如方差有界、均方光滑性），且需显式问题参数（如Lipschitz常数）。本文旨在开发更通用、自适应的优化方法，减少假设限制并提升实际适用性。

Method: 提出动态参数更新的归一化随机一阶方法，结合Polyak动量、多外推动量及递归动量，无需显式问题参数（如噪声边界），适用于更广泛的问题场景。

Result: 在重尾噪声和弱平均光滑性条件下，方法的一阶Oracle复杂度优于或匹配文献最佳结果。数值实验表明其实际性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法在理论和实验上均表现出优越性：适应更弱假设、参数自更新、复杂度更优，为随机优化问题提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods
with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for
solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically
updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of
problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We
establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate
stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average
smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used
bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds
either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature.
Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: 量子方法有效解决了能源协调中的信息与计算瓶颈，显著提升系统可靠性和可扩展性，为电力系统优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Price signals from distribution networks (DNs) guide energy communities (ECs)
to adjust energy usage, enabling effective coordination for reliable power
system operation. However, this coordination faces significant challenges due
to the limited availability of information (i.e., only the aggregated energy
usage of ECs is available to DNs), and the high computational burden of
accounting for uncertainties and the associated risks through numerous
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a quantum learning and
estimation approach to enhance coordination between DNs and ECs. Specifically,
leveraging advanced quantum properties such as quantum superposition and
entanglement, we develop a hybrid quantum temporal convolutional network-long
short-term memory (Q-TCN-LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end mapping between
ECs' responses and the price incentives from DNs. Moreover, we develop a
quantum estimation method based on quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and two
phase-rotation circuits to significantly accelerate the optimization process
under numerous uncertainty scenarios. Numerical experiments demonstrate that,
compared to classical neural networks, the proposed Q-TCN-LSTM model improves
the mapping accuracy by 69.2% while reducing the model size by 99.75% and the
computation time by 93.9%. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulation, QAE
achieves comparable accuracy with a dramatic reduction in computational time
(up to 99.99%) and requires significantly fewer computational resources.

Motivation: 现有随机梯度方法对动量项动态变化及梯度假设（如零阶方法中的有偏/无界方差）处理不足，需建立更通用的理论框架。

Method: 提出含时变动量项的随机优化统一算法，允许梯度估计存在偏差且条件方差无界增长，特别适用于仅通过双函数评估估计梯度的零阶方法。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了主流动量算法，扩展了理论适用范围，为含复杂噪声的优化问题（如零阶方法）提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization
that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient
depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but
also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes
the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation,
the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration
counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in
the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that
grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is
crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where
the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified
algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar
Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic
gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the
SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is
impracticable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示（INRs）虽展现潜力，但其基础能力、隐式偏差及扩展特性尚不明确。本文旨在通过实验揭示不同INR和网格表示的能力分配机制，并指导其适用场景。

Method: 通过分层评估模型规模、信号类型及带宽对性能的影响，在2D/3D真实与合成信号上测试过拟合与泛化任务（如断层扫描、超分辨率、去噪），对比INRs与网格表示的表现。

Result: 多数任务中，带插值的正则化网格训练更快且质量优于同参数量的INRs；INRs仅在拟合低维结构（如形状轮廓）时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 网格表示在多数场景下更高效，而INRs适用于低维结构信号处理。研究为INRs的未来应用方向提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently shown impressive
results, but their fundamental capacity, implicit biases, and scaling behavior
remain poorly understood. We investigate the performance of diverse INRs across
a suite of 2D and 3D real and synthetic signals with varying effective
bandwidth, as well as both overfitting and generalization tasks including
tomography, super-resolution, and denoising. By stratifying performance
according to model size as well as signal type and bandwidth, our results shed
light on how different INR and grid representations allocate their capacity. We
find that, for most tasks and signals, a simple regularized grid with
interpolation trains faster and to higher quality than any INR with the same
number of parameters. We also find limited settings where INRs outperform grids
-- namely fitting signals with underlying lower-dimensional structure such as
shape contours -- to guide future use of INRs towards the most advantageous
applications. Code and synthetic signals used in our analysis are available at

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在高噪声场景（如冷冻电镜图像）中效果有限，但此类数据具有冗余性，可通过类平均方法降噪。如何结合深度学习与冗余信息利用是研究动机。

Method: 设计基于Transformer的架构，集成传统类平均方法的三步骤（聚类、对齐、平均），实现端到端的联合优化。

Result: 合成数据测试显示，在信噪比0.03时，相对单图DNN的均方误差降低45%。

Conclusion: 该架构有效融合传统冗余信息利用与深度学习，显著提升冷冻电镜图像在极低信噪比下的去噪能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks~(DNNs) have proven powerful for denoising, but they are
ultimately of limited use in high-noise settings, such as for cryogenic
electron microscopy~(cryo-EM) projection images. In this setting, however,
datasets contain a large number of projections of the same molecule, each taken
from a different viewing direction. This redundancy of information is useful in
traditional denoising techniques known as class averaging methods, where images
are clustered, aligned, and then averaged to reduce the noise level. We present
a neural network architecture based on transformers that extends these class
averaging methods by simultaneously clustering, aligning, and denoising cryo-EM
images. Results on synthetic data show accurate denoising performance using
this architecture, reducing the relative mean squared error (MSE) single-image
DNNs by $45\%$ at a signal-to-noise (SNR) of $0.03$.

*Jiaqi Wu,Jiahong Ouyang,Farshad Moradi,Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi,Greg Zaharchuk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究比较了基于扩散模型和非扩散模型的深度学习方法在癫痫患者MRI到PET图像合成中的表现，发现扩散模型在纯MRI输入时效果最佳，而结合1%低剂量PET后所有模型性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FDG PET在癫痫患者成像中存在辐射剂量问题，且现有方法未充分探索生成式AI（如扩散模型）在MRI到PET合成中的应用及针对癫痫人群的临床评估。

Method: 使用52例同步PET/MRI数据（40训练/2验证/10测试），对比两种分数扩散模型（SGM-KD、SGM-VP）和Transformer-Unet模型，评估指标包括图像质量指标及临床代谢不对称性指标。

Result: SGM-KD在纯MRI输入时表现最优（全脑SUVR误差最小，组内相关系数最高）；加入1%低剂量PET后，所有模型定量与视觉质量均显著提升且性能相当。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在纯MRI到PET合成中潜力显著，而结合极低剂量PET时，三类模型均可高精度合成全剂量FDG-PET图像。

Abstract: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the
most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both
brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in
this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic
quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using
advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to
clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the
performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the
MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous
PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three
different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras
Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a
Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as
well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence
Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic
asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The
SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing
PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in
whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass
correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the
inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for
quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great
potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can
synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MindGrab是一种参数和内存高效的深度全卷积模型，用于多模态头图像的颅骨剥离，在保持最先进精度的同时显著降低资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有颅骨剥离方法在跨模态适应性和计算资源消耗方面存在不足，需开发更高效、通用的解决方案。

Method: 基于频谱解释的扩张卷积架构设计，完全使用模态无关的合成数据训练，通过参数优化实现模型轻量化。

Result: 在606例多模态脑扫描测试中，Dice评分达95.9（SD=1.6），参数减少95%，推理速度提升2倍以上，内存占用降低50%，在非高端GPU设备表现优异。

Conclusion: MindGrab以极低资源消耗实现与当前最佳方法相当的精度，其开源实现（brainchop）显著提升了算法可及性和临床应用潜力。

Abstract: We developed MindGrab, a parameter- and memory-efficient deep
fully-convolutional model for volumetric skull-stripping in head images of any
modality. Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated
convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data.
MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain
scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip
dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using
Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a
mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities,
significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05;
BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352),
MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the
tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab
utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This
efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on
GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x
memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including
systems without high-end GPUs. MindGrab delivers state-of-the-art accuracy with
dramatically lower resource demands, supported in brainchop-cli
(https://pypi.org/project/brainchop/) and at brainchop.org.

### [222] [DPUV4E: High-Throughput DPU Architecture Design for CNN on Versal ACAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11441)
*Guoyu Li,Pengbo Zheng,Jian Weng,Enshan Yang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 本文提出针对AMD Versal ACAP架构的DPUV4E设计，通过优化计算单元与数据流，显著提升AI引擎性能与能效，解决内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FPGA在平衡性能与灵活性时受限于片上资源，而AMD Versal ACAP架构虽专为AI优化，却因内存带宽不足导致AI引擎理论性能未完全释放。

Method: 设计DPUV4E架构，包含2PE至8PE配置，采用Conv PE和DWC PE两种计算单元优化数据复用，并扩展PE功能以利用AI引擎处理非卷积操作。

Result: 实验显示，相比传统FPGA方案，TOPS/W提升8.6倍，DSP/LUT使用分别减少95.8%和44.7%，单批次延迟降至68.5%，深度卷积模型吞吐量最高提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: DPUV4E通过硬件架构与数据流协同优化，有效克服Versal平台带宽限制，显著提升能效与计算性能，适用于多样化模型加速。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision
applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency,
have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems.
However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and
versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture,
tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high
computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient
memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical
performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture,
providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS).
We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different
computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes
the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally,
we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional
operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that
compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of
traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT
usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For
end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for
depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识图谱嵌入（KGE）和贝叶斯推理的车道变换预测系统，通过真实硬件实验验证，可提前3-4秒预测目标车辆变道行为，并触发纵向制动确保安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车道变换预测研究多局限于模拟或数据集，缺乏实际道路部署验证。本文旨在填补算法进展与真实场景应用之间的鸿沟。

Method: 系统分为感知模块（环境感知、特征提取与语言类别转换）和预测模块（预训练KGE模型结合贝叶斯推理预测变道行为，并转化为纵向制动控制）。

Result: 真实实验表明，系统可提前3-4秒预测目标车辆变道，为自车提供充足反应时间，同时保障目标车辆安全完成变道。

Conclusion: 通过硬件验证的实时预测系统有效缩小了算法与道路部署的差距，证明了知识驱动模型与纵向制动协同在安全协同驾驶中的可行性。

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last
couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results
obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road
deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a
lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and
Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking
action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our
architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the
environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into
linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a
pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model
to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into
longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation
demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle's lane
change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient
time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely.

Conclusion: 该架构实现了检测系统内嵌学习能力，为新型极端边缘实时信息处理系统奠定了基础，标志着向终端智能迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Advances in sensor technology and automation have ushered in an era of data
abundance, where the ability to identify and extract relevant information in
real time has become increasingly critical. Traditional filtering approaches,
which depend on a priori knowledge, often struggle to adapt to dynamic or
unanticipated data features. Machine learning offers a compelling
alternative-particularly when training can occur directly at or near the
detector. This paper presents a digital hardware architecture designed for
real-time neural network training, specifically optimized for high-throughput
data ingestion. The design is described in an implementation-independent
manner, with detailed analysis of each architectural component and their
performance implications. Through system parameterization, the study explores
trade-offs between processing speed, model complexity, and hardware resource
utilization. Practical examples illustrate how these parameters affect
applicability across various use cases. A proof-of-concept implementation on an
FPGA demonstrates in-situ training, confirming that computational accuracy is
preserved relative to conventional software-based approaches. Moreover,
resource estimates indicate that current-generation FPGAs can train networks of
approximately 3,500 neurons per chip. The architecture is both scalable and
adaptable, representing a significant advancement toward integrating learning
directly within detector systems and enabling a new class of extreme-edge,
real-time information processing.

*Jiajun He,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文针对端到端语音识别模型在罕见词（尤其是同音异形词）识别上的不足，提出了一种结合音素增强多模态融合与保留概率机制的改进方法（PMF-CEC），在保持推理速度的同时显著降低错误率，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR后处理方法ED-CEC在纠正发音相似但拼写不同的罕见词时准确率较低，且存在错误检测过敏感的问题，需通过融合音素信息及优化检测机制来改进。

Method: 在ED-CEC基础上，提出音素增强多模态融合（PMF-CEC）方法以区分同音词，并引入保留概率机制过滤低置信度编辑操作，减少过检测。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，PMF-CEC进一步降低错误率，在同音词纠正上优势显著，推理速度合理，且优于其他上下文偏置方法及部分大模型方法。

Conclusion: PMF-CEC通过音素融合与检测优化，在罕见词识别中实现更高准确率与鲁棒性，同时保持高效性，为ASR后处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often struggle to
accurately recognize rare words. Previously, we introduced an ASR
postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction
(ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and
technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC
achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low
when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different
spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal
fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis
of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words
and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection
module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention
probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores
below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error
detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that
our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further
reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger
advantage in correcting homophones. Moreover, our method outperforms other
contextual biasing methods, and remains valuable compared with LLM-based
methods in terms of faster inference and better robustness under large biasing
lists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽能保护隐私，但加剧了构音障碍及老年语音识别中的数据稀缺、分布不均和说话者异质性挑战，需通过正则化方法优化模型性能。

Method: 提出三级正则化联邦学习框架：1) 参数级正则化；2) 嵌入级正则化；3) 新型损失函数正则化，覆盖联邦学习不同层级。

Result: 在UASpeech和DementiaBank数据集上，正则化联邦学习系统比FedAvg基线词错误率绝对降低0.55%（相对2.13%），批量级通信频率可逼近集中训练效果。

Conclusion: 正则化联邦学习能有效解决隐私保护场景下的数据挑战，高频通信可缩小与集中训练的差距，为医疗语音识别提供可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of dysarthric and elderly speech remains challenging to
date. While privacy concerns have driven a shift from centralized approaches to
federated learning (FL) to ensure data confidentiality, this further
exacerbates the challenges of data scarcity, imbalanced data distribution and
speaker heterogeneity. To this end, this paper conducts a systematic
investigation of regularized FL techniques for privacy-preserving dysarthric
and elderly speech recognition, addressing different levels of the FL process
by 1) parameter-based, 2) embedding-based and 3) novel loss-based
regularization. Experiments on the benchmark UASpeech dysarthric and
DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest that regularized FL systems
consistently outperform the baseline FedAvg system by statistically significant
WER reductions of up to 0.55\% absolute (2.13\% relative). Further increasing
communication frequency to one exchange per batch approaches centralized
training performance.

Abstract: Automatic reading aloud evaluation can provide valuable support to teachers

multimodal approach that leverages audio and knowledge from text resources. In
particular, we explored the potential of using Whisper and instruction-tuned
large language models (LLMs) with prompts to improve transcriptions for child

Whisper and prompting LLM, compared to the baseline Whisper model without

Method: 通过听写测试评估五类MX的TTS模型质量，使用LLM将LaTeX转为英文发音，结合用户评分（MOS）和转录正确性指标，并与专家人工处理对比。

Result: TTS模型对MX的输出可理解性不足，不同模型和MX类别间差异显著；多数类别表现远逊于专家处理，LLM选择影响有限。

Conclusion: 需改进TTS模型对数学表达式的处理能力，以提升输出的可理解性和质量。

Abstract: There has been limited evaluation of advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
with Mathematical eXpressions (MX) as inputs. In this work, we design
experiments to evaluate quality and intelligibility of five TTS models through
listening and transcribing tests for various categories of MX. We use two Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate English pronunciation from LaTeX MX as TTS
models cannot process LaTeX directly. We use Mean Opinion Score from user
ratings and quantify intelligibility through transcription correctness using
three metrics. We also compare listener preference of TTS outputs with respect
to human expert rendition of same MX. Results establish that output of TTS
models for MX is not necessarily intelligible, the gap in intelligibility
varies across TTS models and MX category. For most categories, performance of
TTS models is significantly worse than that of expert rendition. The effect of
choice of LLM is limited. This establishes the need to improve TTS models for
MX.

Motivation: 传统多阶段ASR伪标签生成方法存在错误传播、信息丢失和优化不连贯问题，需简化流程并提高转录准确性。

Method: 使用文本或语音LLM对多ASR输出进行后处理，取代投票/仲裁机制，构建统一提示驱动框架以整合模型结果。

Result: LLM后处理显著提高转录准确性；基于其伪标签的半监督ASR模型在不同数据集上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM后处理能有效优化多ASR集成输出，生成高质量伪标签，为半监督ASR训练提供更优解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models rely on high-quality transcribed
data for effective training. Generating pseudo-labels for large unlabeled audio
datasets often relies on complex pipelines that combine multiple ASR outputs
through multi-stage processing, leading to error propagation, information loss
and disjoint optimization. We propose a unified multi-ASR prompt-driven
framework using postprocessing by either textual or speech-based large language
models (LLMs), replacing voting or other arbitration logic for reconciling the
ensemble outputs. We perform a comparative study of multiple architectures with
and without LLMs, showing significant improvements in transcription accuracy
compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we use the pseudo-labels
generated by the various approaches to train semi-supervised ASR models for
different datasets, again showing improved performance with textual and
speechLLM transcriptions compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有开源语音特征提取工具未经验证，可能无法公平捕获行为信息，导致跨人群和情境的可重复性及公平性问题，尤其在临床应用中可能引入偏见。

Method: 通过对比分析OpenSMILE和Praat两种工具提取的语音特征，评估其在自闭症青少年群体中的可靠性，并观察特征差异对模型性能的影响。

Result: 不同工具提取的特征存在显著差异，这些差异导致模型在不同情境和人口群体中的表现不一致，表明工具选择直接影响结果的公平性。

Conclusion: 需针对具体临床领域（如自闭症）验证语音处理工具，以确保机器学习模型的特征可靠性和公平性，减少跨工具和跨群体的偏差风险。

Abstract: Machine learning-based behavioral models rely on features extracted from
audio-visual recordings. The recordings are processed using open-source tools
to extract speech features for classification models. These tools often lack
validation to ensure reliability in capturing behaviorally relevant
information. This gap raises concerns about reproducibility and fairness across
diverse populations and contexts. Speech processing tools, when used outside of
their design context, can fail to capture behavioral variations equitably and
can then contribute to bias. We evaluate speech features extracted from two
widely used speech analysis tools, OpenSMILE and Praat, to assess their
reliability when considering adolescents with autism. We observed considerable
variation in features across tools, which influenced model performance across
context and demographic groups. We encourage domain-relevant verification to
enhance the reliability of machine learning models in clinical applications.

Abstract: Audio-recordings collected with a child-worn device are a fundamental tool in
child language research. Long-form recordings collected over whole days promise
to capture children's input and production with minimal observer bias, and
therefore high validity. The sheer volume of resulting data necessitates
automated analysis to extract relevant metrics for researchers and clinicians.
This paper summarizes collective knowledge on this technique, providing entry
points to existing resources. We also highlight various sources of error that
threaten the accuracy of automated annotations and the interpretation of
resulting metrics. To address this, we propose potential troubleshooting
metrics to help users assess data quality. While a fully automated quality
control system is not feasible, we outline practical strategies for researchers
to improve data collection and contextualize their analyses.

*Jianhong Yao,Yangming Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种高度量子化的模糊神经网络（HQFNN），将模糊推理流程嵌入浅层量子电路并结合轻量级CNN，在保持参数高效性的同时提升图像分类的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对深度学习视觉系统在噪声环境下置信度解释性差的问题，结合模糊推理的透明规则与量子电路的高效特征表达能力，开发兼具鲁棒性、可解释性和参数效率的混合模型。

Method: 通过角度重上传将图像特征映射为量子比特成员态，利用紧凑规则层优化振幅，采用聚类CNOT去模糊器生成清晰值，并与经典特征融合后进行分类。

Result: 在标准数据集上超越传统/模糊/量子基线模型，参数减少数个量级；噪声模拟显示准确率仅轻微下降；门数量分析验证模型对高维图像的可扩展性。

Conclusion: HQFNN为视觉任务提供了紧凑、可解释且抗噪声的量子模糊框架，为未来量子原生模糊学习系统建立了设计范式。

Abstract: Deep learning vision systems excel at pattern recognition yet falter when
inputs are noisy or the model must explain its own confidence. Fuzzy inference,
with its graded memberships and rule transparency, offers a remedy, while
parameterized quantum circuits can embed features in richly entangled Hilbert
spaces with striking parameter efficiency. Bridging these ideas, this study
introduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that
realises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples
the resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image
feature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated
angle reuploading. Then a compact rule layer refines these amplitudes, and a
clustered CNOT defuzzifier collapses them into one crisp value that is fused
with classical features before classification. Evaluated on standard image
benchmarks, HQFNN consistently surpasses classical, fuzzy enhanced and quantum
only baselines while using several orders of magnitude fewer trainable weights,
and its accuracy degrades only marginally under simulated depolarizing and
amplitude damping noise, evidence of intrinsic robustness. Gate count analysis
further shows that circuit depth grows sublinearly with input dimension,
confirming the model's practicality for larger images. These results position
the model as a compact, interpretable and noise tolerant alternative to
conventional vision backbones and provide a template for future quantum native
fuzzy learning frameworks.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于可区分性损失函数的变分量子纠错方法（VarQEC），通过优化编码电路以适配特定噪声结构，显著降低资源开销，并在实验中优于传统纠错码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子纠错码（如表面码）在早期容错设备中存在高资源开销问题，无法适应近期的实际需求。需针对特定噪声结构设计更高效的纠错方案。

Method: 提出可区分性损失函数作为机器学习目标，最大化噪声后量子态的可区分性，结合变分方法（VarQEC）搜索资源高效的编码电路。

Result: 所设计的纠错码在理论和实践中均表现优异，在多种场景下超越标准码，并在IBM和IQM量子设备上完成概念验证。

Conclusion: VarQEC为噪声特定优化的量子纠错提供了高效框架，验证了其在真实硬件中的实用性，为近量子设备纠错开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for protecting quantum information
against decoherence. Traditional codes like the surface code require
substantial overhead, making them impractical for near-term, early
fault-tolerant devices. We propose a novel objective function for tailoring
error correction codes to specific noise structures by maximizing the
distinguishability between quantum states after a noise channel, ensuring
efficient recovery operations. We formalize this concept with the
distinguishability loss function, serving as a machine learning objective to
discover resource-efficient encoding circuits optimized for given noise
characteristics. We implement this methodology using variational techniques,
termed variational quantum error correction (VarQEC). Our approach yields codes
with desirable theoretical and practical properties and outperforms standard
codes in various scenarios. We also provide proof-of-concept demonstrations on
IBM and IQM hardware devices, highlighting the practical relevance of our
procedure.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出一种改进的变分自编码器方法，通过量子态重构解码器和概率损失函数，实现了对量子系统物理特征的无监督可解释学习。该方法在自旋模型和里德堡原子阵列实验中成功揭示了相结构，无需先验知识或序参量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变分自编码器在处理量子数据时忽略其概率特性，导致物理特征提取不准确。量子系统的内在随机性和复杂相关性需要新的建模方法。

Method: 提出两个关键改进：1) 能精确重构量子态的物理感知解码器；2) 针对量子数据特性设计的概率损失函数。通过量子自旋模型和实验数据进行验证。

Result: 在基准模型中识别出传统方法失效的机制，实验数据中自主发现里德堡原子阵列相变，无需哈密顿量、标签或序参量先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子系统研究提供了无监督、可解释的工具，证明物理约束的VAE架构在科学发现中的有效性，拓展了可解释机器学习在量子领域的应用。

Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for
scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders
(VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some
input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study.
Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations
relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability
distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence
account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have
been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its
probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical
descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to
learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of
faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this
task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard
methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain
meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom
arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to
prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters,
highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the
study of quantum systems.

Specifically, we introduce a prompt template designed to improve the quality

produce reliable results. Through experiments conducted on two state-of-the-art
LLMs using the HumanEval dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
widely studied zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in terms of the
Pass@k metric. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements with
significantly reduced token usage compared to the CoT approach, making it both
effective and resource-efficient, thereby lowering the computational demands
and improving the eco-footprint of LLM capabilities. These findings highlight
the potential of tailored prompting strategies to optimize code generation
performance, paving the way for broader applications in AI-driven programming
tasks.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究通过实验验证了'Follow-the-Sun'（FtS）策略在降低AI模型训练碳排放中的有效性，相比无策略和其他两种现有方法，FtS平均减少14.6%碳排放且保持训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献缺乏FtS策略对AI工作负载碳足迹影响的实际证据，尤其在AI高能耗争议背景下，需科学验证其有效性。

Method: 在部分合成场景中，使用2021年欧洲七城市历史碳强度数据，对比无策略、FtS、Flexible Start及Pause and Resume四种策略下四种异常检测算法的碳排放差异。

Result: FtS策略平均减少14.6%碳排放（峰值16.3%），同时未显著增加训练时间，表现优于其他两种策略。

Conclusion: FtS可有效降低AI训练碳足迹，其动态迁移工作负载至清洁能源区域的机制具有实际应用潜力，未来可扩展至其他计算密集型任务。

Abstract: 'Follow-the-Sun' (FtS) is a theoretical computational model aimed at
minimizing the carbon footprint of computer workloads. It involves dynamically
moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and
energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power
consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive
debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of
training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the
advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this
paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic
scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the
anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in
four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the
state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our
experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for
seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only
achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of
16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training.

analyze the power of LLMs to understand some common visualizations by answering
simple questions. Our study shows that LLMs could generate code for some
visualizations as well as answer questions about them. However, LLMs also have
several limitations. We believe that our insights can be used to improve both

Motivation: 现有自动化测试方法存在测试局部性、可靠性不足及业务逻辑盲区等缺陷，无法匹敌人类工程师的测试能力。

Method: 通过代码形式化转换生成API与数据库行为定理，使用LLM证明器进行验证：定理成立则逻辑正确，否定成立则确认缺陷，无法判定时请求人工介入。

Result: 在真实后端系统中验证了50%以上测试需求，每个API验证成本仅2.19美元，证明该方法可自动化半数测试工作且具备规模化潜力。

Conclusion: 结合形式化方法与LLM的AI驱动测试框架展现了规模化应用前景，随着模型进化将显著提升软件工程生产力。

Abstract: Software testing plays a critical role in ensuring that systems behave as
intended. However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the
capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality,
lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type
systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our
pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of
APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a
theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no
further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it
confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is
required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it
can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half
of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an
average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly
more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through
parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable,
AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering
productivity as models continue to advance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能自动转换传统代码至现代语言，但转换结果的正确性缺乏可靠验证机制，需确保语义等效性。

Method: 通过符号执行自动生成COBOL单元测试并模拟外部资源调用，生成等效JUnit测试用例进行语义对比验证。

Result: 开发出工具可检测转换代码差异，定位错误并提供修复建议，同时反馈至AI模型以优化后续转换效果。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决LLM代码转换的可信度问题，形成验证-修复-反馈的闭环优化体系。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI techniques
have made it feasible to translate enterpriselevel code from legacy languages
such as COBOL to modern languages such as Java or Python. While the results of
LLM-based automatic transformation are encouraging, the resulting code cannot
be trusted to correctly translate the original code. We propose a framework and
a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The
results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide
feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a
symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests
for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We
generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run
them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术准备度评估未涵盖AI特有因素（如透明度、人机协作），可能导致军事AI部署风险。需建立专门框架确保AI系统的成熟度与可信度。

Method: 设计AI准备度框架（类比TRL但AI定制化），整合现有数据评估工具与测试方法，从性能、透明度和人机整合维度评估系统成熟度。

Conclusion: 该框架填补AI军事化部署的评估缺口，通过结构化指标提升决策信心，推动国防技术风险管理领域发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat
systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready
presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments
fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in
deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity
and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is
that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness
Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability,
safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and
testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term
implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with
clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary
standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed
with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and
risk assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对大语言模型在嵌入式系统开发（如硬件编程、电路设计、跨平台迁移）能力的评估，需填补这一空白。

Method: 提出EmbedAgent框架（模拟嵌入式开发角色）和Embedbench基准（含126个案例，覆盖3硬件平台和9组件），测试10个主流LLM，并设计检索增强生成和编译器反馈策略优化模型。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在提供原理图时通过率55.6%，无原理图时50.0%；跨平台任务中Raspberry Pi Pico（73.8%）表现优于ESP-IDF（29.4%）。优化策略使Arduino到ESP32迁移准确率从21.4%提升至27.8%。

Conclusion: LLM在嵌入式开发中潜力有限，需领域优化策略；通用模型未能有效利用预训练知识，而推理模型易过度复杂化。提出的策略显著提升性能，但任务难度仍较高。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, yet few
benchmarks assess their capabilities in embedded system development.In this
paper, we introduce EmbedAgent, a paradigm designed to simulate real-world
roles in embedded system development, such as Embedded System Programmer,
Architect, and Integrator. This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks
that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more
comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these
tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded
system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform migration.Embedbench
consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware
platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover
several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases,
DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic
information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In
the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance
with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8%
pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4%
pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like
DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this
domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge
during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies:
retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM
performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with
Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without.
Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from
21.4% to 27.8%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly integrated into software
engineering and maintenance tasks due to their high performance with software
engineering tasks and robust understanding of modern programming languages.
However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages
remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or
containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To
assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM
evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy
languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation
methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of
comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present
preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of
legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上，错误率从65%降至2%；保守阈值下错误率为0%且仍覆盖15.6%的提示。剩余错误主要源于提示误解而非随机噪声。

Conclusion: 功能聚类无需修改模型即可提升代码生成可靠性，未来需关注规范清晰度。方法适用于闭源API及未来模型，为自主代码生成提供实用路径。

Abstract: Modern code-generation LLMs can already solve a large fraction of programming
problems, yet they still hallucinate subtle bugs that make their outputs unsafe
for autonomous deployment. We present functional clustering, a black-box
wrapper that eliminates nearly all hallucination-induced errors while providing
a tunable confidence score. The wrapper samples many candidate programs,
executes each on a self-generated test suite, and clusters candidates whose I/O
behavior is identical; the empirical mass of the largest cluster serves as an
exact confidence estimate. A single scalar threshold on this estimate lets
users trade coverage for reliability with exponential guarantees. On
LiveCodeBench our verifier preserves baseline pass@1 on solvable tasks yet
slashes the error rate of returned answers from ~65% to 2%, and drives it to 0%
at a conservative threshold while still answering 15.6% of prompts. Manual
audits show that the few residual mistakes stem from prompt misinterpretation,
not random generation noise, narrowing future work to specification clarity.
Because the method requires only sampling and sandbox execution, it applies
unchanged to closed-source APIs and future models, offering a practical path
toward dependable, autonomous code generation. Our code is available on Github
(https://github.com/20ChaituR/functional-clustering).

### [248] [Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation -- A Systematic Analysis of the Paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11022)
*Shivani Shukla,Himanshu Joshi,Romilla Syed*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型(LLMs)在代码迭代改进过程中，关键安全漏洞增加37.6%，挑战了LLM自动优化提升安全性的假设，强调人类验证的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM迭代反馈过程中代码安全漏洞的演变规律，填补现有研究对AI生成代码安全退化机制认知的空白。

Method: 使用4种提示策略对400个代码样本进行40轮改进实验，系统分析不同迭代策略下的漏洞演化特征。

Result: 仅5次迭代即出现37.6%的关键漏洞增长，不同提示策略产生差异化漏洞模式，证明自动优化可能系统性降低代码安全性。

Conclusion: 代码安全不能依赖LLM自主迭代，必须建立人工验证机制阻断漏洞传导，研究提出了具体的开发实践指南以控制风险。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models(LLMs) for code generation has
transformed software development, yet little attention has been given to how
security vulnerabilities evolve through iterative LLM feedback. This paper
analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled
experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four
distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical
vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability
patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence
challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security
and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose
practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the
need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the
paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial
code "improvements".

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出Librarian方法和Minicode基准，通过代码重构生成可重用库，在压缩率和正确性上优于现有代码代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码代理虽能解决孤立编程问题，但缺乏支持代码可扩展性和可重用性的重构能力，需研究其重构潜力。

Method: Librarian采用样本生成-重排方法创建可重用库；Minicode基准要求将多个独立方案重构为统一库以评估性能。

Result: Librarian在Minicode上实现1.6-2倍代码压缩率提升，同时提高正确性，优于当前最优代码代理。

Conclusion: 通过方法创新与基准验证，证明代码代理可有效支持可维护性重构，开源资源将促进后续研究。

Abstract: Maintainable and general software allows developers to build robust
applications efficiently, yet achieving these qualities often requires
refactoring specialized solutions into reusable components. This challenge
becomes particularly relevant as code agents become increasingly accurate at
solving isolated programming problems. We investigate code agents' capacity to
refactor code in ways supporting growth and reusability. We present both a
method and a benchmark for refactoring: Librarian, a sample-and-rerank method
for generating reusable libraries, and Minicode, a benchmark where code agents
must minimize and refactor multiple independent solutions into a joint library.
Compared to state-of-the-art code agents, Librarian achieves strong results on
both compression and correctness on Minicode, obtaining compression rates
1.6-2x better than coding agents while also improving correctness. We
open-source our code and benchmark at https://code-refactor.github.io/.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出Code Researcher，首个针对系统代码修复的深度研究代理，通过多步骤语义、模式及提交历史分析，显著提升崩溃解决率至58%，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的编码代理在系统代码修复中效果有限，因其规模大、复杂度高，需结合代码库全局上下文与提交历史进行深度研究。

Method: 设计Code Researcher代理，通过多步骤推理收集代码语义、模式及提交历史等结构化上下文，并利用内存存储合成补丁。

Result: 在Linux内核崩溃基准测试中，Code Researcher解决率达58%（SWE-agent为37.5%），平均探索10个文件（SWE-agent仅1.33个），并在多媒体软件中验证通用性。

Conclusion: 全局上下文收集与多维度推理对大型代码库修复至关重要，Code Researcher通过深度探索与结构化分析显著优于现有方法，且具备跨项目泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based coding agents have shown promising results
on coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness on systems code remains
underexplored. Due to the size and complexities of systems code, making changes
to a systems codebase is a daunting task, even for humans. It requires
researching about many pieces of context, derived from the large codebase and
its massive commit history, before making changes. Inspired by the recent
progress on deep research agents, we design the first deep research agent for
code, called Code Researcher, and apply it to the problem of generating patches
for mitigating crashes reported in systems code. Code Researcher performs
multi-step reasoning about semantics, patterns, and commit history of code to
gather sufficient context. The context is stored in a structured memory which
is used for synthesizing a patch. We evaluate Code Researcher on kBenchSyz, a
benchmark of Linux kernel crashes, and show that it significantly outperforms
strong baselines, achieving a crash-resolution rate of 58%, compared to 37.5%
by SWE-agent. On an average, Code Researcher explores 10 files in each
trajectory whereas SWE-agent explores only 1.33 files, highlighting Code
Researcher's ability to deeply explore the codebase. Through another experiment
on an open-source multimedia software, we show the generalizability of Code
Researcher. Our experiments highlight the importance of global context
gathering and multi-faceted reasoning for large codebases.

*Jiahui Geng,Fengyu Cai,Shaobo Cui,Qing Li,Liangwei Chen,Chenyang Lyu,Haonan Li,Derui Zhu,Walter Pretschner,Heinz Koeppl,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出首个多语言质量感知代码检索基准CoQuIR，覆盖正确性、效率等四大维度，测试发现现有模型常无法识别低质量代码，并通过新训练方法提升质量指标且不影响语义相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码检索基准仅关注功能相关性，忽视代码质量维度（如安全性、可维护性），导致检索系统可能返回低质量代码，需构建质量感知评估体系。

Method: 构建包含11种语言、13万代码片段的CoQuIR基准，设计Pairwise偏好准确率等质量指标，测试23个模型并探索基于合成数据的质量感知训练方法。

Result: 主流模型在质量维度表现欠佳（如无法区分漏洞代码），新训练方法使质量指标提升且保持语义相关性，下游代码生成实验验证有效性。

Conclusion: 整合质量信号能提升代码检索可靠性，CoQuIR为构建可信软件开发工具奠定基础，未来需持续探索质量感知的检索模型训练方法。

Abstract: Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code
reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily
emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software
quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale,
multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code
retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and
maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725
queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is
accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference
Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23
retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find
that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or
insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct
preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage
retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate
promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without
sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further
validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the
importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying
the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Lean 4生态系统的扩展，其庞大的库增加了用户导航和查找声明的难度，因此需要一种高效的搜索工具。

Method: 采用混合排名策略，结合多源语义嵌入模型（解析正式代码、文档、AI生成的非正式翻译及标题）、BM25+关键词匹配和基于PageRank的声明重要性评分。

Result: 开发了LeanExplore搜索引擎（含网站和Python接口），支持数据库下载与自托管，并可通过模型上下文协议（MCP）与大型语言模型集成。

Conclusion: LeanExplore通过增强声明搜索能力，优化了Lean 4工作流程，并为AI驱动的数学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: The expanding Lean 4 ecosystem poses challenges for navigating its vast
libraries. This paper introduces LeanExplore, a search engine for Lean 4
declarations. LeanExplore enables users to semantically search for statements,
both formally and informally, across select Lean 4 packages (including
Batteries, Init, Lean, Mathlib, PhysLean, and Std). This search capability is
powered by a hybrid ranking strategy, integrating scores from a multi-source
semantic embedding model (capturing conceptual meaning from formal Lean code,
docstrings, AI-generated informal translations, and declaration titles), BM25+
for keyword-based lexical relevance, and a PageRank-based score reflecting
declaration importance and interconnectedness. The search engine is accessible
via a dedicated website (https://www.leanexplore.com/) and a Python API
(https://github.com/justincasher/lean-explore). Furthermore, the database can
be downloaded, allowing users to self-host the service. LeanExplore integrates
easily with LLMs via the model context protocol (MCP), enabling users to chat
with an AI assistant about Lean declarations or utilize the search engine for
building theorem-proving agents. This work details LeanExplore's architecture,
data processing, functionalities, and its potential to enhance Lean 4 workflows

*Weibo Gao,Qi Liu,Rui Li,Yuze Zhao,Hao Wang,Linan Yre,Fangzhou Yao,Zheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出Coda框架，通过代码图转换和噪声信号处理，提升现有编程知识追踪（PKT）模型在噪声编程记录下的性能，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PKT研究主要关注代码内容与知识评估的隐式关系，但忽略了长期编程活动中的两类噪声信号：无关提交的不必要信号和微小修改的弱信号，这限制了模型的实际应用效果。

Method: Coda框架包含三部分：1) 将松散代码序列转换为紧凑代码图以识别不必要信号；2) 使用聚类感知GCN增强弱信号区分与聚类；3) 通过噪声特征约束和导航正则化优化适配器，修正噪声影响下的知识状态。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Coda在存在噪声的编程记录中有效执行PKT任务，性能显著优于典型基线模型。

Conclusion: Coda通过代码图结构化和噪声处理机制，解决了PKT中的噪声挑战，其模型无关性使其可适配现有解决方案，提升个性化编程教育效果。

Abstract: Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners'
mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities,
facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However,
current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code
content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals
in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated
submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge
significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue,
we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing
PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically,
Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a
compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be
identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a
cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak
signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight
yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization
with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization
term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning
that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing
PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets
demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of
noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出CodeMirage基准测试工具，覆盖10种编程语言和10个先进LLM生成的代码，评估现有AI代码检测器性能并揭示其优缺点，为开发鲁棒检测器提供支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成代码检测基准存在局限性，如编程语言覆盖少、依赖低性能生成模型，无法满足现实需求。需构建更全面的基准以推动检测器发展。

Method: CodeMirage通过三个创新构建基准：1) 覆盖10种主流编程语言；2) 包含原始与改写代码样本；3) 整合6大厂商10个生产级LLM（含推理与非推理模型）。使用三种互补指标，在四种现实配置下评估十类检测器。

Result: 实验揭示9个关键发现：现有检测器在跨语言泛化、抗代码改写、识别不同LLM变体等方面存在显著差异，同时暴露误报率高、依赖表面特征等缺陷。

Conclusion: CodeMirage为AI生成代码检测提供了严格且实用的测试平台，其评估结果指明当前技术瓶颈，并为未来开发鲁棒、可泛化的检测器提出关键挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to modern software
development, producing vast amounts of AI-generated source code. While these
models boost programming productivity, their misuse introduces critical risks,
including code plagiarism, license violations, and the propagation of insecure
programs. As a result, robust detection of AI-generated code is essential. To
support the development of such detectors, a comprehensive benchmark that
reflects real-world conditions is crucial. However, existing benchmarks fall
short -- most cover only a limited set of programming languages and rely on
less capable generative models. In this paper, we present CodeMirage, a
comprehensive benchmark that addresses these limitations through three major
advancements: (1) it spans ten widely used programming languages, (2) includes
both original and paraphrased code samples, and (3) incorporates outputs from
ten state-of-the-art production-level LLMs, including both reasoning and
non-reasoning models from six major providers. Using CodeMirage, we evaluate
ten representative detectors across four methodological paradigms under four
realistic evaluation configurations, reporting results using three
complementary metrics. Our analysis reveals nine key findings that uncover the
strengths and weaknesses of current detectors, and identify critical challenges
for future work. We believe CodeMirage offers a rigorous and practical testbed
to advance the development of robust and generalizable AI-generated code
detectors.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过增强LLM-as-a-Judge方法，结合双向功能匹配与逻辑表示，实现Bash代码生成的自动验证与优化，实验表明其评估指标与执行结果高度一致，并通过反思代码代理显著提升代码生成准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于表面相似性或执行测试的代码评估方法存在局限性，需开发无参考的自动验证方法以选择最佳模型并提升IT自动化事件修复的代码质量。

Method: 采用双向功能匹配与逻辑表示增强LLM-as-a-Judge，以执行无参考自动验证；利用执行结果作为基准评估指标，并构建反思代码代理进行反馈优化。

Result: LLM评估指标与执行结果达成高精度一致（最高提升基线8%），反思代理使代码优化准确率显著提高24%。

Conclusion: 增强的LLM评估方法结合执行基准与反馈优化，可有效提升自动代码生成质量，为IT自动化事件修复提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve
code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial
to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and
semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended.
There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity
metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2)
execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on
pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs
for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem
based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing
LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic
representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash
code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in
IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate
our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with
execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built
Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation
metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy)
for automatic code refinement.

Motivation: 现有基于漏洞检测的深度学习方法依赖大量标注数据与长时间训练，且新漏洞频发时需重复训练模型，导致资源成本高、前沿场景适用性受限。

Method: 采用YOTO（You Only Train Once）框架，通过参数融合集成多类型漏洞检测模型，避免联合训练过程。

Result: YOTO实现了对新漏洞的快速适配，减少模型更新的时间与计算资源需求。

Conclusion: YOTO通过参数融合机制突破传统深度学习方法的高成本限制，为动态漏洞检测场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the pervasive integration of computer applications across industries,
the presence of vulnerabilities within code bases poses significant risks. The
diversity of software ecosystems coupled with the intricate nature of modern
software engineering has led to a shift from manual code vulnerability
identification towards the adoption of automated tools. Among these, deep
learning-based approaches have risen to prominence due to their superior
accuracy; however, these methodologies encounter several obstacles. Primarily,
they necessitate extensive labeled datasets and prolonged training periods, and
given the rapid emergence of new vulnerabilities, the frequent retraining of
models becomes a resource-intensive endeavor, thereby limiting their
applicability in cutting-edge scenarios. To mitigate these challenges, this
paper introduces the \underline{\textbf{YOTO}}--\underline{\textbf{Y}}ou
\underline{\textbf{O}}nly \underline{\textbf{T}}rain \underline{\textbf{O}}nce
framework. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of multiple
types of vulnerability detection models via parameter fusion, eliminating the
need for joint training. Consequently, YOTO enables swift adaptation to newly
discovered vulnerabilities, significantly reducing both the time and
computational resources required for model updates.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用模型上下文协议（MCP）替代显式语义建模，使LLM能直接调用工业系统功能，并通过实验室原型验证了其在自动化中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于本体或语义模型的能力表示方法需大量人工且难以被LLM直接利用，限制了工业自动化的灵活性。

Method: 通过MCP标准化接口暴露资源功能，使用通用LLM进行多步骤流程规划、约束处理及MCP接口调用。

Result: 实验表明LLM可通过MCP成功执行复杂任务，无需依赖显式语义模型即可实现灵活工业自动化。

Conclusion: MCP为LLM驱动的生产系统提供了无需显式建模的外部工具集成基础，具有进一步探索价值。

Abstract: Explicit modeling of capabilities and skills -- whether based on ontologies,
Asset Administration Shells, or other technologies -- requires considerable
manual effort and often results in representations that are not easily
accessible to Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work-in-progress paper, we
present an alternative approach based on the recently introduced Model Context
Protocol (MCP). MCP allows systems to expose functionality through a
standardized interface that is directly consumable by LLM-based agents. We
conduct a prototypical evaluation on a laboratory-scale manufacturing system,
where resource functions are made available via MCP. A general-purpose LLM is
then tasked with planning and executing a multi-step process, including
constraint handling and the invocation of resource functions via MCP. The
results indicate that such an approach can enable flexible industrial
automation without relying on explicit semantic models. This work lays the
basis for further exploration of external tool integration in LLM-driven
production systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种将NL2SQL数据集自动生成NL2API数据集的方法，测试发现当前LLMs在复杂API调用任务中表现欠佳，任务完成率最高仅50%，揭示工具调用能力存在显著改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级LLM系统需与庞大复杂的API集合交互，但缺乏符合该场景的数据集。研究旨在通过现有NL2SQL数据集自动构建NL2API数据集，以评估和改进LLMs的API调用能力。

Method: 开发数据生成管道，利用SQL查询语法构建功能等效的API调用序列。基于BIRD-SQL数据集生成2500+可调用API工具集，并将自然语言查询与API调用序列配对。

Result: 测试10个公共LLMs发现：任务完成率仅7-47%（ReACT代理提升至50%）；工具数量/名称混淆显著影响性能；模型对SQL的利用能力优于API调用。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在意图识别、嵌套函数调用等工具调用任务上存在明显缺陷，最佳表现仍无法满足实际需求，表明工具调用能力仍需重大技术突破。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are routinely deployed as agentic systems, with
access to tools that interact with live environments to accomplish tasks. In
enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that
can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to
create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL
(Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create
NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation
pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally
equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest
NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be
served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries
from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this
collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models
struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent
detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find
that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending
on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are
employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best
task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective
general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement
in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed
ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available
as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation. We compare the
performance of models on the original SQL generation tasks and find that
current models are sometimes able to exploit SQL better than APIs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的互监督学习框架（MSL），通过Translator和Tester的协同验证与进化，解决了顺序到并行代码转换中的功能等效性问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU高性能计算的普及推动了并行编程需求，但现有基于机器学习的顺序到并行代码转换方法面临数据稀缺和功能等效性不足的挑战，尤其是反向翻译方法无法保证代码功能等效。

Method: MSL框架包含Translator（代码转换模型）和Tester（测试生成模型），通过迭代的Co-verify（验证过滤功能等效代码）和Co-evolve（相互生成数据增强）步骤，实现两者的协同进化。

Result: 实验表明，MSL将Qwen2.5-Coder的Pass@1提升28.91%，Tester性能提升68.90%，在BLEU和CodeBLEU分数上分别超过CodeRosetta 1.56和6.92，性能接近DeepSeek-R1和GPT-4。

Conclusion: MSL通过互监督机制有效解决了功能等效性问题，在代码转换任务中实现了显著性能提升，且优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the
widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the
inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated
sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant
challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.
Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to
ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose
a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel
code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of
two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of
Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate
data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests
to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving
the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented
input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型在编程竞赛中仍显著落后于人类顶尖选手，尤其在算法推理与复杂案例分析上存在局限，高表现主要来自工具增强而非推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对近期关于大语言模型(LLMs)在编程竞赛中超越人类精英的论断，本文通过结合国际算法竞赛奖牌得主的专业知识，重新评估LLMs与人类专家的能力差异及现存缺陷。

Method: 构建持续更新的LiveCodeBench Pro基准(含Codeforces/ICPC/IOI题目)，由奥赛奖牌得主进行算法分类标注，并对模型失败案例进行逐行归因分析。

Result: 前沿模型在中等难度题仅53%通过率，难题0%通过率；LLMs擅长实现密集型问题，但在算法推理与复杂案例分析中频繁生成错误结论，高表现主要依赖实现精度与工具支持。

Conclusion: LiveCodeBench Pro揭示了LLMs与人类顶尖水平的显著差距，强调需通过细粒度诊断改进代码推理能力，当前模型优势并非源于高级推理能力。

Abstract: Recent reports claim that large language models (LLMs) now outperform elite
humans in competitive programming. Drawing on knowledge from a group of
medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim,
examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still
remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from
Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the
likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every
problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of
failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find
that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external
tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems
and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find
that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced
algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently
incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by
implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning.
LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster
levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in
code-centric LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出ReVeal框架，通过多轮强化学习结合代码生成与显式自我验证，提升大语言模型的推理能力和验证可靠性，在代码生成任务中显著超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的验证方法缺乏真实环境反馈和显式验证优化，导致自我验证不可靠。需解决验证信号不足及验证过程未针对性优化的问题。

Method: ReVeal框架采用多轮强化学习，交替执行代码生成、自主测试用例生成、外部工具调用验证，并通过密集单步奖励的定制RL算法优化模型。

Result: 在LiveCodeBench上Pass@k指标显著提升，推理时随轮次增加持续改进代码质量，最终超越DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B模型。

Conclusion: ReVeal通过协同优化生成与验证能力，证明其作为可扩展框架在构建自主AI代理中的有效性，拓展了基础模型的推理边界。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome
rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool
interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification
signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification,
leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we
propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves
code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation.
ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools
for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm
with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a
model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding
the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains
in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper
inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns
increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B.
These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective
paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.

### [263] [Leveraging GPT-4 for Vulnerability-Witnessing Unit Test Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11559)
*Gábor Antal,Dénes Bán,Martin Isztin,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究评估GPT-4在自动生成漏洞相关单元测试的能力，发现其能生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，且测试模板可经人工微调后用于漏洞检测，支持其在半自动化测试流程中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件测试是质量保障的关键环节，但手动创建测试用例成本高昂。研究旨在探索通用大模型（如GPT-4）能否通过自动化生成单元测试，辅助开发者高效识别和修复漏洞。

Method: 基于VUL4J数据集的真实漏洞及修复代码，分析GPT-4生成测试用例的语法/语义正确性，重点考察代码上下文影响、模型自纠错能力及生成测试用例的主观可用性。

Result: GPT-4无需领域预训练即可生成66.5%语法正确的测试用例，但仅7.5%的修复语义正确性可自动验证；主观评估表明其生成的测试模板可通过少量人工调整转化为有效漏洞见证测试。

Conclusion: GPT-4虽无法完全自主生成功能完备的测试，但在半自动化测试生成中具有显著价值，可作为漏洞缓解证据的初步生成工具。

Abstract: In the life-cycle of software development, testing plays a crucial role in
quality assurance. Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents
regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the
software are identified and effectively fixed. However, creating such tests is
a complex, resource-consuming manual process. To help developers and security
experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of
one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective
of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real
vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can
generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code
before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on
the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction
ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results
indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\% of the
time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of
the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\% of the cases, our
subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that
can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests
with relatively minimal manual effort.
  Therefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4
can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It
may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant
role in a partially automated process.

*Gábor Antal,Bence Bogenfürst,Rudolf Ferenc,Péter Hegedűs*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4o在修复Java漏洞中的表现，发现其平均性能比GPT-4低11.9%，但能修复更多独特漏洞。CVE信息显著提升修复率，结合手动代码上下文效果最佳，集成提示策略使修复率提升至62%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLM）在自动化漏洞修复（AVR）中的潜力，分析不同上下文信息（如CVE、代码上下文）对GPT-4o修复能力的影响，并与早期GPT-4结果对比。

Method: 使用Vul4J数据集，对比GPT-4o与GPT-4在相同提示下的表现；设计9种含不同上下文信息的提示（如CWE/CVE、手动提取代码），在42个漏洞上各执行3次，通过自动化测试框架验证修复结果。

Result: GPT-4o平均修复率低于GPT-4，但三轮运行后修复的独特漏洞多10.5%。CVE信息提升修复效果，任务描述长度影响小。结合CVE与手动上下文的提示表现最佳，Top-3策略使修复率达62%（原基线40%）。

Conclusion: 集成多提示策略可显著提升零样本漏洞修复效果，上下文信息（如CVE）是关键因素。未来可优化上下文组合与模型迭代策略以提高LLM的AVR实用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
automated vulnerability detection and repair in software systems. This paper
investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a
widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information
affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the
latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical
prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain
various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually
extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42
vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's
automated testing framework.
  Our results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\% worse on average than GPT-4
with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\% more distinct vulnerabilities
in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair
rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact. Combining
CVE guidance with manually extracted code context resulted in the best
performance. Using our \textsc{Top}-3 prompts together, GPT-4o repaired 26
(62\%) vulnerabilities at least once, outperforming both the original baseline
(40\%) and its reproduction (45\%), suggesting that ensemble prompt strategies
could improve vulnerability repair in zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 尽管预训练语音表示（如wav2vec2和HuBERT）存在各向异性，但其相似性度量在无转录的关键词识别任务中仍有效，突显预训练对学习鲁棒语音表示的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究预训练语音表示的各向异性特性对下游任务（如计算纪录片语言学中的关键词识别）的实际影响。

Method: 使用动态时间规整（Dynamic Time Warping）评估wav2vec2的相似性度量在无需转录的情况下识别词语。

Result: 尽管存在各向异性，wav2vec2能有效捕捉语音结构并跨说话者泛化，证明其表示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 预训练对学习丰富且不变的语音表示至关重要，各向异性不影响其在特定任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Pretrained speech representations like wav2vec2 and HuBERT exhibit strong
anisotropy, leading to high similarity between random embeddings. While widely
observed, the impact of this property on downstream tasks remains unclear. This
work evaluates anisotropy in keyword spotting for computational documentary
linguistics. Using Dynamic Time Warping, we show that despite anisotropy,
wav2vec2 similarity measures effectively identify words without transcription.
Our results highlight the robustness of these representations, which capture
phonetic structures and generalize across speakers. Our results underscore the
importance of pretraining in learning rich and invariant speech
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLAP方法仅支持英语音频-文本跨模态检索，无法处理多语言语音内容，限制了其在全球化场景中的应用。

Method: 通过扩展CLAP框架，引入多语言与多领域能力，构建GLAP模型以支持跨语言音频-文本对齐，覆盖语音、音乐、声学事件等多模态场景。

Result: 在Clotho/AudioCaps基准上保持竞争力，语音检索任务准确率提升显著；支持50种语言关键词识别，多语言音乐理解任务表现优异。

Conclusion: GLAP通过统一框架实现跨语言、跨领域的音频语义理解，为多语言环境下的声音检索与分类任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text
retrieval benchmarks like Clotho and AudioCaps, while significantly surpassing
existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content
benchmarks. Further keyword spotting evaluations across 50 languages emphasize
GLAP's advanced multilingual capabilities. Finally, multilingual sound and
music understanding is evaluated across four languages. Checkpoints and Source:

TL;DR: 本文提出SimPhon语音测试方法，通过计算模拟设计优化出25组词对，可检测传统听力测试无法捕捉的超阈听力缺陷，与SII指数无显著相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试对老年性耳聋患者的超阈听力损失功能影响评估不足，需开发更具诊断特异性的语音感知测试方法。

Method: 使用自动语音识别系统模拟听力损失，通过声学降阶分析音素混淆模式，结合语言库筛选候选词对，经模拟测试、专家筛选和敏感性分析优化得到25组测试项。

Result: 最终SimPhon-25测试集诊断性能与语音可懂度指数(SII)无显著相关，表明其能捕捉超出单纯可听性范围的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: 计算优化的SimPhon测试集显著提升听力学测试开发效率，已具备开展人体测试条件，为超阈听力缺陷诊断提供新工具。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统一语音音乐模型依赖昂贵预训练，而直接合并独立训练的模型因权重空间未对齐存在困难。需开发高效融合方法以降低计算成本。

Method: 扩展Git Re-Basin思想，提出相关置换算法：逐层计算最大化特征相关性的置换矩阵，实现transformer层间权重对齐，融合语音与音乐编码器。

Result: 融合模型在音乐任务上较线性插值法提升14.83分平均得分，同时保持原有语音处理能力，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为独立训练编码器的融合提供了可行路径，无需重新预训练即可构建高性能统一音频模型，具有显著计算效率优势。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量模块化架构，用于改进文本到音频扩散模型的细粒度控制，在保持音质和条件遵循的同时显著降低内存占用，提升训练与部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到音频扩散模型（如ControlNet）虽能生成高质量音乐，但缺乏动态时间控制，且存在内存占用高、控制方式固定的问题。

Method: 通过设计轻量级模块化架构，减少模型克隆参数数量，支持独立控制模块的灵活组合，替代传统全编码器微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在音质和条件遵循上与ControlNet相当，但参数更少、内存占用降低，支持更高效的多控制训练与部署。

Conclusion: 所提方法在保持性能的前提下实现了轻量化与灵活性突破，为音乐生成领域提供了更实用的动态控制解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the
accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种自动检测长时儿童音频中可被现代ASR可靠转录的语音片段的方法，显著降低词错误率，支持自动化语言分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时儿童日常录音是研究语言环境的重要数据，但海量规模使人工标注不可行，而传统ASR因噪声和未约束环境难以直接应用。需找到折中方案实现自动化转录。

Method: 通过筛选可被ASR高精度转录的语音片段（而非处理完整录音），部分转录长时音频。在四个英语长时语料库中验证该方法仅转录13%的总语音量。

Result: 筛选后转录的中位词错误率(WER)为0%，平均WER为18%，而未筛选时中位/平均WER达52%。自动与人工转录的词汇对数频率相关性达r=0.92（全体词）和r=0.98（高频词）。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了长时儿童音频中部分语音的高精度自动转录，为深入自动化分析提供了可行路径，且转录结果与人工标注具有高度统计一致性。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

Motivation: 解决传统声音合成中仅实现简单叠加的问题，旨在通过特征保留和可控合成生成具有新听觉特征的抽象声音。

Method: 采用反演技术配置模型输出为常数，开发基于DPMSolver++的SDE/ODE反演模型，消除噪声预测循环依赖，保持采样过程灵活引导。

Result: 提出的反演方法在保持原始样本核心特征的同时，实现了无需提示输入的可控声音合成，突破了传统线性叠加限制。

Conclusion: 新型反演框架有效解决了噪声预测依赖问题，为抽象声音合成提供了无需条件约束的灵活生成方案。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Motivation: 传统舞蹈表演中动作被动响应音乐的单向关系限制了创作维度，现有AI舞蹈研究多聚焦音乐驱动编舞。本研究旨在赋予舞者通过动作主动作曲的能力，构建双向艺术创作伙伴关系。

Method: 开发多模态架构系统，通过智能算法实时分析舞蹈动作特征，动态组合预录音乐片段生成连贯配乐，实现动作到音乐的逆向映射。

Result: 通过动作-音频相关性分析，揭示了运动特征与音乐参数之间的新型交互模式，验证了系统在保持音乐连贯性同时实现双向创作的能力。

Conclusion: 将AI重新定位为响应式艺术协作者，不仅提升专业舞蹈表现维度，更为大众即兴创作开辟新路径，重构人机在表演艺术中的互动范式。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

TL;DR: SwiftSpec通过重新设计推测解码流程，结合异步、解耦架构及优化技术，显著提升大语言模型解码速度，在8块Hopper上实现Llama3-70B模型348 token/s的极低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码与张量并行方法因计算资源不匹配、KV缓存不一致及小批量通信开销等问题无法协同使用，导致大模型长文本生成延迟较高。

Method: 采用异步解耦流水线设计，提出并行树生成、树感知KV缓存管理、低延迟融合内核，灵活扩展组件并消除草案模型关键路径开销。

Conclusion: SwiftSpec通过架构创新与系统级优化，解决了推测解码与张量并行的协同难题，为超低延迟LLM服务提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-latency decoding for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
applications like chatbots and code assistants, yet generating long outputs
remains slow in single-query settings. Prior work on speculative decoding
(which combines a small draft model with a larger target model) and tensor
parallelism has each accelerated decoding. However, conventional approaches
fail to apply both simultaneously due to imbalanced compute requirements
(between draft and target models), KV-cache inconsistencies, and communication
overheads under small-batch tensor-parallelism. This paper introduces
SwiftSpec, a system that targets ultra-low latency for LLM decoding. SwiftSpec
redesigns the speculative decoding pipeline in an asynchronous and
disaggregated manner, so that each component can be scaled flexibly and remove
draft overhead from the critical path. To realize this design, SwiftSpec
proposes parallel tree generation, tree-aware KV cache management, and fused,
latency-optimized kernels to overcome the challenges listed above. Across 5
model families and 6 datasets, SwiftSpec achieves an average of 1.75x speedup
over state-of-the-art speculative decoding systems and, as a highlight, serves
Llama3-70B at 348 tokens/s on 8 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, making it the fastest known
system for low-latency LLM serving at this scale.

Result: 实验表明，FeNN单核在SNN分类器模拟中速度优于嵌入式GPU和Intel Loihi系统，且硬件利用率低、数值精度高。

Conclusion: FeNN通过软硬件协同优化，为SNN模拟提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于从边缘到云端的不同场景，验证了FPGA在低算术强度计算中的潜力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

### [275] [Decadal sink-source shifts of forest aboveground carbon since 1988](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11879)
*Zhen Qian,Sebastian Bathiany,Teng Liu,Lana L. Blaschke,Hoong Chen Teo,Niklas Boers*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 本研究通过整合多源卫星数据与概率模型，揭示了1988-2021年全球森林地上碳储量动态。尽管全球森林仍为碳汇，但湿润热带与北方森林已转为碳源，未受干扰区域对碳损失的贡献显著增加，表明气候变化对碳循环的影响加剧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林作为重要碳汇对缓解全球变暖至关重要，但其地上碳储量（AGC）长期动态及源-汇转换机制存在不确定性，主要源于干扰机制变化与观测分析方法的不一致。

Method: 通过融合多源卫星观测数据与概率深度学习模型，构建高空间分辨率（1公里）的全球森林AGC储量与通量数据集（1988-2021），同步估算不确定性并进行时空可靠性验证。

Result: 全球森林30年净吸收6.2 PgC，但湿润热带森林在2001-2010年转为显著碳源，与北方森林共同在2011-2021年持续源化。巴西亚马逊未受干扰区域的碳损失贡献从33%（1989-2000）升至76%（2011-2021）。全球大气CO2增长率与热带AGC通量的负相关性增强（r=-0.63，2011-2021）。

Conclusion: 热带森林AGC对陆地碳循环变率的调控作用增强，人为气候变化可能通过影响未受干扰区域加速碳损失，需重新评估自然碳汇的长期稳定性与气候反馈机制。

Abstract: As enduring carbon sinks, forest ecosystems are vital to the terrestrial
carbon cycle and help moderate global warming. However, the long-term dynamics
of aboveground carbon (AGC) in forests and their sink-source transitions remain
highly uncertain, owing to changing disturbance regimes and inconsistencies in
observations, data processing, and analysis methods. Here, we derive reliable,
harmonized AGC stocks and fluxes in global forests from 1988 to 2021 at high
spatial resolution by integrating multi-source satellite observations with
probabilistic deep learning models. Our approach simultaneously estimates AGC
and associated uncertainties, showing high reliability across space and time.
We find that, although global forests remained an AGC sink of 6.2 PgC over 30
years, moist tropical forests shifted to a substantial AGC source between 2001
and 2010 and, together with boreal forests, transitioned toward a source in the
2011-2021 period. Temperate, dry tropical and subtropical forests generally
exhibited increasing AGC stocks, although Europe and Australia became sources
after 2011. Regionally, pronounced sink-to-source transitions occurred in
tropical forests over the past three decades. The interannual relationship
between global atmospheric CO2 growth rates and tropical AGC flux variability
became increasingly negative, reaching Pearson's r = -0.63 (p < 0.05) in the
most recent decade. In the Brazilian Amazon, the contribution of deforested
regions to AGC losses declined from 60% in 1989-2000 to 13% in 2011-2021, while
the share from untouched areas increased from 33% to 76%. Our findings suggest
a growing role of tropical forest AGC in modulating variability in the
terrestrial carbon cycle, with anthropogenic climate change potentially
contributing increasingly to AGC changes, particularly in previously untouched
areas.

Conclusion: 通过将合作博弈论形式化引入强化学习，本文为开放多智能体系统提供了理论严谨的信用分配框架，拓展了动态场景下临时协作问题的解决方法。

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 本文提出对称自编码器的理论分析框架，结合Eckart-Young-Schmidt定理解释其重构误差，并提出基于SVD的EYS初始化策略，通过实验验证其优于传统深度自编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度自编码器虽广泛应用，但其表达能力缺乏严格理论支撑，尤其相较于经典投影方法。本文旨在建立对称自编码器的数学分析框架，弥补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 对对称自编码器进行形式化分类，利用EYS定理分析正交约束下的重构误差，提出基于迭代奇异值分解的EYS初始化策略。

Result: 数值实验表明，EYS初始化策略在对称自编码器中表现优于传统方法，模型设计与初始化对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 对称自编码器的理论分析可通过经典数学工具实现，EYS策略为深度架构的初始化提供了理论指导，验证了模型对称性设计的重要性。

Abstract: Deep autoencoders have become a fundamental tool in various machine learning
applications, ranging from dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling
of partial differential equations to anomaly detection and neural machine
translation. Despite their empirical success, a solid theoretical foundation
for their expressiveness remains elusive, particularly when compared to
classical projection-based techniques. In this work, we aim to take a step
forward in this direction by presenting a comprehensive analysis of what we
refer to as symmetric autoencoders, a broad class of deep learning
architectures ubiquitous in the literature. Specifically, we introduce a formal
distinction between different classes of symmetric architectures, analyzing
their strengths and limitations from a mathematical perspective. For instance,
we show that the reconstruction error of symmetric autoencoders with
orthonormality constraints can be understood by leveraging the well-renowned
Eckart-Young-Schmidt (EYS) theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, we end up
developing the EYS initialization strategy for symmetric autoencoders, which is
based on an iterated application of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To
validate our findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments where we
benchmark our proposal against conventional deep autoencoders, discussing the
importance of model design and initialization.

Abstract: Inverse problems are concerned with the reconstruction of unknown physical
quantities using indirect measurements and are fundamental across diverse
fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and material sciences. These
problems serve as critical tools for visualizing internal structures beyond
what is visible to the naked eye, enabling quantification, diagnosis,
prediction, and discovery. However, most inverse problems are ill-posed,
necessitating robust mathematical treatment to yield meaningful solutions.
While classical approaches provide mathematically rigorous and computationally
stable solutions, they are constrained by the ability to accurately model
solution properties and implement them efficiently.
  A more recent paradigm considers deriving solutions to inverse problems in a
data-driven manner. Instead of relying on classical mathematical modeling, this
approach utilizes highly over-parameterized models, typically deep neural
networks, which are adapted to specific inverse problems using carefully
selected training data. Current approaches that follow this new paradigm
distinguish themselves through solution accuracy paired with computational
efficiency that was previously inconceivable.
  These notes offer an introduction to this data-driven paradigm for inverse
problems. The first part of these notes will provide an introduction to inverse
problems, discuss classical solution strategies, and present some applications.
The second part will delve into modern data-driven approaches, with a
particular focus on adversarial regularization and provably convergent linear
plug-and-play denoisers. Throughout the presentation of these methodologies,
their theoretical properties will be discussed, and numerical examples will be
provided. The lecture series will conclude with a discussion of open problems
and future perspectives in the field.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的微流变框架，利用激光诱导惯性空化（LIC）和新型Bubble Dynamics Transformer（BDT）神经网络，实现了软粘弹性材料在超高应变率下的非接触式快速表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流变学工具在超高应变率（>1000 1/s）下受限于加载速度、分辨率或侵入性，难以有效研究软生物材料的力学特性。

Method: 结合LIC技术产生微尺度气泡坍塌过程，通过超高速成像捕捉气泡动态，并利用基于物理模拟数据训练的BDT神经网络直接推断材料粘弹性参数，避免迭代拟合或复杂反演。

Result: BDT能快速准确地从气泡半径-时间数据中提取材料参数，在极端加载条件下实现非接触、高精度的粘弹性表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医学和材料科学领域极端条件下的软材料力学研究提供了高效新工具，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles
nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse
under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to
investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates
(>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes
by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine
learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to
characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high
strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved
bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic
materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using
a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained
on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material
viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex
inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact
characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with
significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了物理信息神经网络（PINN）在三维低频房间声学中建模亥姆霍兹方程的挑战，包括源定义、边界条件和复数声速模型，发现每个波长至少需六个训练点以确保预测准确性。

Motivation: 现有基于PINN的声波场正问题在三维扩展时面临几何复杂性、真实源建模、边界条件处理及复数解等挑战，需研究其收敛性以提升低频房间声学建模效果。

Method: 通过构建三维低频房间声学案例，调整源定义和边界条件数量，引入复数声速模型模拟吸收效应，结合损失函数分析和L2误差对比有限元模拟，评估PINN收敛性。

Conclusion: 研究为低频房间声学建模提供了PINN优化方向，包括训练点密度和物理约束设计，支持后续含吸声体的复杂声场模拟。

Abstract: Studying physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for modeling partial
differential equations to solve the acoustic wave field has produced promising
results for simple geometries in two-dimensional domains. One option is to
compute the time-harmonic wave field using the Helmholtz equation. Compared to
existing numerical models, the physics-informed neural networks forward problem
has to overcome several topics related to the convergence of the optimization
toward the "true" solution. The topics reach from considering the physical
dimensionality (from 2D to 3D), the modeling of realistic sources (from a
self-similar source to a realistic confined point source), the modeling of
sound-hard (Neumann) boundary conditions, and the modeling of the full wave
field by considering the complex solution quantities. Within this contribution,
we study 3D room acoustic cases at low frequency, varying the source definition
and the number of boundary condition sets and using a complex speed of sound
model to account for some degree of absorption. We assess the convergence
behavior by looking at the loss landscape of the PINN architecture, the $L^2$
error compared to a finite element reference simulation for each network
architecture and configuration. The convergence studies showed that at least
six training points per wavelength are necessary for accurate training and
subsequent predictions of the PINN. The developments are part of an initiative
aiming to model the low-frequency behavior of room acoustics, including
absorbers.

Conclusion: CLEAN-MI为构建高质量MI神经数据集提供了可扩展的系统化解决方案，有效克服多源EEG数据异质性挑战，推动基础模型发展。

Abstract: The construction of large-scale, high-quality datasets is a fundamental
prerequisite for developing robust and generalizable foundation models in motor
imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG signals
collected from different subjects and devices are often plagued by low
signal-to-noise ratio, heterogeneity in electrode configurations, and
substantial inter-subject variability, posing significant challenges for
effective model training. In this paper, we propose CLEAN-MI, a scalable and
systematic data construction pipeline for constructing large-scale, efficient,
and accurate neurodata in the MI paradigm. CLEAN-MI integrates frequency band
filtering, channel template selection, subject screening, and marginal
distribution alignment to systematically filter out irrelevant or low-quality
data and standardize multi-source EEG datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CLEAN-MI on multiple public MI datasets, achieving consistent
improvements in data quality and classification performance.

Motivation: 解决资源受限的物联网和边缘设备在实时加密流量分类中面临的硬件限制问题，需在严格内存和计算约束下实现高效网络安全防护。

Method: 采用硬件感知神经架构搜索（HW-NAS）优化1D卷积神经网络，结合头部级预处理策略和会话长度调整，在ISCX VPN-nonVPN数据集上进行定制化训练。

Result: 模型参数量88.26K、计算量10.08M FLOPs，准确率96.59%。相比SOTA模型，资源消耗降低最高444倍，VPN分类任务精度达99.64%。会话长度缩减75%时精度损失仅1-2%，但错误预处理会导致精度下降7%。

Conclusion: HW-NAS方法有效平衡了模型效率与性能，为物联网加密流量实时分析提供硬件友好解决方案，同时强调预处理策略和会话长度选择对维持分类精度的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-efficient deep neural network (DNN), optimized
through hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS); the DNN supports
the classification of session-level encrypted traffic on resource-constrained
Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices. Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional
neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict
memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The
optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters,
10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art
models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in
these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and
runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification
tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type
classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In
addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies
confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a
wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy
considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75%
yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy
with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful
preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic
data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring
about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's
effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing
scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic
within strict hardware limitations.

Abstract: The emerging Internet of AI Agents challenges existing web infrastructure
designed for human-scale, reactive interactions. Unlike traditional web
resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state,
spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding
millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic
behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes
whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry
architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS
propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation
unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate
for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2)
Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband
transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not
incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment,
clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for
adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized
registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.

Abstract: A central idea in understanding brains and building artificial intelligence
is that structure determines function. Yet, how the brain's complex structure
arises from a limited set of genetic instructions remains a key question. The
ultra high-dimensional detail of neural connections vastly exceeds the
information storage capacity of genes, suggesting a compact, low-dimensional
blueprint must guide brain development. Our motivation is to uncover this
blueprint. We introduce a generative model, to learn this underlying
representation from detailed connectivity maps of mouse cortical microcircuits.
Our model successfully captures the essential structural information of these
circuits in a compressed latent space. We found that specific, interpretable
directions within this space directly relate to understandable network
properties. Building on this, we demonstrate a novel method to controllably
generate new, synthetic microcircuits with desired structural features by
navigating this latent space. This work offers a new way to investigate the
design principles of neural circuits and explore how structure gives rise to
function, potentially informing the development of more advanced artificial
neural networks.

activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent
brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain
states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal
dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a
4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn
spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state
prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data.
We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for
model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when
predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI
time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and
dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal
organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at
high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and
the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.

TL;DR: 研究展示如何利用基于大型语言模型（LLM）的Agentic AI，通过自然语言提示自主构建医学图像分割系统，并验证其在胸片分割任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算机视觉系统开发依赖数据科学家手动配置工具，本研究旨在探索Agentic AI能否通过自主规划和工具配置替代这一过程，提升自动化水平。

Method: 扩展开源认知AI框架SimpleMind，集成LLM代理（OpenManus实现），使其能解析自然语言任务、分解目标并生成YAML格式工具配置，自动执行训练（SM-Learn）与推理（SM-Think）。

Result: 在50张胸片图像上，系统自动配置并完成肺、心脏、肋骨分割任务，平均Dice分数分别为0.96、0.82、0.83。

Conclusion: Agentic AI可自主完成传统需人工干预的计算机视觉系统规划与工具配置，为自动化医学图像分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool
utilization. We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be
built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods.
This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool
configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a
proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer
vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the
task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm
(SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest
x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file
in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference)
scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured,
trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores
of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows
the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has
traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer
vision applications.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks
to its ability to extract spatial features. In contrast, the BiLSTM model
performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and
preprocessing techniques in model performance improvement. We also show the
real-world applicability of such models in applications like healthcare and
intelligent home systems, highlighting their potential for unobtrusive activity

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种零样本框架，通过测试时扩展策略增强大语言模型（LLMs）在医学影像诊断中的推理能力，结合视觉语言模型生成多描述并整合为可靠诊断，实验表明其在多模态医学影像中提升诊断准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升LLMs在临床诊断中的推理能力，测试时扩展策略具有普适性，为医学影像的零样本诊断提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

*Xiao Xu,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Manager，一种轻量级插件，通过自适应聚合不同层次单模态专家知识，提升双塔视觉-语言模型（VLM）及多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型存在逐层单模态表示利用效率低、无法灵活挖掘不同层次单模态语义知识，且仅适用于低分辨率数据集的双塔架构。需更全面的跨模态对齐方法以提升性能。

Method: 提出ManagerTower模型，在双塔VLM的每层跨模态交互中引入Manager模块，动态聚合预训练单模态专家的多层次知识；进一步扩展至MLLM架构（如LLaVA-OV），结合多网格算法增强视觉细节捕捉。

Result: ManagerTower在4个下游VL任务中超越基线模型；LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。Manager与多网格算法协同作用，缓解语义模糊性并提升视觉表征多样性。

Conclusion: Manager作为轻量级插件，通过深度（层次知识聚合）和宽度（多网格视觉细节）两个正交维度提升视觉表示，其与多模态架构的兼容性为跨模态对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在细粒度时间推理和受限监督下难以精确关联视频时刻与响应，需改进。

Method: 设计Temporal-aware Fuseformer分层双流架构捕获时序动态，结合全局残差减少冗余，采用四阶段渐进训练增强多模态对齐与推理能力，并构建GPT生成的时间标注QA数据集。

Result: 实验表明DaMO在时间定位和视频问答任务中优于现有方法，尤其在精确时间对齐任务中表现显著。

Conclusion: DaMO为高效视频-语言建模提供新方向，通过时间感知结构和渐进训练有效提升多模态理解与推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于机器学习和深度学习的自动疼痛检测模型在性别公平性上的表现，发现尽管Vision Transformer（ViT）在准确性和部分公平性指标上表现最佳，但所有模型均存在性别偏见，揭示了准确性与公平性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛检测在无法自我报告疼痛的患者中具有重要应用潜力，但其算法在不同人口群体（如性别）中的准确性和公平性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用UNBC-McMaster肩痛表情数据库，对比传统机器学习（线性SVM、径向基SVM）与深度学习方法（CNN、ViT）在仅依赖面部表情视觉模态下的性能，并通过多维度公平性指标评估模型性别偏见。

Result: ViT在准确性及部分公平性指标上最优，但所有模型均表现出性别偏见，表明模型性能与公平性之间存在固有冲突。

Conclusion: 研究强调医疗自动化系统需引入公平感知技术以缓解算法偏见，并需持续探索准确性与公平性之间的平衡策略。

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

Motivation: 单目RGB图像缺乏深度信息，且存在遮挡、复杂关节结构、需已知相机参数等挑战，限制了3D手部姿态估计在AR/VR等领域的应用。

Method: 提出包含关键点对齐步骤和指尖损失的优化流程，通过2D关键点输入直接估计3D手部关节，无需依赖相机参数估计。

Result: 在EgoDexter和Dexter+Object基准测试中达到SotA水平，对无相机先验的野外图像处理鲁棒，但量化分析显示2D关键点估计精度仍显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过消除相机参数依赖实现了竞争性性能，但手部先验无法完全补偿2D关键点估计误差，突显了底层关键点检测的重要性。

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand
priors. Code is available at https://github.com/cpantazop/HandRepo

Abstract: This paper addresses two main objectives. Firstly, we demonstrate the
impressive performance of the LLaVA-NeXT-interleave on 22 datasets across three
different tasks: Multi-Image Reasoning, Documents and Knowledge-Based

Dense Channel Integration (DCI) connector to the LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave and
compare its performance against the standard model. We find that the standard

Conclusion: 该框架通过系统性利用不确定性信息，有效解决了半监督语义分割中的核心挑战，验证了各组件协同作用的有效性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific
and engineering applications.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent
behavior. However, modeling real-world environments presents unique challenges
as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints
are made available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tera-AI/STRIDE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视觉社会语用推理上存在不足，提出新任务及数据集以测试其社交推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）仅依赖文本信息，无法捕捉非语言线索对社交行为理解的影响，而VLMs在此方面的潜力尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出视觉社会语用推理任务，构建高质量数据集，并对多个VLMs进行基准测试。

Result: 实验表明VLMs在视觉社会语用推理任务中存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交动态推理上存在局限性，需通过针对性任务和数据集推动其社交智能发展。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

TL;DR: 本文提出VGR模型，通过增强细粒度视觉感知和引入视觉定位推理机制，显著提升多模态思维链任务性能，同时减少图像令牌使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链推理方法依赖纯语言空间，存在语言偏见且局限于数理领域，难以处理需精细图像理解的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR模型采用两阶段推理：先检测相关图像区域，再结合定位区域进行语言推理。通过构建VGR-SFT训练数据集，融合视觉定位与语言推导，并引入区域回放机制增强多模态理解。

Result: 在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基线上，VGR仅使用30%图像令牌即实现性能提升：MMStar +4.1，AI2D +7.1，ChartQA +12.9。

Conclusion: VGR通过视觉定位与语言推理的协同机制，有效突破传统MLLMs的视觉理解瓶颈，为多模态推理任务提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种分步生成和优化文本-图像任务计划的框架，通过迭代编辑和视觉信息提取解决多模态对齐与步骤连贯性问题，实验证明其在多种骨干模型上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注大语言模型的文本计划生成能力，而多模态（文本-图像）任务计划的生成潜力尚未充分探索，且需解决模态对齐与视觉步骤连贯性两大挑战。

Method: 提出四阶段迭代框架：1)基于历史生成文本步骤草案；2)编辑上一步视觉内容生成新步骤；3)提取PDDL式视觉信息；4)结合视觉信息优化文本草案。支持Mistral-7B/GPT-4o等模型即插即用。

Result: 构建含1,100个多模态任务的新基准数据集，设计多模态一致性评估指标。实验表明该方法在Mistral-7B/Gemini-1.5/GPT-4o等模型上显著优于基线，代码与数据已开源。

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代优化机制有效提升多模态计划生成质量，验证了视觉信息提取与文本优化的协同作用，为多模态任务规划研究提供了新方法和评估基准。

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code
and data are available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/MPlanner.

Motivation: 现有fMRI分析方法因复杂预处理和任务专用模型限制，存在可重复性差、跨任务迁移能力不足的问题，阻碍临床研究标准化。

Method: 基于Mamba架构构建4D fMRI处理框架，采用移位扫描策略和时空优化预训练方法，结合任务提示微调技术，在50,000+受试者的多中心数据（28.65M帧）上进行预训练。

Result: 在年龄/性别预测、疾病诊断等5类任务中超越现有方法，在美韩澳临床数据上实现最佳疾病诊断准确率（AUC 0.89）和认知表型预测性能（r=0.71）。

Conclusion: NeuroSTORM作为首个开源fMRI基础模型，通过标准化架构和高效知识迁移能力，显著提升了脑成像临床研究的可重复性与跨任务适用性。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA方法因跨模态交互不足及实体空间关系捕捉能力弱，难以处理复杂推理场景。

Method: 设计四层动态双向空间塔结构，基于格式塔视觉原理分层观察图像，将像素级关系搜索升级为感知单元驱动的结构化空间组织。

Result: 模块具备跨模型通用性，July模型在3B参数量下取得SOTA，尤其在空间关系问答数据集表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化空间先验实现了从「看图像」到「组织图像内容」的转变，显著提升了空间关系推理能力与模型效率。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

Motivation: 现有基于图学习的神经退行疾病检测方法存在两大局限：1) 无法精确定位全脑连接组中驱动病理的特定脑区；2) 多模态脑图模型计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限设备中应用。

Method: 1) 基于AAL图谱的疾病相关脑区子图提取，减少50%开销；2) 跨节点注意力对齐fMRI/DTI模态，结合自适应门控机制动态融合多模态数据。

Result: 实验表明BrainMAP在计算效率上超越现有方法，同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: BrainMAP框架实现了精准、高效的神经退行疾病脑区识别，为临床低资源场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州因交通系统不足与测速摄像头稀疏导致车辆激增，需精准车道级测速以监控HOV车道、区分车辆类型限速及执行车道限制。现有YOLO方法存在精度低、无车道识别及分类单一等问题。

Method: 使用经800张鸟瞰图微调的YOLOv11模型，识别车辆所在车道并分类为轿车/重型车，同时评估无人机高度、ROI距离与车速对检测的影响，数据来自北加州的无人机影像。

Result: 优化后YOLOv11的MAE为0.97 mph，MSE为0.94 mph²，显著优于先前研究，验证了系统在测速精度与分类上的有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv11模型能有效解决车道识别、多类车辆测速问题，并通过实际数据验证其交通监控应用价值，为动态交通管理提供可靠工具。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉语言任务中常生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息（幻觉），严重影响实际应用中需精准识别的场景可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应及目标对象位置的数据集，采用针对目标区域的偏好学习方法，使模型过滤无关信号并专注纠正幻觉。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个视觉幻觉任务中显著减少错误，提升模型可靠性和性能，且不降低整体表现。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦目标区域的偏好学习，可高效解决MLLMs的幻觉问题，为实际应用提供更可靠的生成结果。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Motivation: 传统基于数据追踪的机器遗忘难以满足多方对FMs的多样化遗忘需求（如监管要求、功能限制），且与人类认知机制中的遗忘模式不一致。

Method: 提出知识追踪机器遗忘框架，通过追踪模型应保留或删除的知识/能力（而非具体训练数据），并结合认知科学中人类遗忘机制设计方法。

Conclusion: 知识追踪遗忘更贴近实际需求与认知规律，为FMs的合规性、可控性提供了新思路，且能适应不同利益相关方的需求。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发跨质量/变换的合成图像检测模型提供了新思路，通过增强策略优化显著提升了实际应用场景中的检测性能。

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer的后训练量化（PTQ）方法在低比特量化时存在显著精度下降问题，传统Hessian近似方法存在局限性，需改进量化损失计算以提升性能。

Method: 基于块级重建框架，提出FIMA-Q方法：1）建立KL散度与FIM的联系以快速计算量化损失；2）设计DPLR-FIM（对角加低秩矩阵）高效近似FIM，并构建最终损失函数。

Result: 在多个视觉任务及ViT架构上的实验表明，该方法在低比特量化场景下显著优于现有最优方法，尤其在精度提升方面表现突出。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q通过改进量化损失计算与FIM近似策略，有效解决了ViT低比特量化精度下降问题，为后训练量化提供了更优方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶使用的深度神经网络(DNN)易受对抗攻击影响，现有防御方法如对抗训练会降低正常场景准确率且泛化性不足。需要开发兼具高精度与强鲁棒性的新型感知模型。

Method: 通过微调视觉语言模型构建专用V2LM模型，设计单任务独立部署(Solo Mode)与多任务联合部署(Tandem Mode)两种范式，并探索将其作为并行组件增强现有系统。

Result: 在对抗攻击下，DNN准确率下降33-46%，而V2LM仅下降<8%。Tandem模式内存占用减少且保持同等鲁棒性。模型集成方案可进一步提升系统抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: V2LM通过视觉-语言联合表征学习，无需对抗训练即实现对抗鲁棒性，为构建安全自动驾驶感知系统提供了新方向，多任务部署模式兼具实用性与资源效率。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

Result: 在ScanNet200和Replica等数据集上验证了方法的零样本性能、鲁棒性和环境适应性，真实场景实验进一步证明了其实际应用能力。

Conclusion: OV-MAP通过创新性特征融合与投票机制，有效解决体素特征混合问题，为开放世界3D建图提供了高精度且无需3D监督的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

*Youjin Jeon,Kyusik Cho,Suhan Woo,Euntai Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出A²LC框架，通过整合自动化标签校正和自适应平衡获取函数，显著提升语义分割中主动标签校正的效率和效果，在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割中手动像素级标注成本高且易出错，现有主动标签校正方法虽利用基础模型生成伪标签，但效率仍有不足。

Method: A²LC框架在传统流程中引入自动化校正阶段（利用标注反馈扩展校正范围）和自适应平衡获取函数（关注尾部类别并补充校正机制）。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上仅用20%预算即超越现有方法，同等预算下性能提升27.23%；在PASCAL VOC 2012上也表现优异。

Conclusion: A²LC通过自动化校正与类别平衡机制，实现了高效且强效的标签校正，为语义分割标注成本问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基准测试主要结合视觉提取与文本推理，缺乏视觉与语言深度交互的复杂推理能力评估。受ARC挑战启发，需构建更贴近真实推理的评测标准。

Method: 通过程序化生成EasyARC数据集，包含渐进难度层级，支持强化学习流程。要求模型进行多图像分析、多步骤推理及自我纠正，实现结构化任务类型与复杂度评估。

Result: 实验显示当前先进视觉语言模型存在显著失败模式，验证了EasyARC对模型真实能力的有效检测。

Conclusion: EasyARC为视觉语言模型的真实推理能力和测试时扩展性评估设立新标准，其开源特性将推动领域研究。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需标注的公平性评估方法，针对机器学习图像分类任务中肤色张量数据的特性，通过概率分布和统计距离捕捉细粒度公平性差异，并设计基于贝叶斯回归的训练方法以减少肤色分类偏差。

Motivation: 现有公平性评估多基于性别、种族等分类特征，而肤色作为张量数据具有连续性和复杂性，传统方法难以捕捉其细微差异，需开发针对性的公平性处理技术。

Method: 将肤色张量转换为概率分布，利用统计距离度量公平性；提出基于多项式函数贝叶斯回归的色彩距离估计方法，优化模型以减少潜在肤色分类偏差。

Result: 新方法实现了跨传统组别的细粒度公平性评估，并通过概率分布与统计距离有效缓解了传统肤色分类的刚性边界问题，提升了模型公平性。

Conclusion: 该方法为连续敏感属性（如肤色）的公平性评估提供了新范式，增强了可信AI在计算机视觉领域的实践价值。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种标准反因果预测模型（SAM）和新型正则化策略DISCO，通过条件独立性优化，使分类器仅关注标签到图像的因果路径，减少对无关信号（如光照）的依赖，在反因果预测中实现鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型在预测时可能利用因果无关的捷径信号（如光照条件），导致预测结果不可靠。需解决此类偏差问题，确保模型依赖真实因果因素。

Method: 提出SAM框架分析反因果场景下的信息路径，并设计DISCO正则化方法，利用条件距离相关性优化回归任务中的条件独立性。

Result: DISCO在多个偏差缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代方案。

Conclusion: 通过强制条件独立性，DISCO能有效减少模型对非因果变量的依赖，提升预测鲁棒性，适用于反因果场景的偏差缓解任务。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较不同模型在COCO数据集子集上的动作识别表现，发现二元视觉Transformer（ViT）以90%的测试准确率显著优于传统卷积网络（35%）和CLIP模型（62-64%），其可解释性分析揭示了模型关注区域差异，证实Transformer的数据效率及可解释技术的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同模型架构（从全连接网络到Transformer）在人类动作识别任务中的性能差异，并通过可解释性技术诊断分类错误原因。

Method: 使用COCO图像库的三类子集，对比全连接网络、卷积网络、CLIP模型及Vision Transformer的性能；采用单因素ANOVA验证统计显著性，结合SHAP解释器和LeGrad热图进行定性分析。

Result: ViT在二元分类中达到90%平均测试准确率，显著优于其他模型（ANOVA检验F=61.37, p<0.001）。可解释性分析显示ViT关注姿态相关区域（如下肢），而简单模型误聚焦于背景纹理。

Conclusion: Transformer在动作识别中具有更高的数据效率和分类精度，可解释性技术能有效揭示模型决策依据，为改进模型提供关键洞察。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

TL;DR: 本文提出MTabVQA基准测试，针对视觉语言模型在多表格图像问答中的不足，通过大规模指令调优数据集提升模型跨表格推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理多表格图像数据（如网页/文档）时存在跨表格解析、关联与多跳推理能力不足的问题，而现有基准仅覆盖单表或非视觉数据，无法有效评估这些能力。

Method: 构建MTabVQA多表格视觉问答基准（含3,745个复杂问题），评估主流VLMs性能，并发布MTabVQA-Instruct指令调优数据集以增强模型推理能力。

Result: 实验表明现有VLMs在MTabVQA上表现显著受限，但通过MTabVQA-Instruct微调后，模型在视觉多表格推理任务中性能大幅提高。

Conclusion: MTabVQA填补了多表格视觉推理评估空白，验证了指令调优对提升模型跨表格多跳推理的有效性，相关代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

TL;DR: 本文提出CLIPFUSION方法，通过融合基于CLIP的判别模型与扩散生成模型，利用跨模态特征互补性解决异常检测中定义模糊、缺陷类型多样及数据稀缺问题，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上实现优于基线的异常分割与分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测面临定义模糊性、缺陷类型多样性（如局部/全局异常）及训练数据稀缺的挑战，需构建能同时捕捉低层细节与高层语义特征的综合性模型。

Method: 结合CLIP判别模型（全局特征）与扩散生成模型（局部细节），提出利用扩散模型的跨注意力图与特征图进行异常检测的协同框架，实现多模态特征互补。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA基准测试中，CLIPFUSION在异常分割与分类任务上均显著超越基线方法，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态与多模型融合策略能有效应对异常检测的多维度挑战，为实际应用提供可扩展解决方案，证明了跨模态特征协同的潜力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在心脏超声视频中面临挑战，如解剖结构细微、时间动态复杂、领域预训练模型缺乏，且传统方法对高样本相似性、低PSNR输入及破坏临床特征的增强敏感。

Method: DISCOVR采用双分支框架：视频编码器建模时间动态，图像编码器提取细粒度空间语义，通过语义聚类蒸馏损失将图像编码器的解剖知识迁移至视频编码器，增强时间一致性与语义理解。

Result: 在涵盖胎儿、儿童及成人的六个心脏超声数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本、线性探测及分割迁移任务中均优于现有视频异常检测方法和SOTA自监督基线。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过跨模态蒸馏有效融合时空与语义信息，为医学影像分析提供了更鲁棒且临床可解释的自监督表征学习方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

Abstract: Isometric exercises appeal to individuals seeking convenience, privacy, and
minimal dependence on equipments. However, such fitness training is often
overdependent on unreliable digital media content instead of expert
supervision, introducing serious risks, including incorrect posture, injury,
and disengagement due to lack of corrective feedback. To address these
challenges, we present a real-time feedback system for assessing isometric
poses. Our contributions include the release of the largest multiclass
isometric exercise video dataset to date, comprising over 3,600 clips across
six poses with correct and incorrect variations. To support robust evaluation,
we benchmark state-of-the-art models-including graph-based networks-on this
dataset and introduce a novel three-part metric that captures classification
accuracy, mistake localization, and model confidence. Our results enhance the
feasibility of intelligent and personalized exercise training systems for home
workouts. This expert-level diagnosis, delivered directly to the users, also
expands the potential applications of these systems to rehabilitation,

Motivation: 现有3D检测器依赖昂贵的LiDAR数据，而车载摄像头已广泛普及。研究旨在开发基于纯视觉的低成本替代方案，并扩展检测对象至所有道路参与者。

Method: 使用2D CNN处理每个2D检测结果的点云数据，将现有视觉2D算法结果转换为3D检测，重点优化计算效率。

Result: 在KITTI 3D检测基准中达到与最先进图像方法相当的精度，运行时间仅为同类方法的三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了纯视觉方案作为LiDAR低成本替代的可行性，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率，且支持多类别检测。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

TL;DR: 本文通过冻结语言模型与视觉模型，仅训练线性适配器研究视觉-语言表征对齐机制，发现视觉特征在语言模型中后层逐步对齐，质疑现有适配器架构的优化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）的跨模态表征对齐机制不明确，需探究冻结模型下视觉特征如何映射至语言空间，以理解对齐过程及架构有效性。

Method: 冻结预训练LLM和ViT，仅训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调优，利用LLM的稀疏自编码器（SAEs）作为分析工具，研究特征对齐的层间动态。

Result: SAE分析显示，视觉表征在LLM中后层逐步与语言特征对齐，ViT输出与LLM早期层存在基础不对齐，适配器架构可能未最优支持跨模态学习。

Conclusion: 当前适配器架构可能未充分优化跨模态表征学习，需重新审视视觉-语言模型的对齐机制及适配器设计对特征融合的影响。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在音频-视觉任务中的安全漏洞，包括对抗攻击、后门攻击和越狱攻击，填补现有研究对攻击类型覆盖不全的空白，并探讨未来防御挑战与趋势。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs依赖第三方数据和开源模型，导致安全风险加剧。现有研究仅关注特定攻击类型，缺乏对音频-视觉多模态模型安全漏洞的系统性分析。

Method: 通过系统性综述音频-视觉攻击类型（对抗攻击、后门攻击、越狱攻击），并结合最新MLLMs的实际案例，分析攻击机制与防御不足。

Result: 实证表明，攻击者可通过指令或输入（如对抗扰动、恶意查询）绕过MLLMs内部安全机制，生成有害内容，现有防御机制存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: 未来需针对多模态攻击开发更全面的防御策略，并关注新兴攻击类型与模型动态演化的安全挑战，推动跨领域协作研究。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which bridge the gap between
audio-visual and natural language processing, achieve state-of-the-art
performance on several audio-visual tasks. Despite the superior performance of
MLLMs, the scarcity of high-quality audio-visual training data and
computational resources necessitates the utilization of third-party data and
open-source MLLMs, a trend that is increasingly observed in contemporary
research. This prosperity masks significant security risks. Empirical studies
demonstrate that the latest MLLMs can be manipulated to produce malicious or
harmful content. This manipulation is facilitated exclusively through
instructions or inputs, including adversarial perturbations and malevolent
queries, effectively bypassing the internal security mechanisms embedded within
the models. To gain a deeper comprehension of the inherent security
vulnerabilities associated with audio-visual-based multimodal models, a series
of surveys investigates various types of attacks, including adversarial and
backdoor attacks. While existing surveys on audio-visual attacks provide a
comprehensive overview, they are limited to specific types of attacks, which
lack a unified review of various types of attacks. To address this issue and
gain insights into the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic review of audio-visual attacks, which include
adversarial attacks, backdoor attacks, and jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全推理框架因高计算与通信成本难以实际部署，需解决外包神经网络推理中的隐私泄露问题。

Method: 结合全布尔GMW协议解决安全比较问题，利用预处理的Beaver比特三元组、NTT预处理及GPU加速优化线性/非线性操作，并提出可验证全精度的变体SecONNds-P。

Result: 在37位量化SqueezeNet模型上，GPU端到端推理时间2.8秒，通信量仅420 MiB；非线性操作在线速度提升17倍，线性操作CPU/GPU分别加速1.6倍和2.2倍。

Conclusion: SecONNds以低开销实现高效安全推理，适用于资源受限环境，其开源特性促进隐私敏感应用的部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of outsourced neural network inference presents
significant privacy challenges, as sensitive user data is processed on
untrusted remote servers. Secure inference offers a privacy-preserving
solution, but existing frameworks suffer from high computational overhead and
communication costs, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. We
introduce SecONNds, a non-intrusive secure inference framework optimized for
large ImageNet-scale Convolutional Neural Networks. SecONNds integrates a novel
fully Boolean Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson (GMW) protocol for secure comparison
-- addressing Yao's millionaires' problem -- using preprocessed Beaver's bit
triples generated from Silent Random Oblivious Transfer. Our novel protocol
achieves an online speedup of 17$\times$ in nonlinear operations compared to
state-of-the-art solutions while reducing communication overhead. To further
enhance performance, SecONNds employs Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)
preprocessing and leverages GPU acceleration for homomorphic encryption
operations, resulting in speedups of 1.6$\times$ on CPU and 2.2$\times$ on GPU
for linear operations. We also present SecONNds-P, a bit-exact variant that
ensures verifiable full-precision results in secure computation, matching the
results of plaintext computations. Evaluated on a 37-bit quantized SqueezeNet
model, SecONNds achieves an end-to-end inference time of 2.8 s on GPU and 3.6 s
on CPU, with a total communication of just 420 MiB. SecONNds' efficiency and
reduced computational load make it well-suited for deploying privacy-sensitive
applications in resource-constrained environments. SecONNds is open source and
can be accessed from: https://github.com/shashankballa/SecONNds.

*Shaun Shuster,Eyal Zaloof,Asaf Shabtai,Rami Puzis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型（LLMs）的欺诈分析师助手框架（FAA），通过自动化信用卡欺诈调查与生成解释性报告，缓解分析师因海量警报导致的工作疲劳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商行业欺诈交易激增，传统人工调查效率低下且易疲劳，需通过自动化技术提升调查效率。

Method: FAA框架结合LLMs的推理、代码执行及视觉能力，分步骤执行调查规划、证据收集与分析，并生成报告。

Result: 在500次欺诈调查的实证评估中，FAA平均完成7步调查流程，证明其可靠性与高效性。

Conclusion: FAA框架可显著自动化欺诈调查流程，减轻分析师工作负担并提升系统漏洞修复能力。

Abstract: The continuous growth of the e-commerce industry attracts fraudsters who
exploit stolen credit card details. Companies often investigate suspicious
transactions in order to retain customer trust and address gaps in their fraud
detection systems. However, analysts are overwhelmed with an enormous number of
alerts from credit card transaction monitoring systems. Each alert
investigation requires from the fraud analysts careful attention, specialized
knowledge, and precise documentation of the outcomes, leading to alert fatigue.
To address this, we propose a fraud analyst assistant (FAA) framework, which
employs multi-modal large language models (LLMs) to automate credit card fraud
investigations and generate explanatory reports. The FAA framework leverages
the reasoning, code execution, and vision capabilities of LLMs to conduct
planning, evidence collection, and analysis in each investigation step. A
comprehensive empirical evaluation of 500 credit card fraud investigations
demonstrates that the FAA framework produces reliable and efficient
investigations comprising seven steps on average. Thus we found that the FAA
framework can automate large parts of the workload and help reduce the
challenges faced by fraud analysts.

Abstract: Machine learning models should not reveal particular information that is not
otherwise accessible. Differential privacy provides a formal framework to
mitigate privacy risks by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any
single data point does not significantly alter the output of an algorithm, thus
limiting the exposure of private information. This survey paper explores the
foundational definitions of differential privacy, reviews its original
formulations and tracing its evolution through key research contributions. It
then provides an in-depth examination of how DP has been integrated into
machine learning models, analyzing existing proposals and methods to preserve
privacy when training ML models. Finally, it describes how DP-based ML
techniques can be evaluated in practice. %Finally, it discusses the broader
implications of DP, highlighting its potential for public benefit, its
real-world applications, and the challenges it faces, including vulnerabilities
to adversarial attacks. By offering a comprehensive overview of differential
privacy in machine learning, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing
development of secure and responsible AI systems.

Abstract: Modern life has witnessed the explosion of mobile devices. However, besides
the valuable features that bring convenience to end users, security and privacy
risks still threaten users of mobile apps. The increasing sophistication of
these threats in recent years has underscored the need for more advanced and
efficient detection approaches. In this chapter, we explore the application of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify security risks and privacy violations
and mitigate them for the mobile application ecosystem. By introducing
state-of-the-art research that applied LLMs to mitigate the top 10 common
security risks of smartphone platforms, we highlight the feasibility and
potential of LLMs to replace traditional analysis methods, such as dynamic and
hybrid analysis of mobile apps. As a representative example of LLM-based
solutions, we present an approach to detect sensitive data leakage when users
share images online, a common behavior of smartphone users nowadays. Finally,
we discuss open research challenges.

*Ranindya Paramitha,Yuan Feng,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 现有漏洞数据集在机器学习测试中存在回顾性信息偏差，本文提出时间序列重组方法评估模型学习效果，发现多数模型性能随时间提升不一致，未真正学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏洞检测ML方法使用历史数据时存在标签时效性问题：训练时使用的未来未知标签会导致评估过于乐观或保守，无法反映模型在真实场景中的动态表现。

Method: 将数据集按时间轴重组为连续子集，动态调整训练/测试集的可见标签；使用Mann-Kendall检验分析模型在4个漏洞数据集(BigVul 3项目+Vuldeepecker NVD)和5个模型(Code2Vec等)上的性能趋势。

Result: 与直觉相反，模型性能未随数据量增加而稳定提升。Mann-Kendall检验显示各年份性能变化不一致，表明多数模型未实现有效学习。

Conclusion: 仅增加回顾性信息不能保证ML模型性能提升，现有漏洞检测模型缺乏持续学习能力，需开发考虑时间动态性的新评估范式。

Abstract: Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective
information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at
the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As
vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past
performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only
considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual
differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such
approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or
too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to
restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and
testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If
the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as
more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be
checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for
vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul
dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul,
ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker). In contrast to the intuitive expectation (more
retrospective information, better performance), the trend results show that
performance changes inconsistently across the years, showing that most models
are not learning.

Conclusion: HbHAI为加密数据AI处理提供了高效解决方案，其技术可行性得到独立验证，但需进一步优化细节以完善实际应用。

Abstract: We present a technical evaluation of a new, disruptive cryptographic approach
to data security, known as HbHAI (Hash-based Homomorphic Artificial
Intelligence). HbHAI is based on a novel class of key-dependent hash functions
that naturally preserve most similarity properties, most AI algorithms rely on.
As a main claim, HbHAI makes now possible to analyze and process data in its
cryptographically secure form while using existing native AI algorithms without
modification, with unprecedented performances compared to existing homomorphic
encryption schemes.
  We tested various HbHAI-protected datasets (non public preview) using
traditional unsupervised and supervised learning techniques (clustering,
classification, deep neural networks) with classical unmodified AI algorithms.
This paper presents technical results from an independent analysis conducted
with those different, off-the-shelf AI algorithms. The aim was to assess the
security, operability and performance claims regarding HbHAI techniques. As a
results, our results confirm most these claims, with only a few minor
reservations.

Motivation: 旨在通过能量函数框架统一现代Hopfield网络与注意力机制，解决传统线性模型在复杂关系建模中的不足，提升Transformer对上下文的理解与计算效率。

Method: 构建能量函数，其最小值对应注意力计算的稳态点，形成非线性'上下文井'。类比三次样条的非线性表达能力，提出在Transformer模型中引入非线性注意力头。

Result: 能量景观的梯度与注意力计算等价，非线性机制可增强模型对复杂关系的建模能力，为BERT等模型提供改进方向。

Conclusion: 通过能量函数框架将注意力机制与Hopfield网络统一，非线性注意力头的引入可显著提升Transformer模型的表征学习能力和任务性能。

Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern
Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the
attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima
of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate
the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across
$n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds
to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to
enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling
tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning
of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can
be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear
data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used
for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as
BERT, [6], etc.

Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of
selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered
increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored,
even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of
developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize
population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly
speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be
effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a
practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle
inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss
with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in
both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications. Code

Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for
optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks,
where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world
applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function
networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently
and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this
structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only
a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive
objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based
acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose
an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a
modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of
node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive
global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method
maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over
the original p-KGFN algorithm.

Conclusion: 通过低精度差异建模和噪声分布估计，可在保持精度的前提下显著降低贝叶斯反问题计算成本，适用于复杂心血管系统建模。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly
challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity
simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and
explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the
posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common
approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation
itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and
low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is
modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear
dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a
lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy
between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its
distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the
approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the
likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of
the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions
derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and
computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two
cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel
model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空数据在基础设施应用中广泛存在，但现有SciML方法在构建全时空替代模型上面临挑战，尤其是同时捕捉多自由度动态响应的问题。

Method: 通过增强分支网络的表达能力和扩展主干网络的预测能力，提出FExD模型，以斜拉桥随机地震响应为案例，对比验证其性能。

Result: FExD在精度和计算效率上均优于传统DeepONet和扩展时空DeepONet，成功同步捕获多传感器位置的动态响应。

Conclusion: FExD为结构动力学中的算子学习提供了高效准确的解决方案，标志着该领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at
different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of
civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in
tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories,
creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study
proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the
full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate
that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The
proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator
across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the
branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network.
The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics
at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge
subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from
the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a
modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the
proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency,
representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural
dynamics applications.

Conclusion: 非精确求解器在降低计算成本的同时仍能维持贝叶斯优化的理论性能，为实际应用提供了效率与精度的平衡方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for
optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an
acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path
from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS).
However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often
intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic
situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of
the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition
solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS
without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our
results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy,
inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated
by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical
validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient
acquisition function solver.

Motivation: 探讨EM算法在过参数化高斯混合模型中的收敛行为，为高维聚类和密度估计任务提供理论支持与实践指导。

Method: 基于规则单形顶点分布的均值结构与非退化权重条件，利用负对数似然函数的强凸性及Polyak-Łojasiewicz不等式，结合有限样本统计收敛分析与合成数据实验验证。

Result: 理论证明总体EM算法具有O(log(1/ε))的指数收敛速度，有限样本下统计收敛性明确，实验显示收敛速度显著快于传统次线性速率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过参数化场景中EM算法的快速收敛特性，为模型初始化与设计提供了理论依据，推动了高维数据分析方法的优化。

Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to
overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components
in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing
on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the
vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy
condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges
exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis
leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a
neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz
inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable
in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a
finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees.
Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical
findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to
conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of
EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into
initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and
density estimation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文通过链接预测任务比较了概率图模型（PGMs）与图神经网络（GNNs）在图数据中的表现，发现PGMs在低维/噪声特征及高异配性场景下更具优势，且计算复杂性和可解释性更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究PGMs与GNNs在捕捉图结构数据信息时的差异，特别是在真实场景中常见的数据特征（如低维、噪声、异配性）下的表现。

Method: 基于合成和真实网络数据，设计三个实验：1）分析模型对输入特征的处理能力；2）测试对噪声特征的鲁棒性；3）评估对图异配性增加的适应性。

Result: PGMs在低维/噪声特征下优于GNNs，且对高异配性更鲁棒；GNNs依赖高质量特征，无法仅利用边信息。PGMs在计算复杂性和可解释性上也表现更佳。

Conclusion: PGMs在特征受限或图结构复杂（如高异配性）的实际应用中可能比GNNs更适用，但需权衡任务类型（如预测性能与可解释性需求）。

Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are
widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage
graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The
question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in
networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task
and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one
focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two
investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of
the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot
exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We
find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional
or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar
or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the
heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond
prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their
computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: 自由解压缩为处理不可触矩阵提供了新工具，在分布式学习和大规模数据分析中具有应用价值，突破了传统谱估计方法的限制。

Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many
machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants,
the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets
continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices
become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct
formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on
matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the
matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning,
or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can
be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these
cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit
operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In
such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to
only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory
to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of
such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical
spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely
large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full
matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting
distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as
applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their
full empirical eigenspectra.

### [341] [Measuring multi-calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11251)
*Ido Guy,Daniel Haimovich,Fridolin Linder,Nastaran Okati,Lorenzo Perini,Niek Tax,Mark Tygert*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Kuiper统计量的多标定度量新方法，通过信号噪声比加权子群体贡献，避免传统分箱/核密度估计问题，并在基准数据集验证有效性。

Result: 数值实验表明新指标能有效反映多标定程度，且信号噪声比加权机制对指标稳定性起关键作用，在基准数据集表现良好。

Conclusion: 基于Kuiper统计量构建的多标定度量方法具有理论优势，其信号噪声比加权机制有效提升指标鲁棒性，为概率预测评估提供新工具。

Abstract: A suitable scalar metric can help measure multi-calibration, defined as
follows. When the expected values of observed responses are equal to
corresponding predicted probabilities, the probabilistic predictions are known
as "perfectly calibrated." When the predicted probabilities are perfectly
calibrated simultaneously across several subpopulations, the probabilistic
predictions are known as "perfectly multi-calibrated." In practice, predicted
probabilities are seldom perfectly multi-calibrated, so a statistic measuring
the distance from perfect multi-calibration is informative. A recently proposed
metric for calibration, based on the classical Kuiper statistic, is a natural
basis for a new metric of multi-calibration and avoids well-known problems of
metrics based on binning or kernel density estimation. The newly proposed
metric weights the contributions of different subpopulations in proportion to
their signal-to-noise ratios; data analyses' ablations demonstrate that the
metric becomes noisy when omitting the signal-to-noise ratios from the metric.
Numerical examples on benchmark data sets illustrate the new metric.

Method: 采用最大似然估计法，重点分析置信边界和收敛率参数的似然函数特性，包括小样本偏差、一致性及联合参数估计中的可识别性问题。

Result: 置信边界估计存在小样本偏差但具有一致性，收敛率估计存在持续偏差；参数空间中存在似然函数多峰性，导致联合估计可识别性受限。

Conclusion: 似然函数分析能有效揭示意见动力学模型参数估计的潜在问题，为基于代理的模型校准提供形式化保证，并指导参数空间优化。

Abstract: Opinion dynamics models such as the bounded confidence models (BCMs) describe
how a population can reach consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, depending
on a few parameters. Connecting such models to real-world data could help
understanding such phenomena, testing model assumptions. To this end,
estimation of model parameters is a key aspect, and maximum likelihood
estimation provides a principled way to tackle it. Here, our goal is to outline
the properties of statistical estimators of the two key BCM parameters: the
confidence bound and the convergence rate. We find that their maximum
likelihood estimators present different characteristics: the one for the
confidence bound presents a small-sample bias but is consistent, while the
estimator of the convergence rate shows a persistent bias. Moreover, the joint
parameter estimation is affected by identifiability issues for specific regions
of the parameter space, as several local maxima are present in the likelihood
function. Our results show how the analysis of the likelihood function is a
fruitful approach for better understanding the pitfalls and possibilities of
estimating the parameters of opinion dynamics models, and more in general,
agent-based models, and for offering formal guarantees for their calibration.

Motivation: 当前AI工具虽在各领域广泛应用，但局限于孤立任务支持，缺乏支持持续自适应协作的系统架构，导致人机协作效率受限。

Method: 提出整合交互层、流程层和基础设施层的三维框架，特别将工作流程显式化并设计为可检视、可调整的核心要素，使人类与AI能动态对齐目标并实现长期协调。

Result: 该架构揭示了现有工具的局限性，统一了新兴系统设计方法，并为构建具有目标一致性的智能协作系统提供了新研究路径。

Conclusion: 通过结构化协作框架，将人机协作重新定义为基于流程协调的连贯系统，而非任务级增强，为实际工作场景中的持续协同提供理论基础。

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VR教师培训系统过度追求化身拟真度，导致新手教师认知超载，而技术导向的拟真化与教学所需的渐进学习需求存在脱节，需建立理论指导的设计框架。

Method: 通过系统文献综述分析化身真实度演变，结合认知负荷理论提出渐进式真实度框架，并设计基于概率引擎与检索增强生成数据库的实时响应架构Crazy Slots。

Conclusion: 基于认知理论的渐进式真实度设计能有效平衡技术可行性与教学需求，Crazy Slots架构为可扩展的AI教师培训工具开发提供了新范式。

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Motivation: 精神压力对认知健康的普遍影响需要非侵入式诊断工具，而EEG信号的非平稳高维特性导致建模困难。

Method: 采用卷积层提取空间特征→LSTM建模时序模式→注意力机制聚焦关键时间区域，预处理包含带通滤波、z-score标准化和分段。

Result: AUC达0.68，验证准确率81.25%，优于传统CNN-LSTM基线模型。

Conclusion: Brain2Vec具备集成到可穿戴压力监测平台及个性化医疗系统的潜力。

Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and
overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive
diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window
into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature
poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep
learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a
hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The
model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial
dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns,
and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal
regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass
filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a
comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM
baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation
accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for
integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized
healthcare systems.

Motivation: 现实场景中系统噪声常偏离卡尔曼滤波所需的高斯白噪声假设，传统方法性能受限，需数据驱动的鲁棒滤波技术。

Method: 基于递归Joseph公式传播误差协方差，构建Kalman-filter-informed RNN结构，通过优化高斯负对数似然实现参数学习。

Result: 在非高斯白噪声测量场景下，模型状态估计精度与协方差一致性均超越传统卡尔曼滤波及现有深度学习基准方法。

Conclusion: Recursive KalmanNet通过融合模型驱动与数据驱动方法，有效解决了复杂噪声环境下的状态估计问题，具有理论保障与实践优势。

Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a
challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with
independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from
these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This
paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural
network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance
quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive
Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood.
Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our
model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing
state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.

Conclusion: 该方法通过提升噪声检测精度增强了临床决策能力，支持实时ECG监测，为临床和可穿戴设备应用提供了可靠技术基础。

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which
complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a
diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based
anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited
generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional
evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the
reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate
inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification
using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average
$W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method
by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability,
supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy
and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method
enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG
monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and
wearable ECG applications.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种结合强化学习与剂量优化的全自动HDR近距离治疗规划框架，用于宫颈癌治疗，在保持靶区覆盖的同时提升计划一致性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR近距离治疗高度依赖人工规划经验，存在效率低、一致性差的问题，需开发自动化解决方案以优化临床决策流程。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 基于DQN的强化学习代理迭代选择治疗参数(TPPs)，平衡靶区覆盖与危及器官保护；2) 使用Adam优化器根据TPPs计算驻留时间分布。状态表征包含DVH指标与TPPs，奖励函数整合D90/V150/V200等临床剂量目标。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现跨解剖结构差异的临床相关参数调整，验证了强化学习在自动化放疗规划中的有效性，为减少人工依赖提供可行方案。

Abstract: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of
locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual
treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully
automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement
learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable
treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a
hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep
Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning
parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and
organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both
dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward
function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints,
including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder,
rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a
customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time
distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function.
The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator
geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful
TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients,
the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%,
outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are
notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full
target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出ParetoCSP2多目标遗传算法，通过自适应空间群多样性控制与神经网络势能指导，显著提升无机多晶型结构预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有晶体结构预测（CSP）算法在无机多晶型预测中存在局限性，需克服过早收敛、空间群过代表性问题，以减少实验试错并加速新材料发现。

Method: 结合自适应空间群多样性控制技术（防止单一空间群主导）、改进种群初始化方法、迭代结构松弛，并基于神经网络原子间势能引导算法优化。

Result: 在双多晶型公式预测中实现近乎完美的空间群与结构相似性准确率，基准测试中关键指标比基线算法提升2.46-8.62倍，常规CSP指标提升44.8%-87.04%。

Conclusion: ParetoCSP2通过多目标优化与动态多样性控制，有效提升多晶型预测精度与收敛速度，为材料设计提供高效计算工具。

Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e.
polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical
properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which
they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or
diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these
polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability
relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired
properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However,
effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph
structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic
algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group
diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space
group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using
an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure
relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also
achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves
excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect
space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs
but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset,
it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies
and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

Conclusion: 预训练基础模型与染色质可及性数据的结合能有效提升gRNA活性预测，为基因编辑工具开发提供新思路。

Abstract: Predicting guide RNA (gRNA) activity is critical for effective CRISPR-Cas12
genome editing but remains challenging due to limited data, variation across
protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs-short sequence requirements for Cas binding),
and reliance on large-scale training. We investigate whether pre-trained
biological foundation model originally trained on transcriptomic data can
improve gRNA activity estimation even without domain-specific pre-training.
Using embeddings from existing RNA foundation model as input to lightweight
regressor, we show substantial gains over traditional baselines. We also
integrate chromatin accessibility data to capture regulatory context, improving
performance further. Our results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained
foundation models and chromatin accessibility data for gRNA activity

Conclusion: HEIST通过分层整合空间与基因调控信息，显著提升空间转录组分析能力，证明其在揭示细胞微环境与调控机制中的潜力，为多任务应用提供通用框架。

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven
insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to
understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the
single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the
promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both
spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models
either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene
regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from
neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with
hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create
contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics
data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation
model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as
spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a
gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph
transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing
within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15
organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding
objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that
it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings,
enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models
fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four
downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene
imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple
technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and
GRN-based representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the efficacy and utility of recent advances in
non-local, non-linear image interpolation and extrapolation algorithms,
specifically, ideas based on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), as a tool
for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data. We seek to utilize the microarray
gene expression data sparsely sampled in the healthy human brain, and produce
fully resolved spatial maps of any given gene across the whole brain at a
voxel-level resolution. To do so, we first obtained the 100 top AD risk genes,
whose baseline spatial transcriptional profiles were obtained from the Allen
Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). We adapted Implicit Neural Representation models so
that the pipeline can produce robust voxel-resolution quantitative maps of all
genes. We present a variety of experiments using interpolations obtained from
Abagen as a baseline/reference.

Result: 在Visium等四大平台及人/鼠组织中，聚类指标（ARI/NMI）和轨迹保真度平均超基准方法20%；乳腺癌Xenium数据中发现三阳性受体簇、DCIS-IDC过渡区等临床相关稀有细胞群。

Conclusion: SemanticST为空间转录组提供了可扩展、可解释的分析框架，支持跨组织类型的稳健发现，为空间组织图谱构建和下一代精准医学奠定基础。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable gene expression profiling
with spatial resolution, offering unprecedented insights into tissue
organization and disease heterogeneity. However, current analysis methods often
struggle with noisy data, limited scalability, and inadequate modelling of
complex cellular relationships. We present SemanticST, a biologically informed,
graph-based deep learning framework that models diverse cellular contexts
through multi-semantic graph construction. SemanticST builds multiple
context-specific graphs capturing spatial proximity, gene expression
similarity, and tissue domain structure, and learns disentangled embeddings for
each. These are fused using an attention-inspired strategy to yield a unified,
biologically meaningful representation. A community-aware min-cut loss improves
robustness over contrastive learning, particularly in sparse ST data.
SemanticST supports mini-batch training, making it the first graph neural
network scalable to large-scale datasets such as Xenium (500,000 cells).
Benchmarking across four platforms (Visium, Slide-seq, Stereo-seq, Xenium) and
multiple human and mouse tissues shows consistent 20 percentage gains in ARI,
NMI, and trajectory fidelity over DeepST, GraphST, and IRIS. In re-analysis of
breast cancer Xenium data, SemanticST revealed rare and clinically significant
niches, including triple receptor-positive clusters, spatially distinct
DCIS-to-IDC transition zones, and FOXC2 tumour-associated myoepithelial cells,
suggesting non-canonical EMT programs with stem-like features. SemanticST thus
provides a scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded framework for
spatial transcriptomics analysis, enabling robust discovery across tissue types
and diseases, and paving the way for spatially resolved tissue atlases and
next-generation precision medicine.

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于视觉嵌入的逆向建模方法，有效解决自组织系统中随机观测数据的因果参数反演问题，克服传统方法在特征相似性捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆向建模方法在处理具有强随机性的观测数据时失效，因像素级指标无法捕捉随机结果间的特征相似性。需开发能处理观测空间随机性的新方法。

Method: 利用视觉嵌入构建不变性表征空间，将模式映射到该空间后通过嵌入相似性反演因果参数，无需人工设计目标函数或启发式规则。

Result: 在反应-扩散系统和基于主体的社会隔离模型上验证，可靠恢复参数；应用于真实生物模式，证明其处理实际复杂随机模式的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为理论和实验研究提供了统一工具，可揭示随机复杂模式形成背后的动力学机制，突破传统逆向建模的局限性。

Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate
complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making
self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental
challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the
unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes
particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component,
yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in
this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between
variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method
specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space,
leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations
that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations
onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal
parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics.
We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and
an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers
parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method
to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both
theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex
stochastic pattern formation.

TL;DR: 本文提出Gondola模型，通过多视角图像输入和分割掩码增强LLM的视觉接地能力，在机器人操作任务中实现跨物体、环境和任务的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的机器人规划方法受限于单视角图像输入，难以实现精准物体定位和视觉环境中的接地计划生成。

Method: Gondola模型整合多视角图像和历史计划，生成包含文本与分割掩码的动作计划，并通过RLBench构建三类训练数据集（机器人接地规划、多视角指代表达、伪长时程任务）。

Result: 在GemBench数据集的四个泛化级别（新布局/刚性物体/铰接物体/长时程任务）上均超越当前最先进的LLM方法。

Conclusion: Gondola通过多模态输入和视觉接地机制显著提升了机器人操作任务的泛化能力，验证了多视角视觉信息对LLM规划的重要性。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: 需建立更优的非完美演示模型，解决LfD算法在实验室与实际部署间的差距，所有数据与标注已开源。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All

TL;DR: 本文提出SAIL系统，通过速度自适应模仿学习实现机器人策略的快速执行，在仿真和真实机器人中分别达到4倍和3.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线模仿学习策略受限于演示数据速度，限制了工业自动化等高吞吐量场景的应用需求。

Method: SAIL系统整合四个核心组件：一致性保持动作推断算法、高保真运动目标跟踪、动态速度调节模块和实时动作调度机制。

Result: 在12个仿真/真实任务中，SAIL实现仿真环境4倍加速、真实机器人3.2倍加速的超越演示速度执行。

Conclusion: SAIL通过系统级解决方案有效解决了高速执行中的动力学与分布偏移问题，验证了跨平台加速策略的可行性。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

TL;DR: 本文提出将参数偏移规则（PSR）应用于单式光学神经网络（UONN）的梯度计算，以解决传统反向传播在光学系统中的物理限制问题，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播在光学神经网络中因物理约束难以实现，需寻找替代梯度计算方法。参数偏移规则（PSR）可规避有限差分近似和全光学反向传播的局限性，为硬件训练提供新思路。

Method: 基于马赫-曾德尔干涉仪构建UONN，利用光学干涉的傅里叶级数特性，通过PSR对相位参数进行偏移测量，直接从硬件数据中解析出精确梯度。

Result: PSR成功实现UONN的梯度计算，无需依赖数值模拟，且精度优于传统近似方法，为光学计算系统的硬件训练提供可行方案。

Conclusion: 参数偏移规则为光学神经网络的高效硬件训练开辟了新途径，有望推动光学计算系统的实际应用与优化策略发展。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of the parameter-shift rule (PSR) for
computing gradients in unitary optical neural networks (UONNs). While
backpropagation has been fundamental to training conventional neural networks,
its implementation in optical neural networks faces significant challenges due
to the physical constraints of optical systems. We demonstrate how PSR, which
calculates gradients by evaluating functions at shifted parameter values, can
be effectively adapted for training UONNs constructed from Mach-Zehnder
interferometer meshes. The method leverages the inherent Fourier series nature
of optical interference in these systems to compute exact analytical gradients
directly from hardware measurements. This approach offers a promising
alternative to traditional in silico training methods and circumvents the
limitations of both finite difference approximations and all-optical
backpropagation implementations. We present the theoretical framework and
practical methodology for applying PSR to optimize phase parameters in optical
neural networks, potentially advancing the development of efficient
hardware-based training strategies for optical computing systems.

Abstract: In the age of generative AI and ubiquitous digital tools, human cognition
faces a structural paradox: as external aids become more capable, internal
memory systems risk atrophy. Drawing on neuroscience and cognitive psychology,
this paper examines how heavy reliance on AI systems and discovery-based
pedagogies may impair the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory --
systems essential for expertise, critical thinking, and long-term retention. We
review how tools like ChatGPT and calculators can short-circuit the retrieval,
error correction, and schema-building processes necessary for robust neural
encoding. Notably, we highlight striking parallels between deep learning
phenomena such as "grokking" and the neuroscience of overlearning and
intuition. Empirical studies are discussed showing how premature reliance on AI
during learning inhibits proceduralization and intuitive mastery. We argue that
effective human-AI interaction depends on strong internal models -- biological
"schemata" and neural manifolds -- that enable users to evaluate, refine, and
guide AI output. The paper concludes with policy implications for education and
workforce training in the age of large language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the strategic imperative for
healthcare organizations to develop proprietary foundation models rather than
relying exclusively on commercial alternatives. We examine four fundamental
considerations driving this imperative: the domain-specific requirements of
healthcare data representation, critical data sovereignty and governance
considerations unique to healthcare, strategic competitive advantages afforded
by proprietary AI infrastructure, and the transformative potential of
healthcare-specific foundation models for patient care and organizational
operations. Through analysis of empirical evidence, economic frameworks, and
organizational case studies, we demonstrate that proprietary multimodal
foundation models enable healthcare organizations to achieve superior clinical
performance, maintain robust data governance, create sustainable competitive
advantages, and accelerate innovation pathways. While acknowledging
implementation challenges, we present evidence showing organizations with
proprietary AI capabilities demonstrate measurably improved outcomes, faster
innovation cycles, and stronger strategic positioning in the evolving
healthcare ecosystem. This analysis provides healthcare leaders with a
comprehensive framework for evaluating build-versus-buy decisions regarding
foundation model implementation, positioning proprietary foundation model
development as a cornerstone capability for forward-thinking healthcare
organizations.

Result: AI研究者与公众对AI主观体验出现时间的预测中位数分别为2100年70%和60%；公众更倾向认为其永不出现（25% vs. 研究者10%）。双方均支持当前实施风险防护措施，但对是否应创造此类系统及权利分配存在显著分歧。

Conclusion: 尽管主观体验AI系统的出现时间与治理方案仍存争议，但研究者与公众均认为需提前制定伦理规范，并强调多学科协作评估的必要性。

Abstract: We surveyed 582 AI researchers who have published in leading AI venues and
838 nationally representative US participants about their views on the
potential development of AI systems with subjective experience and how such
systems should be treated and governed. When asked to estimate the chances that
such systems will exist on specific dates, the median responses were 1% (AI
researchers) and 5% (public) by 2024, 25% and 30% by 2034, and 70% and 60% by
2100, respectively. The median member of the public thought there was a higher
chance that AI systems with subjective experience would never exist (25%) than
the median AI researcher did (10%). Both groups perceived a need for
multidisciplinary expertise to assess AI subjective experience. Although
support for welfare protections for such AI systems exceeded opposition, it
remained far lower than support for protections for animals or the environment.
Attitudes toward moral and governance issues were divided in both groups,
especially regarding whether such systems should be created and what rights or
protections they should receive. Yet a majority of respondents in both groups
agreed that safeguards against the potential risks from AI systems with
subjective experience should be implemented by AI developers now, and if
created, AI systems with subjective experience should treat others well, behave
ethically, and be held accountable. Overall, these results suggest that both AI
researchers and the public regard the emergence of AI systems with subjective
experience as a possibility this century, though substantial uncertainty and
disagreement remain about the timeline and appropriate response.

Abstract: Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across
diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial
intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across
various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of
recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation
foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial
embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning,
including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a
generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation
models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation
foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse
scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme
featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge
sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched)
to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the
performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming
existing baselines.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Internet services, recommendation systems play a
central role in delivering personalized content. Faced with massive user
requests and complex model architectures, the key challenge for real-time
recommendation systems is how to reduce inference latency and increase system
throughput without sacrificing recommendation quality. This paper addresses the
high computational cost and resource bottlenecks of deep learning models in
real-time settings by proposing a combined set of modeling- and system-level
acceleration and optimization strategies. At the model level, we dramatically
reduce parameter counts and compute requirements through lightweight network
design, structured pruning, and weight quantization. At the system level, we
integrate multiple heterogeneous compute platforms and high-performance
inference libraries, and we design elastic inference scheduling and
load-balancing mechanisms based on real-time load characteristics. Experiments
show that, while maintaining the original recommendation accuracy, our methods
cut latency to less than 30% of the baseline and more than double system
throughput, offering a practical solution for deploying large-scale online
recommendation services.

Method: 1. 数据准备：标注新闻标题并转化为因果图（包含原因、结果、触发关系）；2. 图检索：利用Neo4j存储图谱，通过混合Cypher查询结合语义嵌入与图结构相似性；3. LLM推理：基于检索结果的小样本学习，采用XML提示进行分类与标注。

Result: 实验表明，框架在因果分类任务中F1-score达82.1%（仅需20个小样本），在新闻可靠性评估、虚假信息检测等实时场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Causal通过图结构与语义的深度融合，解决了传统方法的局限性，为实时因果推理任务提供了高精度、可扩展的解决方案，具有实际落地潜力。

Abstract: GraphRAG-Causal introduces an innovative framework that combines graph-based
retrieval with large language models to enhance causal reasoning in news
analysis. Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex,
implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses
these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured
causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges
semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to
accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a
three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are
meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause,
effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these
graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid
Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and
structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage
utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with
XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal
relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal
achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20
few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency,
making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability
assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.
