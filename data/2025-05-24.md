### [1] [BR-TaxQA-R: A Dataset for Question Answering with References for Brazilian Personal Income Tax Law, including case law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15916)
*Juvenal Domingos Júnior,Augusto Faria,E. Seiti de Oliveira,Erick de Brito,Matheus Teotonio,Andre Assumpção,Diedre Carmo,Roberto Lotufo,Jayr Pereira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BR-TaxQA-R数据集，用于巴西个人所得税法的问答任务，并比较了自定义RAG流程与商业工具的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持巴西个人所得税法领域的问答任务，创建了一个包含官方问答和法规的数据集，并评估AI生成答案的法律有效性。

Method: 使用OpenAI嵌入搜索和GPT-4o-mini生成答案的RAG流程，比较不同文本分割策略，并通过RAGAS指标进行基准测试。

Result: 自定义RAG流程在响应相关性上优于商业系统，但商业模型在事实准确性和流畅性上得分更高。

Conclusion: 在法律高风险领域，AI生成答案的法律有效性仍需专家评估，BR-TaxQA-R数据集已公开。

Abstract: This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question
answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law.
The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document
published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms
and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais
(CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using
OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We
compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against
commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics.
Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in
Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while
commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency.
These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and
linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains
essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes
domains such as taxation. BR-TaxQA-R is publicly available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/unicamp-dl/BR-TaxQA-R.

### [2] [Extracting Probabilistic Knowledge from Large Language Models for Bayesian Network Parameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15918)
*Aliakbar Nafar,Kristen Brent Venable,Zijun Cui,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）中的概率知识来估计现实世界事件的概率，并将其应用于贝叶斯网络（BN）的参数化，结合少量真实数据自动构建BN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已显示出作为事实知识库的潜力，但其生成关于现实世界事件的概率知识的能力尚未充分研究。论文旨在探索如何利用LLMs中的概率知识来参数化BN，以支持特定领域的概率建模。

Method: 论文通过在80个公开可用的BN（涵盖医疗和金融等领域）上进行实验，比较了LLMs生成的条件概率与随机、均匀分布及基于下一个token生成概率的方法。同时，研究了如何利用LLMs生成的分布作为专家先验，结合少量数据优化分布以减少系统偏差。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs在生成条件概率方面提供了有意义的结果，优于基线方法。LLMs生成的分布可作为专家先验，显著减少系统偏差。论文还评估了多种提示策略，并建立了首个评估LLMs提取概率知识性能的综合基线。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种有前景的策略，通过结合LLMs提取的概率知识与少量真实数据，自动构建BN。这不仅扩展了LLMs的应用范围，也为概率建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge
bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about
real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using
probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for
statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a
Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the
parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific
domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from
healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional
probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines,
including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on
next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived
distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from
minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work
introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian
Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small
amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting
strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the
first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting
probabilistic knowledge.

### [3] [Aligning Dialogue Agents with Global Feedback via Large Language Model Reward Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15922)
*Dong Won Lee,Hae Won Park,Cynthia Breazeal,Louis-Philippe Morency*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的奖励分解框架，通过会话级反馈信号对齐对话代理，无需人工设计奖励或细粒度反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工设计奖励或细粒度反馈，成本高且难以扩展。本文旨在利用大语言模型的推理能力，从全局反馈中自动分解细粒度奖励。

Method: 提出两种奖励分解变体：纯文本版本（仅使用对话文本）和多模态版本（结合语音、视线等行为线索）。通过蒸馏轻量级奖励模型，用于强化学习微调对话生成。

Result: 实验表明，两种变体均优于现有奖励分解方法，在对话质量的人类评估中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是强大的奖励分解器，能够替代人工奖励设计和细粒度反馈，提升对话代理的对齐效果。

Abstract: We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for
aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We
leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language
model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global,
session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform
reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal
variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and
facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred
turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we
utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both
text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition
methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of
conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that
obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

### [4] [Citation Parsing and Analysis with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15948)
*Parth Sarin,Juan Pablo Alperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用开源语言模型改进全球引文网络追踪的工具，以解决知识生产与传播中的不平等问题，并测试了多个模型在引文标注任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球知识生产与传播中存在不平等现象，缺乏有效的工具追踪知识共享网络，尤其是在全球南方地区。这种缺失导致南方学者在索引服务中被边缘化，延续了殖民主义的知识结构。

Method: 研究通过构建包含纯文本和标注引文的数据集，评估了多个开源语言模型在引文标注任务上的性能，特别关注了小型模型的表现。

Result: 研究发现，现有语言模型在引文标注任务上表现出高准确率，甚至优于现有最优方法。小型模型Qwen3-0.6B在少量训练后也能高效完成标注任务。

Conclusion: 该工具能显著提升引文网络的准确性，改善研究索引和发现，并推动元科学研究，有助于减少全球知识传播中的不平等。

Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge
production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in
understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted
in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the
Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and
scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements
that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation
network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight
language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We
assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints
and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight
language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box,
today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the
constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all
fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is
likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such
a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus
meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further
metascientific research.

### [5] [Training Step-Level Reasoning Verifiers with Formal Verification Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15960)
*Ryo Kamoi,Yusen Zhang,Nan Zhang,Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FoVer提出了一种自动标注步骤级错误的方法，通过形式化验证工具训练过程奖励模型（PRMs），无需人工标注，并在多种推理任务中展现出跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前过程奖励模型（PRMs）面临两个主要问题：获取准确的步骤级错误标注需要高昂的人工成本，且现有PRMs仅限于数学推理任务。本文旨在解决自动数据集创建和PRMs泛化到多样化推理任务的挑战。

Method: 使用形式化验证工具（如Z3和Isabelle）自动标注步骤级错误，合成训练数据集，训练基于LLM的PRMs，无需人工干预。

Result: FoVer训练的PRMs在ProcessBench的步骤级验证和12个推理基准测试（如MATH、AIME等）中显著优于基线PRMs，并与人工标注或更强模型训练的先进PRMs竞争或超越。

Conclusion: FoVer通过形式化验证工具自动标注数据，成功训练出具有跨任务泛化能力的PRMs，为推理任务的自动验证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the
reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing
attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate
step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human
annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In
response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic
dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To
achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on
step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools,
such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide
automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we
synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal
logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data
synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we
observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task
generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks.
Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs
based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared
to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger
models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K
performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU,
and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at
https://github.com/psunlpgroup/FoVer.

### [6] [Pre-training Large Memory Language Models with Internal and External Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15962)
*Linxi Zhao,Sofian Zalouk,Christian K. Belardi,Justin Lovelace,Jin Peng Zhou,Kilian Q. Weinberger,Yoav Artzi,Jennifer J. Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新型语言模型LMLM，将知识存储于外部数据库而非仅依赖模型权重，实现可编辑、可验证的知识管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经语言模型将知识和语言模式混编在数十亿不透明参数中，导致事实难以可靠检查、验证或更新。

Method: 通过预训练策略将事实知识分别存储在模型权重和外部数据库中，并屏蔽外部检索值以引导模型主动查询而非记忆。

Result: LMLM在标准测试中性能媲美更大规模的知识密集型LLM，同时具备显式知识库的编辑和验证优势。

Conclusion: 该研究从根本上改变了语言模型与事实知识的交互方式，实现了更透明的知识管理。

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and
factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This
entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update
specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory
Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge
in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically
masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby
teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on
memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve
competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs
on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable,
and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how
language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

*Anirudh Maiya,Razan Alghamdi,Maria Leonor Pacheco,Ashutosh Trivedi,Fabio Somenzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决数独谜题时表现有限，且无法提供反映战略推理的解释，突显了人机协作决策中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在人类与AI协作决策中的有效性，特别是在需要逐步和定制化解释的复杂任务（如数独）中的应用。

Method: 评估了五种LLMs在解决和解释六乘六数独谜题中的表现。

Result: 一种LLM在解决谜题方面表现有限，但所有模型均无法提供反映战略推理或直观问题解决过程的解释。

Conclusion: LLMs在成为有效的人机协作决策伙伴前，需克服在解释能力方面的重大挑战。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative
decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and
tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a
canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized
explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining
\sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving
puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects
strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore
significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective
partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过利用波斯语在线医疗数据增强小型语言模型的医学知识，首次创建了波斯语医疗领域数据集，并通过微调基准模型提升了其在医疗问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语等低资源语言的小型语言模型在专业医疗领域表现不佳，且缺乏高质量的医疗数据集。研究旨在通过开放获取的在线数据解决这一问题。

Method: 从波斯语医疗杂志和真实医患问答对中爬取数据，构建首个波斯语医疗数据集，并基于此微调基准语言模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在医疗问答任务中表现出更高的准确性，生成的回答质量优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用开放获取的在线数据可以有效增强小型语言模型在医疗领域的性能，为资源受限环境下的波斯语医疗AI应用提供了新方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of
artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language
models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like
Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated
dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This
study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model
by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical
magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a
baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge.
Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved
accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared
to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access
online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a
novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for
resource-constrained environments.

### [9] [Causal Interventions Reveal Shared Structure Across English Filler-Gap Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16002)
*Sasha Boguraev,Christopher Potts,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨如何通过因果可解释性方法分析大语言模型（LLMs），以增强其对句法理论的贡献，并揭示影响语言理论的新因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望通过分析LLMs的内部机制，为语言学理论提供更深入的证据，并探索这些模型如何学习抽象的句法结构。

Method: 采用分布式交换干预（Distributed Interchange Interventions）实验方法，分析LLMs对英语填充-空缺依赖结构（如疑问句、关系从句）的处理机制。

Result: 研究发现LLMs对这些结构具有相似的抽象分析，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等先前被忽视的因素，这些发现可能推动语言学理论的修正。

Conclusion: 通过机制性内部分析，LLMs不仅能验证现有语言学理论，还能推动其进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for
linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that
causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value
of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs
learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency
constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely
agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based
in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar
abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously
overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding
context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall,
these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push
linguistic theory forward.

### [10] [SLMEval: Entropy-Based Calibration for Human-Aligned Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16003)
*Roland Daynauth,Christopher Clarke,Krisztian Flautner,Lingjia Tang,Jason Mars*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMEval是一种基于熵最大化的新型校准方法，显著提升了语言模型评估与人类判断的相关性，同时大幅降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准技术在真实开放任务中表现不佳，与人类判断相关性弱甚至负相关，亟需更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出SLMEval方法，通过人类偏好数据的熵最大化估计潜在质量分布，并重新加权评估分数。

Result: SLMEval在真实场景中与人类评估强相关（Spearman 0.57），成本降低5-30倍，显著优于G-Eval等基线。

Conclusion: SLMEval为开放任务提供了高效可靠的评估方案，验证了熵最大化校准在复杂场景的有效性。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for
evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been
proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies
focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains
unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these
settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To
address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method
based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By
estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator
scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations
across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For
example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with
human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition,
SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated
evaluators such as G-eval.

### [11] [LAGO: Few-shot Crosslingual Embedding Inversion Attacks via Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16008)
*Wenrui Yu,Yiyi Chen,Johannes Bjerva,Sokol Kosta,Qiongxiu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAGO提出了一种基于语言相似性的图优化方法，用于少样本跨语言嵌入反转攻击，显著提升了攻击的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言嵌入反转攻击方法独立处理各语言，忽略了语言间的相似性，导致隐私漏洞。本文旨在利用语言间关系提升攻击效果。

Method: 通过图约束分布式优化框架整合句法和词汇相似性，结合Frobenius范数正则化与线性不等式/全变差约束，实现跨语言参数协同学习。

Result: 实验表明LAGO在Rouge-L指标上比基线方法提升10-20%，证实语言相似性对攻击迁移性的关键作用。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了语言相似性在嵌入反转攻击中的重要性，呼吁开发更具语言感知能力的隐私保护多语言嵌入方法。

Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel
approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing
critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work
in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO
explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained
distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical
similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter
learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation
generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case
when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines
Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation
constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even
with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive
experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that
LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase
in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a
critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on
language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

*Yash Saxena,Anpur Padia,Mandar S Chaudhary,Kalpa Gunaratna,Srinivasan Parthasarathy,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出METEORA方法，通过基于理由的检索块选择替代传统RAG中的相似性重排序，提升生成准确性并增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG管道依赖基于相似性的检索和启发式重排序（如top-k），存在可解释性差、抗对抗内容能力弱的问题。

Method: 1) 使用偏好调优的LLM生成查询相关理由；2) 三阶段证据块选择：局部相关性配对、全局肘部检测自适应截断、上下文扩展；3) 通过验证LLM进行一致性检查过滤恶意内容。

Result: 在6个跨领域数据集上，生成准确率提升33.34%，证据块用量减少50%；对抗场景下F1分数从0.10提升至0.44。

Conclusion: METEORA通过理由驱动的可解释框架，显著提升RAG的准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on
similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as
top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against
adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA
that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.
METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is
preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using
direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk
selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing
individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,
global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context
expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k
heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier
LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.
The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using
rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation
across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains
shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using
approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In
adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to
0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating
strong resilience to poisoning attacks. Code available at:

*Wei Liu,Siya Qi,Xinyu Wang,Chen Qian,Yali Du,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出NOVER框架，无需外部验证器即可实现激励训练，在多种文本任务中表现优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激励训练方法依赖外部验证器，限制了其在数学和编程等领域的应用，且奖励模型训练成本高。

Method: 提出NOVER框架，仅需标准监督微调数据，无需外部验证器，支持广泛的文本到文本任务。

Result: NOVER在相同规模模型上比从大型推理模型蒸馏的模型性能提升7.7%，并支持逆向激励训练等新优化可能。

Conclusion: NOVER为大型语言模型优化提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，扩展了激励训练的应用范围。

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of
incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards
solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby
encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these
methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their
applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are
readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require
high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose
NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning
framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need
for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range
of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the
flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language
models, such as inverse incentive training.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂写作流程中的应用，用户通过多轮互动调整生成内容以满足需求。现有研究多关注任务分类或满意度评估，而本研究旨在深入分析用户与LLMs的实际协作行为。

Method: 研究对使用Bing Copilot和WildChat进行写作任务的用户进行大规模分析，识别用户在与LLMs交互过程中表现出的典型行为模式（PATHs），并分析这些行为与写作意图的关联。

Result: 研究发现少数几种PATHs（如修改意图、探索文本、提问、调整风格或注入新内容）解释了用户与LLMs交互中的大部分差异。特定写作意图与PATHs之间存在显著统计相关性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了用户与LLMs协作的实际模式，为LLMs的对齐（alignment）研究提供了新的视角和启示。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users
engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their
needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore,
and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative
behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI
assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task
classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead
characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We
identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts
following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI
Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a
majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users
revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or
injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations
between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape
their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of
our findings on LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文对29个开源大语言模型进行了广泛的伦理评估，涵盖鲁棒性、可靠性、安全性和公平性四个方面，并比较了英语和土耳其语的表现。结果显示，模型在安全和公平方面表现较好，但可靠性仍有待提升，且参数更多的模型伦理表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于狭窄的伦理维度和有限的语种及模型多样性。为了填补这些空白，本研究旨在通过更广泛的评估范围、语言覆盖和模型多样性，为大语言模型的伦理评估提供全面指导。

Method: 采用基于LLM-as-a-Judge的新数据收集方法，对29个开源大语言模型在英语和低资源语言土耳其语中的表现进行评估，涵盖鲁棒性、可靠性、安全性和公平性四个伦理维度。

Result: 实验结果表明，许多开源模型在安全和公平性方面表现良好，鲁棒性也不错，但可靠性仍是问题。参数更多的模型伦理表现更优，其中Gemma和Qwen模型表现最佳。伦理评估的有效性与语言无关。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大语言模型的伦理评估可以跨语言有效进行，模型参数规模与伦理表现正相关。这为更安全的模型开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise
critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and
also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we
conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language
models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects:
Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in
both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish.
Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model
development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage,
and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal
that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have
prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while
reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be
effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models
with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with
Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those
evaluated.

Motivation: 探究NLP研究在学术界内外的实际影响力差异，揭示不同主题的传播特征。

Method: 通过分析ACL/EMNLP/NAACL论文的学术引用及专利/媒体/政策文件等外部引用数据。

Result: 语言模型影响力最大；伦理话题政策关注度高但学术引用少；专利偏好应用，媒体关注社会影响。

Conclusion: NLP研究的内外部影响力总体一致，但不同领域存在显著偏好差异。

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences
(i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from
research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy
documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the
academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language
modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic
foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external
impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show
significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations.
Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents
focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging
more with the societal implications of NLP models.

TL;DR: 本文评估了小型Transformer模型在文本分类任务中的表现，重点关注工业场景下的效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等大型模型的出现，解码器模型在文本分类任务中表现出色，但存在推理效率低、依赖提示质量及GPU资源需求高的问题，因此探讨小型模型的有效性成为重要课题。

Method: 通过综合评估提示工程和监督微调方法，针对工业场景（如邮件分类、法律文档分类等）进行实验，分析小型模型的性能与显存效率。

Result: 研究揭示了小型模型在文本分类任务中的潜力与局限，为工业场景中的本地化部署提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 小型模型在特定工业场景中可有效替代大型模型，但需权衡性能与资源消耗，未来需进一步探索模型选择与方法优化。

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced
text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama
exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency
on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text
classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their
substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus,
the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively
handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest.
However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text
classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios,
including email classification, legal document categorization, and the
classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and
limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their
performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM)
utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and
application of compact models in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过标注政治新闻中的意识形态偏见，支持开发透明且社会意识强的自然语言处理系统。

Method: 从900篇文章中筛选300篇，通过众包标注民主党和共和党的情感倾向，并加入理由指示符，同时使用GPT-4o模拟标注进行比较。

Result: 量化了标注者间一致性，分析了与媒体偏见的不对齐，并展示了GPT-4o与人类标注的差异，特别是在右倾内容上的误分类。

Conclusion: BiasLab数据集和标注方法为可解释偏见检测提供了基础，支持开发更透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for
perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated
900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each
article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing
sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with
rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker
qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify
inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias,
and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we
simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison
to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in
misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks:
perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report
baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection.
BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that
facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development
of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation
schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop
interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现代BPE分词器常将日期分割成无意义片段，影响时间推理。本文提出日期碎片化比率指标、DateAugBench测试集，并发现大模型能通过注意力机制重组日期片段进行推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BPE分词器在处理日期时会将连续数字分割成无意义片段（如20250312→202,503,12），导致时间推理能力下降。

Method: 1) 提出日期碎片化比率指标；2) 发布包含6500个样本的DateAugBench测试集；3) 通过分层探测和注意力跳数分析研究模型重组日期片段的能力。

Result: 1) 过度碎片化导致历史/未来日期准确率下降10%；2) 模型越大，日期重组能力越强；3) 发现LLM采用'年→月→日'的推理路径（与人类不同）。

Conclusion: 日期碎片化损害时间推理性能，但大语言模型能通过注意力机制自发重组日期片段，且模型规模与重组效率正相关。

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments,
e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring
the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we
(1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation
ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date
components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three
temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance
puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future
regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses,
uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models
stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal
reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with
accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and
futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the
emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we
observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically
differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$
day).

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了bRAGgen模型，一种基于RAG的自适应系统，用于改善减肥与代谢手术患者的医疗信息获取，并通过bRAGq数据集验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减肥与代谢手术（MBS）虽为严重肥胖的金标准治疗，但患者获取多学科团队支持的途径存在障碍，导致信息获取不及时或不准确。

Method: 提出bRAGgen模型，通过动态阈值触发实时医学证据整合；并构建bRAGq数据集（1,302个专业问题）作为评估基准。

Result: bRAGgen在LLM指标和专家评估中均显著优于现有模型，生成响应更准确且临床相关。

Conclusion: bRAGgen能有效解决MBS领域信息差距，其自适应架构为临床决策提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard
treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon
active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including
surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This
engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to
long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by
numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which
impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed
information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates
real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic
thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain
current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we
present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions,
validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first
large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a
two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models
using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review.
Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior
performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为分层安全重校准（HSR）的轻量级方法，用于解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）剪枝后安全性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）规模的增大，网络剪枝技术在资源受限环境中的部署受到广泛关注。然而，剪枝往往会导致模型的安全性能下降。

Method: HSR通过量化每个注意力头对安全性的贡献，识别关键注意力头，并选择性恢复这些头中起关键作用的神经元，从而分层重校准剪枝后模型的安全性。

Result: HSR在不同模型和剪枝策略下均显著提升了安全性能。

Conclusion: 这是首个专注于在剪枝后恢复LVLM安全性能的工作，HSR方法有效且轻量。

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network
pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in
resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However,
we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To
address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed
Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the
contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical
ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention
heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process
hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the
attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models
and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on
restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多聚焦Python模拟代码式输入，忽略了其他编程语言（如C++、Java）在监督微调阶段的潜力。编程语言的结构化特性更适合信息抽取任务。

Method: 提出MPL框架，在监督微调阶段整合多种编程语言，并设计function-prompt结合虚拟运行机制，高效模拟代码式输入。

Result: 在多数据集上验证了MPL的有效性，并通过大量实验提供了全面分析。代码已开源。

Conclusion: MPL框架通过多编程语言与虚拟运行机制，显著提升了信息抽取任务的结构化输出能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing
code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind
this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater
structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage
makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research
primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the
potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple
\textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for
information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that
explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase.
Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to
simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental
results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive
analysis. We have released our code for future research.

Motivation: 社交媒体用户生成内容(UGC)对旅游决策至关重要，但现有分析方法缺乏可扩展性，需要更精准的期望量化工具推动旅游业发展。

Method: 采用双方法LLM框架：无监督提取UGC中的期望+基于调查数据的监督微调，实现旅游期望的量化分析。

Result: 研究发现休闲社交期望比基础的自然/情感因素更能驱动用户参与，验证了LLM在期望量化中的精确性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推进了旅游分析方法论，其适应性还可扩展至消费者行为研究，展示了计算社会科学在营销优化中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Social media's rise establishes user-generated content (UGC) as pivotal for
travel decisions, yet analytical methods lack scalability. This study
introduces a dual-method LLM framework: unsupervised expectation extraction
from UGC paired with survey-informed supervised fine-tuning. Findings reveal
leisure/social expectations drive engagement more than foundational
natural/emotional factors. By establishing LLMs as precision tools for
expectation quantification, we advance tourism analytics methodology and
propose targeted strategies for experience personalization and social travel
promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research,
demonstrating computational social science's transformative potential in
marketing optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在语言学深度和类型学基础上存在不足，KoBALT旨在填补这一空白，特别是在形态丰富的韩语中。

Method: KoBALT包含专家精心设计的700道选择题，涵盖24种语言现象，分布在五个语言学领域，确保与标准韩语语料库的最小n-gram重叠。

Result: 评估20个当代大型语言模型显示，最高性能模型的总体准确率为61%，但在不同语言学领域表现差异显著，语义表现最佳（66%），音系（31%）和形态学（36%）表现较弱。

Conclusion: KoBALT通过人类偏好评估验证了其作为韩语理解判别性测量的有效性，为评估韩语语言模型的真实语言能力提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a
comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice
questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed
to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a
morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional
benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It
introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with
minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating
the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true
language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals
significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model
achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across
linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to
considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through
human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong
correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our
benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language
understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for
typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing
genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）明确反对人口统计刻板印象，但在不同社会背景下仍表现出偏见。本文旨在揭示LLMs在解决方案真实性方面对人口统计的偏见。

Method: 通过对五种人类价值观对齐的LLMs进行数学、编程、常识和写作问题的实验，研究揭示了两种形式的真实性偏见：归因偏见和评估偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs普遍存在偏见：在数学和编程中，非裔美国人群体被归因更少的正确解决方案和更多的错误解决方案；在写作评估中，亚裔作者的作品最不受青睐。此外，LLMs在可视化代码中自动为人口统计群体分配种族刻板印象的颜色。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，人口统计偏见超越了表面刻板印象和社会背景挑衅，引发了LLMs在教育和评估环境中部署的担忧。

Abstract: Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have
been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we
find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution
veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned
LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two
forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models
disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups,
and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies
based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases:
LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to
African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least
preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs
automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in
visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models'
reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond
surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns
about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接使用大语言模型（LLM）进行机器翻译质量评估（MTQE）的方法在片段级别与人工评分的相关性较低，需要更有效的评估范式。

Method: 采用基于生成的评估范式，利用仅解码器架构的LLM生成高质量参考译文，再通过句子嵌入进行语义相似度评分。

Result: 在8种LLM和8种语言对的广泛测试中，该方法优于直接评分基线和非LLM的无参考指标，展示了生成式评估的优势。

Conclusion: 研究支持向结合流畅生成与精准语义评估的混合方法转变，验证了生成式评估在MTQE中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine
translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric
scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low
segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a
generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to
produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using
sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE,
covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method
outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM
reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of
generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that
combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在不同语言中的位置偏见现象及其与模型不确定性、句法和提示方式的相互作用。

Method: 跨语言研究，涵盖五种类型学不同的语言（英语、俄语、德语、印地语、越南语），分析位置偏见与模型行为的关系。

Result: 1) 位置偏见因模型而异，如Qwen2.5-7B偏好后置信息；2) 明确位置指导会降低准确性；3) 熵值增加不预示准确性；4) 自由语序语言中模型强加主导词序。

Conclusion: 位置偏见是模型固有特性，语言多样性影响其表现，当前提示工程方法需重新评估。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of
information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic
diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across
five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi,
Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty,
syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with
language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging
assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g.,
correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages,
undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional
bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We
further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in
free-word-order languages like Hindi.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLKD框架，通过强化学习蒸馏教师模型的多分支推理结构，提升小语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）蒸馏的推理路径仅反映教师模型的表层轨迹，无法传递其隐含的多分支推理结构。认知神经科学指出，真实推理包含元推理（子问题选择）与求解的复杂交织。

Method: 提出RLKD框架：1) 设计生成式结构奖励模型（GSRM），将推理路径分解为元推理-求解步骤并计算结构对齐奖励；2) 结合强化学习使学生模型内化教师的多分支推理结构。

Result: 实验表明，RLKD在仅使用0.1%数据的纯强化学习设定下，仍超越标准SFT-RL流程，释放出比SFT蒸馏更强的学生模型推理潜力。

Conclusion: RLKD通过结构化奖励建模和强化学习，实现了对教师模型隐含推理结构的有效蒸馏，为提升小语言模型推理能力提供了新路径。

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by
teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying
authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that
authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning
(which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving
(which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an
implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich
structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning
path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To
address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model
(GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving
steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and
teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to
internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than
merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard
SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,
unlocking greater student reasoning potential than SFT-based distillation.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在教育领域的应用尚未充分探索和优化，缺乏针对教育场景的专用评估基准和指标。

Method: 构建包含9大教育场景的合成数据集，设计12维评估指标，采用人工标注验证模型输出质量，并基于该数据集训练轻量级模型。

Result: 训练的小规模模型在测试集上达到与Deepseek V3、Qwen Max等顶尖大模型相当的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为教育导向的语言模型开发与评估提供了实践基础，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models continue to advance, their application in
educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper,
we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for
educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major
scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive
assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover
12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply
human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation
responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on
our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance
comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on
the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the
development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data

TL;DR: KNN-SSD算法通过KNN搜索匹配不同跳层与领域输入，提升自推测解码的领域泛化能力，实现LLM推理加速1.3x-1.6x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自推测解码（SSD）通过跳层构建草稿模型虽节省参数，但对领域迁移敏感，导致加速性能显著下降。

Method: 提出KNN-SSD算法，利用K近邻搜索动态适配不同领域输入与跳层配置。

Result: 在多模型多任务测试中，KNN-SSD实现1.3至1.6倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: KNN-SSD有效增强推测解码的领域适应性，为LLM高效推理提供新方案。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate
the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation
quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model
and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably,
Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the
draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training.
Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer
skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a
substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain
generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that
leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers
with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and
multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in
LLM inference.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管某些大语言模型配置能匹配人类平均表现和词汇偏好，但无法模拟人类在音素流畅性任务中的个体差异和行为多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型（LLMs）能否替代人类参与认知任务，并模拟人类行为的变异性，特别是在音素流畅性任务中的个体差异。

Method: 评估了34种模型配置（包括提示特异性、采样温度和模型类型），并将输出与106名人类参与者的反应进行比较。

Result: 某些配置（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）能匹配人类平均值和词汇偏好，但所有模型均无法复现人类行为的多样性，输出结构僵化且多样性不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类认知和行为方面存在关键局限性，尤其是在重现人类行为变异性方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for
human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human
behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can
approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where
participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34
model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and
model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants.
While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages
and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM
outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM
ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed
fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These
results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and
behavior.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）是否会承认自身错误，并定义了“撤回”行为。研究发现，虽然LLMs能够撤回错误答案，但频率较低，且撤回行为与模型的内部信念密切相关。通过监督微调可显著提升撤回表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解LLMs何时及为何会撤回之前生成的错误答案，尤其是当这些答案与模型自身的参数知识相矛盾时。目的是揭示模型内部信念如何影响其撤回行为。

Method: 研究首先构建了模型特定的数据集来评估模型是否会撤回与自身知识矛盾的错误答案。通过实验验证了内部信念与撤回行为的因果关系，并进行了监督微调实验。

Result: LLMs能够撤回错误答案，但频率较低。撤回行为与模型的内部信念紧密相关：模型不会撤回其“认为”正确的错误答案。监督微调显著提升了模型的撤回表现。

Conclusion: LLMs的撤回行为受其内部信念驱动，通过监督微调可帮助模型建立更准确的内部信念，从而改善撤回能力。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know
better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in
previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why
LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate
whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own
parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only
infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously
identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong
answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments
further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction.
In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only
encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention
behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple
supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping
the model learn more accurate internal beliefs. Code and datasets are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 健康信息的理解对维持健康至关重要，但生成式AI简化文本时可能遗漏关键信息，影响理解。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 收集50篇健康文本，用GPT-4简化后，采用五种策略（补全缺失实体/词汇、添加GPT-4排名前三实体、随机添加实体作为对照）修复文本，并通过余弦相似度和ROUGE评分评估效果。

Result: 添加所有缺失实体的方法在文本重建中表现最优，优于添加排名靠前实体或随机实体。现有工具能识别缺失实体，但排序能力不足。

Conclusion: 生成式AI简化健康信息时需针对性补全缺失实体，当前工具需改进实体重要性排序功能以提升简化质量。

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a
healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better
understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification
process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms
remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we
compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text,
evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We
collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We
compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by
inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing
entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities,
2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613,
and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities.
We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity
and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed
simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find
that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities
resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the
top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these
entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了混合训练如何通过塑造共享参数提升语言模型的事实回忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型具备强大的通用能力，但事实回忆（检索特定事实知识）仍是挑战。传统两阶段训练易导致死记硬背，而混合训练虽有效但机制不明。

Method: 引入跨任务梯度追踪技术，分析Llama-3.2B和Pythia-2.8B模型在合成数据集上的参数共享模式。

Result: 混合训练能形成更大、更集中的共享参数集，这些参数对事实存储和回忆任务均有响应。

Conclusion: 共享参数的出现可能是语言模型跨任务泛化事实知识的关键机制。

Abstract: Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific
factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general
capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust
recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with
fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling
examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather
than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly
uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability
to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In
this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model
parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their
ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify
shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and
fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with
the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a
larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest
that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to
generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

Motivation: 大语言模型在开放生成场景中行为控制仍具挑战性，需要更可靠且可解释的干预方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器获取解耦表征，训练线性分类器定位任务相关子空间，并学习约束在该子空间的监督引导向量。

Result: 在情感/真实性/政治倾向等任务中，该方法比现有技术成功率更高且生成质量下降更小，仅需极小表征子空间即可实现有效控制。

Conclusion: 稀疏表征空间的监督引导可实现精准、可解释的模型行为干预，为可控文本生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior
reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings.
This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in
sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders
(SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic
attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify
a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations.
Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace,
optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment,
truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs
demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates
with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods.
Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for
effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

Motivation: 探索情绪、身体体验与日常语言之间的关联，填补自然语言处理、情感科学与健康研究交叉领域的空白。

Method: 构建在线英文文本（博客和推文）中身体部位提及的语料库，结合人工标注情绪标签及词-情绪关联词典进行分析。

Result: BPMs在个人叙事和推文中占比5%-10%，其使用模式受时空影响；含BPM的文本情绪更强烈，且与较差的健康结果显著相关。

Conclusion: 身体部位相关语言研究为NLP、情感科学及人类福祉的交叉研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion,
embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data.
We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog
posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the
emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that
BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include
BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic
location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we
show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when
the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion
in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant
correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health
outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related
words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the
intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

Motivation: 多模态情感分析（MSA）在零样本范式下表现不理想，研究旨在验证MLLMs是否具备与监督模型相当的情感感知能力。

Method: 扩展零样本范式至上下文学习（ICL），深入研究演示配置，包括检索、呈现和分布三个关键因素，并发现并抵消MLLMs的情感预测偏差。

Result: 优化后的策略在六个MSA数据集上平均准确率比零样本范式提高15.9%，比随机ICL基线提高11.2%。

Conclusion: MLLMs通过优化演示配置具备情感分析能力，为多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This
paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend
in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a
pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to
accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable
performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as
competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to
In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring
demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability.
Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval,
presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized.
A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later
effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies
for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA
datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL
baseline.

Motivation: 尽管自动语音识别（ASR）技术取得了显著进展，但准确转录儿童语音仍是一个重大挑战。大型语言模型（LLMs）在改善ASR转录方面显示出潜力，但其在儿童对话语音中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究通过在两个儿童对话语音数据集上进行实验，评估了LLMs在零样本和微调ASR输出中的表现，包括CTC-based和自回归ASR（如Whisper）模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在纠正零样本ASR输出和微调CTC-based ASR输出时有效，但在结合上下文信息或处理微调自回归ASR输出时效果有限。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在改善儿童对话语音的ASR转录方面具有潜力，但在处理复杂上下文或特定ASR模型输出时仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress,
but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge.
Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech
including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore
the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We
demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two
children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned
ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR
outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs
to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when
using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

Method: 构建包含六种语言的MIDAS习语数据集，系统评估LLMs的习语处理能力，分析影响性能的关键因素。

Result: LLMs不仅依赖记忆，还会结合上下文线索和推理处理习语，尤其对组合型习语表现出混合理解策略。

Conclusion: LLMs的习语理解能力源于内部知识检索与推理推断的交互作用，这为改进模型习语处理提供了新见解。

Abstract: Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties,
which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks,
e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs,
particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new
large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its
corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that
influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on
memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues
and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies
that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal
knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）被广泛用于代码评估任务，其在不依赖参考实现的情况下评估生成代码正确性的能力受到关注。然而，LLM是否能公平且稳健地评估语义相同但表面形式不同的代码仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 研究定义了六种代码评估中的潜在偏见类型，并在五种编程语言和多个LLM上进行了实证分析，测试了LLM评估者在处理代码表面变化时的表现。

Result: 所有测试的LLM评估者都表现出对代码表面变化的敏感，导致评分偏高或偏低。即使要求LLM在评分前生成测试用例，这种偏见依然存在。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，当前LLM评估代码的方法存在局限性，需要开发更稳健的代码评估方法以减少偏见。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their
application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the
correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations.
While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical,
unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically
equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often
exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or
formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges
can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first
comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code
evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five
programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all
tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases,
resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM
judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test
cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation
methods.

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统探索了基于开源语言模型的高效、低资源个性化术语检测方法，为可扩展、用户自适应的NLP系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making
technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires
substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific
finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized
jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for
real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1)
lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models,
and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time
without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid
approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user
background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in
F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably,
our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated
training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained
settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient,
low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language
models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Motivation: 传统人工评估创意想法原创性的方法效率低、易出错且难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLM)和检索增强生成(RAG)框架，自动检索相似想法并分类，计算原创性分数。

Result: 在五个数据集上，MuseRAG与人工标注的聚类结构(AMI=0.59)和评分(r=0.89)高度一致，具有良好效度。

Conclusion: MuseRAG实现了大规模、符合人类评估标准的原创性自动化评分，助力创造力研究。

Abstract: An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is
to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used
in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response
frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated,
psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring.
Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally
orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea,
the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot
prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or
forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based
originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG
matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI =
0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong
convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive,
human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel.
Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate
prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on
evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet
length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following
Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to
follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified
lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in
both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192
words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably
follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain
threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed
maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations
extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended
input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions
following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall,
LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions
following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

TL;DR: Align-GRAG通过双对齐框架优化图RAG系统，解决信息检索中的无关节点和表示差异问题，提升生成答案的准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在幻觉和过时信息问题，图RAG系统虽能通过检索子图提供更全面的上下文，但仍面临无关节点干扰和图-语言表示差异的挑战。

Method: 提出Align-GRAG框架，在检索后阶段通过图编码器与LLM推理的双对齐（KL散度损失和对比损失），剪枝无关知识并建立统一语义空间，生成器整合对齐后的图数据与LLM输出答案。

Result: 在GraphQA基准测试的三个任务（常识推理、场景图理解、知识图谱推理）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Align-GRAG通过双对齐机制显著提升了图RAG系统的性能，为复杂知识推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM
outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system.
Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by
retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge
entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two
challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes
(especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to
adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2)
The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs
limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced
understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel
reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first
formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is
proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It
achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL
divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of
irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator
integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate
answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common
sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning)
validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon
accepted.

TL;DR: SEAL是一种针对大型推理模型的新型越狱攻击方法，通过自适应加密管道绕过安全机制，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽具备强大逻辑能力，但其潜在安全漏洞未被充分探索。现有越狱方法在有效性与对抗自适应安全机制的鲁棒性之间难以平衡。

Method: SEAL采用堆叠加密方法，结合多种密码扰乱模型推理能力，并引入动态策略（随机和自适应）调整密码长度、顺序和组合，以规避自适应对齐。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1、Claude Sonnet和GPT-o4等模型上的实验表明，SEAL对GPT-o4-mini的攻击成功率达80.8%，超出基线方法27.2%。

Conclusion: SEAL通过创新加密策略有效突破LRMs的安全防护，揭示了强推理能力模型可能面临的新型安全风险。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical
capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining
significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for
stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities
remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to
balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In
this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through
an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes
and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked
encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models
reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To
further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two
dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length,
order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models,
including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of
80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant
margin of 27.2%. Warning: This paper contains examples of inappropriate,

TL;DR: 论文提出Diverse-NS框架，通过控制输出长度提升语言模型多样性，仅需3000对偏好数据即可有效训练，并在多个任务中验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多样性指标和偏好优化奖励模型存在对短输出的系统性偏差，限制了语言模型的表达能力，需要一种方法在保持长度一致的同时提升多样性。

Method: 引入Diverse-NS框架，通过生成并筛选平衡多样性、质量和长度的偏好数据，进行长度可控的自学习训练。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Olmo-2系列模型上，Diverse-NS显著提升了词汇和语义多样性，且在四个创意生成任务中保持或提升响应质量。意外发现小模型（如Olmo-2-7B）可作为大模型的“多样性教师”。

Conclusion: 通过显式解决长度偏差，Diverse-NS高效推动了模型生成更多样化、更具表现力的输出。

Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation,
open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity
metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization,
systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To
address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled
self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining
length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances
diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using
only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family,
Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show
consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response
quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona
Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments
with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like
Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By
explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward
more diverse and expressive outputs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型知识遗忘的有效性，挑战了局部参数更新必然导致有效知识移除的核心假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常保留非预期内容，引发对知识遗忘的兴趣。现有局部遗忘方法假设参数局部性与知识移除效果相关，但其有效性未经验证。

Method: 通过对照实验重新评估现有局部遗忘方法，检验局部参数更新是否因果性促进遗忘。

Result: 发现有效遗忘所需的参数修改并不严格确定，挑战了局部遗忘的核心假设。

Conclusion: 参数局部性并非知识移除的有效指标，局部遗忘方法的理论基础需重新审视。

Abstract: Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing
interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized
unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort
to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge.
However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and
thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning.
In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches.
We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local
parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that
the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not
strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning
that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge
removal.

Abstract: Interpreting figurative language such as sarcasm across multi-modal inputs
presents unique challenges, often requiring task-specific fine-tuning and
extensive reasoning steps. However, current Chain-of-Thought approaches do not
efficiently leverage the same cognitive processes that enable humans to

leverages Multi-modal Coherence Relations to analyze referential, analogical
and pragmatic image-text linkages. Our experiments show that IRONIC achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across
different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Transformer Copilot的新框架，通过记录和利用模型自身的学习信号来优化微调过程，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的微调方法仅关注最小化生成损失，而忽略了模型自身的学习信号。作者认为，类似于人类通过反思错误来提升学习效果，模型也应利用自身的学习行为来改进性能。

Method: 论文引入了Mistake Log来系统记录模型的学习行为和错误，并设计了Copilot模型来修正Pilot模型的推理输出。整体框架包括Copilot模型设计、联合训练范式以及融合推理范式。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，Transformer Copilot将模型性能提升了高达34.5%，同时仅带来边际计算开销，并展现出良好的可扩展性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Transformer Copilot框架通过利用模型自身的学习信号，显著提升了微调效果，为大型语言模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through
supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning
focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a
deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals,
analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future
performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically
track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout
fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we
correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference
performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot
framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model
design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns
from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference
paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced
generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new
learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense,
arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot
consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal
computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and
transferability.

Method: 方法包括从自发语音语料库中提取语言生成变量（如语音缩减和韵律突出），并测试不同预训练数据集（书面、口语和混合类型）训练的模型预测这些变量的能力。

Conclusion: 结论认为，使用高质量语音语料库作为大语言模型的基准测试工具有助于更全面地评估其性能。

Abstract: The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing,
especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of
their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted
to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral
(e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses)
variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper,
we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables
(speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar
fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a
standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and
mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results
show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production
variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data
provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results
contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as
benchmarks for LLMs.

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的机器翻译评估方法在错误定位和严重性评估上存在不足，未能充分利用多维质量指标(MQM)的细粒度信息。

Method: 基于MQM错误类型学构建分层多智能体系统，结合自我反思能力和非对称信息讨论策略以减少系统幻觉。

Result: HiMATE在不同数据集上优于基线方法，错误检测F1值平均提升89%，评估结果更贴近人类判断。

Conclusion: HiMATE框架通过分层多智能体协同机制，显著提升了机器翻译评估的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and
interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation
evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments.
However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in
accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper,
we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation
Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the
fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To
address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM
error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key
strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within
the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and
the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information.
Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets
in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its
significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment,
achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing
baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at

Motivation: 迭代RAG在多跳问答中面临长上下文和无关信息积累的挑战，限制了模型处理检索内容的能力和性能。现有方法多局限于单轮RAG或缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提出Notes Writing方法，在每一步从检索文档生成简洁相关的笔记，减少噪声并保留关键信息，间接增加LLM的有效上下文长度。

Result: 在三种迭代RAG方法、两个模型和四个评估数据集上，Notes Writing平均提升了15.6个百分点，且输出标记增加极少。

Conclusion: Notes Writing是一种框架无关的方法，能有效提升迭代RAG的性能，适用于处理大量输入文本。

Abstract: Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy
contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's
capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance.
While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are
either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability
in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a
method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at
each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information.
This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing
larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be
integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its
effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four
evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6
percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)因高延迟和能耗难以部署在资源受限场景，传统知识蒸馏方法(FKL/RKL)采用统一损失函数，忽略了词元级预测差异。

Method: 提出基于sigmoid加权函数的Token-wise蒸馏(ToDi)，根据师生模型概率对数比动态分配FKL和RKL的权重。

Result: ToDi在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有蒸馏方法，消融实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ToDi通过细粒度词元级蒸馏策略，实现了更精确的分布对齐，兼具实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical
for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption.
Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a
large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably
approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence
loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction
discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient
analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses
overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this
observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that
adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting
function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi
dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling
precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently
outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular
strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies
and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

Result: 在BBH、GSM8K等任务上超越基线方法，AlpacaEval 2.0胜率提升19+点，且适用于不同规模模型。

Conclusion: PMPO提供了一种高效、通用且无需人工干预的提示优化方案。

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to
fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However,
existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing
abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability,
especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO
(Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines
prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight
evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and
measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by
minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it
requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying
only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and
preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation
strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods
across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH,
performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates
by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency,

Conclusion: CLEAR提供了更全面、临床可解释的放射学报告评估方法。

Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture
nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology
reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded
tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for
Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report
can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also
assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition
across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive
location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's
multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and
clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure
the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified
radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from
MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions.
Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical
attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with
clinical judgment.

Conclusion: 论文确定了评估学术论文新颖性的最优部分组合，为自动化新颖性评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple
perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word
or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to
a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections,
e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal
combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for
advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different
combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language
models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the
optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ
natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of
academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and
discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these
sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language
models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores
provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction
results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion
is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the
entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the
results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the
most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and

TL;DR: 论文提出MEMENTO框架，评估具身智能体利用记忆提供个性化协助的能力，发现现有模型在多记忆引用任务中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有具身智能体在家庭物品重排任务中表现优异，但主要关注单轮交互和简化指令，未能真正反映个性化协助的挑战。需要理解用户对物理世界的独特语义（如喜好、习惯），并利用历史交互来解析动态指令。

Method: 提出MEMENTO框架，采用两阶段记忆评估流程：（1）基于个人语义识别目标物体；（2）从用户习惯推断物品-位置配置，量化记忆利用对任务性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs（包括GPT-4o）在需要引用多条记忆时性能下降30.5%，尤其在涉及用户习惯的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型在记忆利用上的局限性，为开发更有效的个性化具身智能体提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks
primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which
do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to
users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the
unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup,
breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret
dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in
utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To
address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation
framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to
provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory
evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory
utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents'
understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by
focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target
objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to
infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as
routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal
significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like
GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference
multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These
findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable
insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied
agents. Project website: https://connoriginal.github.io/MEMENTO

*Songlin Yang,Yikang Shen,Kaiyue Wen,Shawn Tan,Mayank Mishra,Liliang Ren,Rameswar Panda,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为PaTH的新型位置编码方案，通过数据依赖的Householder变换增强Transformer的表达能力，优于现有的RoPE等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RoPE位置编码仅依赖相对位置而忽略输入内容，限制了Transformer的表达能力。

Method: 基于数据依赖的Householder变换乘积构建位置编码，采用并行训练算法和FlashAttention风格的分块计算优化IO成本。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际语言建模任务中，PaTH性能显著优于RoPE及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PaTH通过数据感知的位置编码机制，为Transformer模型提供了更强大的序列建模能力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models
(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,
position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as
language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard
approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in
RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a
function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual
input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme
based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each
transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an
efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact
representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a
FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both
targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling
experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to
RoPE and other recent baselines.

Conclusion: 研究揭示LLM跨语言能力的形成机制，为模型可解释性提供新见解，并提出可操作的性能提升方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual
tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their
interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we
propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn
cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the
word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in
the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior.
We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of
words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to
apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct
a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high
proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes
insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving
LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常依赖简单特征来衡量示例间的相关性，但这些特征不足以反映示例间的内在联系。

Method: 构建基于BREAK数据集的问题解决逻辑指令集，微调语言模型分析示例的问题解决逻辑，并根据课程学习原则排序示例。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能和效率上优于以往的上下文学习方法，有效提升了模型的复杂推理能力。

Conclusion: 基于问题解决逻辑的课程式上下文学习策略能显著提升大语言模型的推理能力，项目将公开。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with the key lying in the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. Previous methods typically
relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue
that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections
between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by
problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the
problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning.
Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on
the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the
problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate
demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their
difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with
the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to
hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in
terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available
subsequently.

TL;DR: 该论文针对自动文本简化(ATS)评估方法的不足，提出了一套错误分类体系及标注数据集，以提升简化文本的质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众常因复杂文本的理解障碍导致错误信息传播，而现有ATS评估方法无法有效检测大语言模型生成文本中的错误，亟需更精细的评估框架。

Method: 1. 提出信息失真导向的错误分类体系 2. 构建人工标注的科学文本简化平行语料库 3. 基于分类体系分析现有模型的错误检测能力

Result: 建立了首个面向ATS错误检测的标注数据集，验证了现有模型在错误分类上的性能局限，为质量评估提供新基准。

Conclusion: 该研究为ATS错误检测提供了标准化工具，可促进更可靠模型的开发，最终提升自动简化文本的质量。

Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time
or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation.
Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but
its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation,
especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies
have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of
errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors,
underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is
currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test
collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we
propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion.
Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific
texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed
taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the
performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that
taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate
errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality
of automatically simplified texts.

TL;DR: ULTRAEDIT提出了一种无需训练、主题无关且无需记忆的模型编辑方法，通过轻量级线性代数运算实现快速参数调整，适用于大规模终身学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法难以满足实际终身学习的需求，特别是在高效、广泛更新知识的同时保持现有能力和可靠部署方面存在挑战。

Method: ULTRAEDIT采用自包含的编辑过程，仅依赖轻量级线性代数运算计算参数偏移，并通过终身归一化策略适应分布变化。

Result: ULTRAEDIT编辑速度比现有最快方法快7倍以上，VRAM消耗不到1/3，支持高达100万次编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是目前唯一能在消费级GPU上编辑7B参数LLM的方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了语音处理中特征归因方法的可靠性，发现标准方法在语音领域普遍不可靠，除非在基于单词的分类任务中使用单词对齐扰动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模预训练模型能力的提升，理解其输出决定因素变得愈发重要。特征归因旨在揭示输入元素中哪些部分对模型输出贡献最大。然而，语音输入信号的独特特性使得特征归因方法的应用具有挑战性。

Method: 研究了输入类型、聚合和扰动时间跨度等因素如何影响标准特征归因方法的可靠性，以及这些因素如何与每个分类任务的特征相互作用。

Result: 标准特征归因方法在语音领域普遍不可靠，唯一的例外是在基于单词的分类任务中应用单词对齐扰动方法时表现可靠。

Conclusion: 标准特征归因方法在语音处理中的可靠性有限，需要针对特定任务（如基于单词的分类）采用专门的方法（如单词对齐扰动）以提高可靠性。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding
the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution
aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model
outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal
make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how
factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the
reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors
interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that
standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when
applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation
methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现仅依赖世界价值观调查(WVS)数据训练大语言模型(LLMs)会导致文化同质化，通过引入维基百科和NormAd的文化叙事可提升文化独特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用WVS数据对齐LLMs与文化价值观，但这种方法可能无法有效捕捉文化细微差别，且对下游任务的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统研究基于WVS的训练方法，并引入维基百科和NormAd的百科全书式及情景式文化叙事作为补充数据。

Result: 补充文化叙事虽对下游任务效果不一，但相比仅用调查数据能持续提升文化独特性，同时发现单纯依赖WVS会导致文化同质化并干扰事实知识。

Conclusion: 研究表明文化价值观对齐具有内在复杂性，需要结合多种数据源才能更好地指导任务特定行为。

Abstract: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant
challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work
primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey
(WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively
captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for
various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely
on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual
knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and
scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these
narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently
improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights
the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding
task-specific behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）通过大规模强化学习（RL）展现出卓越的推理能力，但如何利用RL算法实现有效的多工具协作推理仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: Tool-Star结合了六种工具，并提出了一个通用的工具集成推理数据合成流程，包括工具集成提示和基于提示的采样。此外，采用两阶段训练框架：冷启动微调和多工具自我批评RL算法。

Result: 在超过10个具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，Tool-Star展示了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Star通过系统设计和强化学习算法，成功提升了LLMs在多工具协作推理中的能力，为未来研究提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging
the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in
LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an
RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple
external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of
tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training.
To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated
reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting
with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use
trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware
classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the
dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start
fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via
tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with
hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes
effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging
reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star.

Motivation: 当前检索增强生成（RAG）模型在将生成内容可靠地归因于特定上下文时面临计算复杂度高的问题，通常需要大量微调或人工标注。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于Jensen-Shannon散度的方法（ARC-JSD），用于高效准确地识别关键上下文句子，无需额外微调或代理建模。

Result: 在多个RAG基准测试（如TyDi QA、Hotpot QA和Musique）上的评估表明，该方法在准确性和计算效率上均优于之前的代理方法。机制分析还揭示了负责上下文归因的特定注意力头和MLP层。

Conclusion: ARC-JSD方法不仅提升了RAG模型的性能，还通过机制分析提供了对模型内部工作原理的深入理解，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs)
combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of
generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to
specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the
computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require
extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel
Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context
(ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context
sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on
a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using
instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous
surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific
attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context
attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG
models.

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大语言模型方面取得了显著成功，但其主要集中于单轮任务（如数学问题求解）。由于动态网络界面中长期决策的复杂性，训练有效的多轮交互网络代理仍然具有挑战性。

Method: WebAgent-R1通过异步生成多样化的轨迹，直接从与网络环境的在线交互中学习，完全依赖于任务成功的二元奖励。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中，WebAgent-R1将Qwen-2.5-3B的任务成功率从6.1%提升至33.9%，Llama-3.1-8B从8.5%提升至44.8%，显著优于现有最先进方法和强大的专有模型。

Conclusion: WebAgent-R1通过思维提示策略和增加交互的测试时间扩展，展示了在网络任务中的有效性。进一步研究揭示了预热训练阶段的重要性，并提供了在网络代理中融入长链思维推理的见解。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn
tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for
multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of
long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we
present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework
for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web
environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided
by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task
success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to
44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong
proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the
effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling
through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different
RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero
and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training
stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Conclusion: 该研究为程序性语言与视觉内容的结合提供了新方法，可应用于教育、任务指导和多模态语言理解等领域。

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant
challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions
often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We
address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that
translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach
models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into
goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on
these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a
constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic
completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence
model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel
evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image
alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep,
CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect
the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work
contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in
visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and
multimodal language understanding.

Conclusion: RecInter平台为推荐系统研究提供了高可信度的模拟测试环境。

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional
A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic
user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing
platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the
environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based
simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction
mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews,
purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced
Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem.
High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling
module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved
simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like
Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this
interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution,
establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems
research.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了多标签情感分类在28种语言中的两种策略：完全微调Transformer模型和仅训练分类器，发现基于提示的编码器（如mE5和BGE）结合CatBoost分类器的集成模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提升多语言多标签情感分类的性能，探索不同微调策略和模型架构的效果。

Method: 比较了完全微调Transformer模型（如XLMR、mBERT）和仅训练分类器的方法，测试了不同配置（损失函数、编码器、分类器等）。

Result: 集成多个BGE模型并使用CatBoost分类器的方案在28种语言上平均F1-macro得分为56.58，显著优于完全微调方法。

Conclusion: 基于提示的编码器结合轻量级分类器的策略在多语言情感分类任务中更具优势，集成模型能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing
on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main
strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training,
evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model
architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest
that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE
yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our
best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining
multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different
configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58
across all languages.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）会从对话中的细微线索推断用户的 demographic 信息，导致对少数群体的回答质量下降。研究发现，即使用户明确表明身份，这种刻板印象驱动的推断仍存在。通过干预模型内部表征，可以有效缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索 LLM 如何基于刻板印象线索推断用户 demographic 信息，以及这种推断如何影响回答质量，尤其是对少数群体的影响。

Method: 方法包括使用受控合成对话分析 LLM 的潜在用户表征，通过模型内部和生成回答来研究刻板印象信号的影响。

Result: 结果表明，LLM 确实会基于刻板印象推断 demographic 属性，即使用户明确表明不同身份，这种推断仍存在。通过干预模型内部表征，可以有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要提高 LLM 在用户身份表征方面的透明度和控制，以减少刻板印象驱动的隐性个性化带来的负面影响。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information
from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit
personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower
quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no
demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically
explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic
conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through
both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our
findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these
stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user
explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that
this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively
mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a
trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our
results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs
represent user identity.

Motivation: 为了提高大语言模型在信息检索系统中的可靠性，确保其在提供上下文时的忠实性。

Method: 通过合成短文本问答数据构建高质量训练数据，并提出基于规则的强化学习方法Dual-GRPO，优化短文本和长文本生成。

Result: 实验表明，CANOE在11个下游任务中显著提升模型忠实度，甚至超越GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: CANOE框架有效提升大语言模型的忠实度，无需人工标注，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context
is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we
propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in
both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations.
Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with
four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training
data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based
reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards
derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing
both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO
eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models
and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the
synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly
improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even
outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

TL;DR: 该研究通过探测Llama模型的隐藏层，揭示了情感信息在模型中的分布特征，发现中层对二元情感任务最有效，准确率提升14%，且末token并非最佳情感编码位置，同时内存需求降低57%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）已广泛应用于NLP任务（如情感分析），但其内部如何编码情感信息仍不明确。本研究旨在定位Llama模型中情感特征的关键表征层，并评估其对情感分析的影响。

Method: 使用探针分类器分析不同层和规模的模型，识别最能捕捉情感信号的层和池化方法，重点关注解码器架构中token位置对情感编码的作用。

Result: 1) 二元情感任务中情感信息集中在中层，检测准确率比提示技术高14%；2) 仅解码器模型中末token并非最优情感编码位置；3) 平均内存需求降低57%。

Conclusion: 特定层探测是超越提示技术的有效情感分析方法，可提升模型效用并降低资源消耗，为理解LLMs中的情感表征提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP,
demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting
techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited
understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This
study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment
features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment
analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and
scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment
signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in
mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to
14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only
models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment
encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with
memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs,
suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks
beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory
requirements.

Motivation: 当前LegalAI研究多聚焦于个案判决分析，忽视了上诉程序的重要性。上诉作为纠错和保障审判公正的核心机制，具有重要研究和实践价值。

Method: 构建包含91类民事案件、标注五个关键维度的AppealCase数据集，并基于此提出五项新LegalAI任务，评估20个主流模型。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在判决逆转预测任务上F1值均低于50%，表明上诉场景的复杂性和挑战性。

Conclusion: AppealCase数据集有望促进上诉案件分析的深入研究，并提升司法决策一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment
analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial
system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring
fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research.
To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000
pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents
across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed
annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment
reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and
whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these
annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive
evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all
current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal
prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal
scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in
LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in
judicial decision-making.

Method: 开发CUB基准，测试七种最先进的上下文利用技术，涵盖三种上下文类型、三个数据集和九种语言模型。

Result: 多数现有技术难以处理真实场景中的多样化上下文，且在合成数据集上表现优于真实数据集。

Conclusion: 需要全面测试上下文利用技术，并开发能处理多种上下文类型的新方法。

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks,
such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs)
may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or
be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation
manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation
have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic
comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to
help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the
best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct
context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context
utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse
datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the
existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be
encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that
many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets,
compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples.
Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the
development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM事实性研究奠定基础，提供了更有效评估的实用指南，同时指出泛化到LLM生成数据仍具挑战性。

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or
fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false
statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness.
However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism,
which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text
generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of
previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to
the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we
extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible
true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for
generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering
collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the
findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to
LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for
future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more
effective evaluation.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在推理时仍存在偏见问题，且现有基准测试仅针对单一偏见类型，无法反映实际应用中多偏见共存的情况，亟需解决多偏见同时消除的挑战。

Method: 提出CMBE方法：1) 同时估计多类型偏见的因果效应；2) 从总因果效应中剔除偏见效应，保留语义信息对推理的影响。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs和去偏方法在多偏见基准上表现不佳，而CMBE能有效同时消除多类型偏见，显著提升模型泛化性。

Conclusion: 多偏见共存是实际应用中的关键挑战，CMBE通过因果效应估计实现多偏见联合消除，为提升LLMs鲁棒性提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current
large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading
to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to
investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically
containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may
contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types
of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the
performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying,
highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases
simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect
estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first
estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously.
Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal
effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference.
Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of
bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

Motivation: 小型大语言模型（sLLMs）在资源受限环境中具有轻量高效的优势，但在任务导向对话系统中难以保持主题一致性，可能导致对离题或恶意输入的无效处理。现有方法在确保主题一致性方面存在局限，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance（EnSToM）的新方法，通过基于输入不确定性的动态引导强度调整，有效处理离题干扰并保持主题准确性。

Result: 实验表明，EnSToM在较小数据规模下实现了显著的性能提升，相比微调方法更高效，且不损害模型效率。

Conclusion: EnSToM为提升基于sLLM的对话系统提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案，能够在保持高效的同时显著改善主题一致性。

Abstract: Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight
and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented
dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots.
Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or
malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent
potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation
engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations
during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our
preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence.
Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled
Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the
steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle
off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our
experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with
a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving
topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust
solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

Conclusion: 神经元级干预为多语言建模提供了可解释、鲁棒的改进方向，揭示了LLMs内部动态的新见解。

Abstract: Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended
languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially
for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability
(MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with
neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show
that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur
-- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens
and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the
final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set
of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with
multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming
general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in
confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality
outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs
and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust,
interpretable multilingual language modeling.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的思维链推理（CoT）存在计算开销大、效率低的问题，需寻求更高效的潜在空间推理方法。

Method: 1) 监督微调阶段：引入辅助目标预测压缩嵌入；2) 强化学习阶段：利用潜在头探索多样化推理路径并压缩。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoLaR比基线准确率提升14.1%，推理链长度减少53.3%；强化学习版进一步缩短82.8%推理链并提升5.4%性能。

Conclusion: CoLaR实现了高效潜空间推理，支持动态调整压缩率，为LLM推理效率提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are
computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce
Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically
compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training
approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token
prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction
objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a
compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a
specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed
embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that
leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse
reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to:
i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially
reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at
inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive
experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR
achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable
compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8%
performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied
to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR
demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent
reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large

To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on

abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight
distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define
category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with
the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each
domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual

LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and
5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an

Motivation: 探讨在大型语言模型预训练中，不同类型的上下文元数据（如来源、质量、主题等）对训练效率和下游任务表现的影响，以弥补当前研究的不足。

Method: 系统评估不同元数据类型（URL、质量评分、主题/格式）在预训练中的作用，分析其对训练速度、下游任务表现及生成控制的影响。

Result: 仅URL上下文能加速训练；质量评分和主题/格式元数据无显著效果。URL上下文需搭配长提示才能提升下游表现。主题和格式元数据可用于生成控制。

Conclusion: 上下文感知预训练比无上下文预训练更具可控性，特定元数据（如URL）能优化训练效率，而其他类型（如主题/格式）则适合生成控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text
without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic,
leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that
adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not
used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream
performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are
truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a
systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally.
Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format
domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream
performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at
inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining
enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a
classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not
accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering
human-interpretable control over generation.

*Spencer Hong,Meng Luo,Xinyi Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EMULATE的新型多智能体框架，用于更接近人类行为的事实核查系统，通过分阶段任务处理显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统通常依赖搜索引擎检索证据后直接分类，与人类逐步推理的过程不符。为解决这一问题，研究者希望开发更贴近人类行为模式的迭代式验证方法。

Method: 采用多智能体框架（EMULATE），每个智能体负责特定子任务（如搜索结果排序、网页内容评估），通过分工协作模拟人类分阶段推理过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法相比现有工作显示出明显改进，验证了多智能体框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类分阶段推理的多智能体设计，EMULATE系统为事实核查任务提供了更优的解决方案，为后续研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many
recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by
first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing
classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large
language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order
to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing
iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several
times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we
propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to
better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where
each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search
results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content.
Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior
work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

*Jianbiao Mei,Tao Hu,Daocheng Fu,Licheng Wen,Xuemeng Yang,Rong Wu,Pinlong Cai,Xing Gao,Yu Yang,Chengjun Xie,Botian Shi,Yong Liu,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出O$^2$-Searcher，一种利用强化学习处理开放域问题的搜索代理，显著提升开放性和封闭性问题的解答能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）受限于静态参数知识，难以处理需要最新开放域信息的任务，尤其是开放性问题。

Method: O$^2$-Searcher通过本地模拟搜索环境动态获取知识，结合强化学习和精心设计的奖励函数，适应不同类型的问题生成策略。

Result: 实验表明，O$^2$-Searcher在开放性问题基准O$^2$-QA上显著优于主流LLM代理，并在封闭性问题基准上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: O$^2$-Searcher有效解决了LLMs在开放域问题上的局限性，展示了小模型也能实现高性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally
limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks
requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact
with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts
primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which
characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse
answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a
novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both
open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher
leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic
knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from
model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training
mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to
identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies.
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct
O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain
open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments
show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses
leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various
closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on
par with much larger ones.

TL;DR: KoLasSimpleQA是首个评估大语言模型多语言事实能力的基准，涵盖9种语言和双领域设计，揭示模型性能差异并指导优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏针对大语言模型多语言事实能力的系统评估，KoLasSimpleQA旨在填补这一空白，支持全球适用性和多语言能力的全面评估。

Method: 构建具有单知识点覆盖、绝对客观性、唯一答案和时间稳定性的问题集，采用LLM-as-judge范式，评估模型的事实记忆和自我认知能力。

Result: 主流大语言模型在通用领域和语言特定领域表现差异显著，尤其在性能指标、排名、校准和鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: KoLasSimpleQA有助于识别大语言模型在多语言环境中的能力边界，并为模型优化提供指导。

Abstract: We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual
factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research,
we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point
coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These
questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing
both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know").
KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth
(Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global
applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the
general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as
history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of
multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional
LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance
differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics,
ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted
evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA
will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in
multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will
release KoLasSimpleQA at https://github.com/opendatalab/KoLasSimpleQA .

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了立场与媒体框架在气候变化网络迷因中的交互作用，创建了首个标注立场和媒体框架的数据集CLIMATEMEMES，并评估了视觉语言模型和大型语言模型在立场检测和媒体框架检测任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 媒体框架通过强调特定方面来塑造公众对问题的理解和看法，但其与立场的交互作用尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，特别是在气候变化网络迷因的背景下。

Method: 研究采用跨学科方法，构建了包含1,184个迷因的数据集CLIMATEMEMES，标注了立场和媒体框架。评估了LLaVA-NeXT和Molmo等模型在不同设置下的表现，包括使用人工标注、合成标注和OCR校正后的文本。

Result: 视觉语言模型在立场检测上表现良好，但在媒体框架检测上表现不佳，大型语言模型在此任务上优于视觉语言模型。人工标注能持续提升性能，合成标注和OCR校正文本偶尔也有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型在处理气候变化网络迷因中细微框架和立场表达时的局限性，强调了大型语言模型在媒体框架检测任务上的优势。

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality
to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to
shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and
stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to
conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes
on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change
memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in
communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47
subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities,
and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We
propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame
detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the
corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently
enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help
occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but
struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs'
limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change
internet memes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自我进化框架，通过两阶段优化LLM的情感支持能力，使其生成更个性化的回应，减少无用回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在情感支持中常提供通用回应，无法满足用户个性化需求，需改进以更好地理解用户隐含偏好。

Method: 框架分为两阶段：1) 基础情感支持微调；2) 通过自我反思和优化生成个性化回应，并迭代优化偏好对齐。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升模型情感支持性能，减少无用回复并缩小用户偏好与模型输出的差距。

Conclusion: 自我进化框架有效提升LLM情感支持的个性化能力，使其更贴合用户实际需求。

Abstract: Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs
to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often
deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users'
specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework
designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users'
implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional
states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases:
\textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are
fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic
support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional
Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate
personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization
between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that
reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive
experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances
the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and
minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型的高质量机器翻译系统能够生成反映特定风格约束的个性化翻译，但在风格要求不太明确或难以通过提示传达的情况下，这些系统仍面临挑战。论文旨在探索如何在低资源设置下实现个性化翻译。

Method: 论文研究了提示策略和推理时干预方法，以引导模型生成个性化风格的翻译，并提出了一种利用稀疏自编码器提取的潜在概念的对比框架，以识别关键的个性化特性。

Result: 研究结果表明，引导方法在保持翻译质量的同时实现了强个性化。进一步分析发现，多示例提示和引导方法对模型层的影响相似，表明它们可能具有相似的作用机制。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在低资源环境下有效实现了个性化翻译，同时保持了翻译质量，为个性化机器翻译提供了新的思路。

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting
specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in
settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to
convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing
LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the
challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and
inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a
personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent
concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization
properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization
while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering
on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for
personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering
method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSR的自奖励强化学习框架，用于机器翻译任务，无需外部监督信号，仅依赖自判断奖励，取得了优于现有模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的机器翻译专用大语言模型（LLMs）严重依赖昂贵且难以扩展的外部监督信号（如人工标注的参考数据或训练好的奖励模型）。为了克服这一限制，作者提出了一种无需参考、完全在线且仅依赖自判断奖励的简单自奖励（SSR）强化学习框架。

Method: 作者提出了Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL)框架，该框架无需外部参考数据，完全在线，仅依赖自判断奖励。训练时使用了13K单语示例和Qwen-2.5-7B作为骨干模型。此外，还通过结合COMET的外部监督信号进一步增强了模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSR-Zero-7B在WMT23、WMT24和Flores200基准测试中的英汉互译任务上，表现优于现有的机器翻译专用LLMs（如TowerInstruct-13B和GemmaX-28-9B）以及更大的通用LLMs（如Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct）。结合COMET的SSR-X-Zero-7B模型在英汉互译任务上达到了最先进的性能，超越了所有72B参数以下的开源模型，甚至优于闭源模型如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 论文证明了自奖励机制在机器翻译中的有效性，并展示了其与训练好的奖励模型结合时的互补优势。研究结果为自改进强化学习方法的潜力提供了有价值的见解。作者已公开了代码、数据和模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

Abstract: Empowered by vast internal knowledge reservoir, the new generation of large

However, there is insufficient effort made towards summoning up a synergic
effect from multiple LLMs' expertise and background. In this study, we propose
a multi-LLM collaboration framework tailored on a medical multiple-choice
questions dataset. Through post-hoc analysis on 3 pre-trained LLM participants,
our framework is proved to boost all LLMs reasoning ability as well as
alleviate their divergence among questions. We also measure an LLM's confidence
when it confronts with adversary opinions from other LLMs and observe a
concurrence between LLM's confidence and prediction accuracy.

Motivation: 针对中国古代数学经典智能处理的挑战，研究旨在通过构建基准数据集，系统评估推理模型在文言文独特语言约束下的数学问题解决能力。

Method: 通过机器辅助标注与人工校验，从8部典籍提取538道数学问题，构建以'问-答-解'为核心的结构化数据集，并设计闭卷与开卷双评估模式测试6种推理模型。

Result: 推理模型能部分理解并解决古文数学问题，但整体表现低于现代数学任务基准，尤其在开卷模式下再现古典解法时表现欠佳。

Conclusion: 提升模型的文言文理解与文化知识是优化重点，该研究为古籍数学知识挖掘与传统文化传播提供方法论支持，并为评估模型的跨语言文化能力提供新视角。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese
ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for
evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical
field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese
pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on
national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual
synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to
assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model
against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o.
Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models
and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on
terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o
performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency
reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader
diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical
variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese
domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for
future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and
datasets are released at https://github.com/EQUES-Inc/pharma-LLM-eval.

Motivation: 现有研究仅通过归纳头解释上下文学习（ICL），但无法解释模型如何从上下文中学习解决任务而非简单复制答案。本文旨在探索这种元学习能力的训练动态。

Method: 扩展了先前研究的复制任务，构建了上下文元学习场景，分析模型电路在训练过程中的动态变化。

Result: 发现元学习能力通过多阶段电路形成获得，每个阶段出现独特电路结构，不同于归纳头的单阶段变化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer获得ICL能力的多阶段机制，为理解大语言模型的元学习能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where
predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links
induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account
for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important
property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn
how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context;
how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this
paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by
analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we
extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning
setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the
process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each
phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The
emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large
language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source
of the transformer's ICL ability.

TL;DR: 提出Locate-then-Merge框架和Neuron-Fusion策略，解决MLLMs在多模态指令调优中的语言能力遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型在指令调优阶段常导致基础语言能力退化，即使如Llama3等强模型也存在此问题。

Method: 采用无训练参数融合框架，先定位重要参数再选择性合并，并通过神经元级策略保留视觉能力相关参数。

Result: 在13个语言和视觉任务基准测试中优于现有模型融合方法，有效减少生成中的上下文幻觉。

Conclusion: Neuron-Fusion方法在保持视觉适应能力的同时显著缓解了语言能力退化问题。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic
forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like
Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free
parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then
selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level
strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter
shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual
capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes
that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better
retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation.
Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that
Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further
analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in
generation.

Detoxification", a cross-lingual paradigm that mitigates toxicity, enabling
detoxification capabilities to transfer between high and low-resource languages
across different script families. We analyze cross-lingual detoxification's
effectiveness through 504 extensive settings to evaluate toxicity reduction in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIM提出了一种针对LLM的细粒度剪枝方法，通过逐维度调整稀疏度，显著提升了高稀疏率下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一步剪枝方法通常在各层或层内采用统一稀疏度，导致在高稀疏率下性能不佳。

Method: TRIM采用基于质量指标的迭代调整过程，优化各输出维度（行）的稀疏度分配，减少输出质量保留的方差。

Result: 在多种LLM和稀疏度水平上，TRIM实现了新的最先进结果，如在80%稀疏度下，显著降低了困惑度。

Conclusion: 细粒度的逐维度稀疏度调整对于推动LLM极限压缩至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory
challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their
efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform
sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in
suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work
introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel
approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions
(rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided
by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on
reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical
information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning
strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse
LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that
TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For
instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and

### [101] [IFEval-Audio: Benchmarking Instruction-Following Capability in Audio-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16774)
*Yiming Gao,Bin Wang,Chengwei Wei,Shuo Sun,AiTi Aw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了IFEval-Audio数据集，用于评估音频大语言模型在遵循指令方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本任务中表现出强大的指令遵循能力，但在与图像或音频等非文本模态对齐后，这种能力往往会下降。目前关于音频大语言模型指令遵循能力的研究较少，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 作者引入IFEval-Audio数据集，包含280个音频-指令-答案三元组，覆盖六个维度：内容、大写、符号、列表结构、长度和格式。每个例子将音频输入与文本指令配对，要求模型生成符合特定结构的输出。

Result: 论文对当前最先进的音频大语言模型进行了基准测试，评估它们在遵循涉及音频指令方面的能力。

Conclusion: IFEval-Audio数据集的发布将支持这一新兴领域的未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following
capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in
multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or
audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following
performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in
audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess
the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280
audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content,
Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs
an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an
output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio
LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is
released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM潜在推理领域提供了结构化基础，相关论文资源将持续更新于GitHub仓库。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional
CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language,
introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract
reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent
CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling
reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive
representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored
various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies,
structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents
a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by
proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies,
internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth
discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting
their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a
structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning.

Method: 通过分析微调数据的语言特征、语义相似性和毒性等关联因素，评估模型对抗性能，并探究数据集因素与攻击成功率的关系。

Result: 揭示了微调数据特性与对抗攻击漏洞之间的潜在因果关系，为防御策略提供新见解。

Conclusion: 强调数据集设计对保持模型对齐的关键作用，需在微调过程中谨慎选择数据以避免意外漏洞。

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific
datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce
vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate
Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from
characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential
correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and
toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial
performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate
with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering
new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial
role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at

obtained through a common documentary process to enhance model generalization.
To further address data scarcity, we integrate synthetic training data
generated by large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型多步推理任务中面临证据提取和利用的挑战，现有方法常提取语义相关但逻辑无关的证据，导致推理错误。

Method: 提出TW-ESA模块通过严格推理与LLM推理的双向对齐增强证据因果逻辑理解，DGR模块通过双门控机制逐步融合LLM内在知识提升推理准确性。

Result: 在三个KIMSR数据集上，ESA-DGR框架显著优于现有方法，EM和F1分数分别平均提升4%和5%。

Conclusion: ESA-DGR框架通过协同训练TW-ESA和DGR模块，有效提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in knowledge-intensive
multi-step reasoning (KIMSR) tasks. One challenge is how to effectively extract
and represent rationale evidence. The current methods often extract
semantically relevant but logically irrelevant evidence, resulting in flawed
reasoning and inaccurate responses. We propose a two-way evidence
self-alignment (TW-ESA) module, which utilizes the mutual alignment between
strict reasoning and LLM reasoning to enhance its understanding of the causal
logic of evidence, thereby addressing the first challenge. Another challenge is
how to utilize the rationale evidence and LLM's intrinsic knowledge for
accurate reasoning when the evidence contains uncertainty. We propose a
dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module to gradually fuse useful
knowledge of LLM within strict reasoning, which can enable the model to perform
accurate reasoning by focusing on causal elements in the evidence and exhibit
greater robustness. The two modules are collaboratively trained in a unified
framework ESA-DGR. Extensive experiments on three diverse and challenging KIMSR
datasets reveal that ESA-DGR significantly surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-based
fine-tuning methods, with remarkable average improvements of 4% in exact match
(EM) and 5% in F1 score. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了合成数据在低资源语言命名实体识别中的作用，覆盖11种语言，结果显示合成数据有潜力但效果因语言而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言由于标注数据有限，命名实体识别(NER)面临挑战。数据增强是常用方法，但合成数据在多语言低资源NER中的作用尚不明确。

Method: 通过在11种不同语系的低资源语言上实验，评估合成数据对NER性能的影响。

Result: 合成数据对低资源语言NER有积极作用，但不同语言间的效果差异显著。

Conclusion: 合成数据是低资源语言NER的有效补充手段，但需考虑语言特性对效果的调节作用。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition(NER) for low-resource languages aims to produce
robust systems for languages where there is limited labeled training data
available, and has been an area of increasing interest within NLP. Data
augmentation for increasing the amount of low-resource labeled data is a common
practice. In this paper, we explore the role of synthetic data in the context
of multilingual, low-resource NER, considering 11 languages from diverse
language families. Our results suggest that synthetic data does in fact hold
promise for low-resource language NER, though we see significant variation
between languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型(LLM)的遗忘评估依赖词级指标可能产生误导，研究发现遗忘可能只是掩盖而非真正删除信息。论文提出基于表示层的评估框架，揭示了可逆与不可逆遗忘的关键区别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘评估过度依赖词级指标(如准确率、困惑度)，但这些指标可能产生误导性结果，无法反映模型是否真正删除了信息。需要开发更可靠的表示层评估方法。

Method: 提出基于PCA相似性/偏移、中心核对齐和Fisher信息的表示层评估框架，在6种遗忘方法、3个领域和2个开源LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 发现可逆遗忘(词级崩溃但保留潜在特征)与不可逆遗忘(表示层深度损坏)的关键区别，证明浅层权重扰动会导致误导性遗忘信号，且可逆性受任务类型和超参数调节。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在根本缺陷，提出的表示层分析工具为LLM可信遗忘建立了新的诊断基础，揭示了遗忘机制的本质特征。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the
influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level
metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be
misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be
rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may
obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we
introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based
similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.
Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code,
math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between
reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer
token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper
representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account
linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading
unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and
hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation
practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning
in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes
under unlearning and relearning:

Motivation: 现有RAG系统在复杂深度搜索场景中面临高质量训练轨迹缺乏、模拟环境分布不匹配及计算成本高昂的问题。

Method: 通过模拟真实用户交互生成高质量训练数据，并采用多标准筛选策略优化输入输出多样性及质量，实现轻量级有效训练。

Result: 在五个跨领域基准测试中，仅用871个精选样本的监督微调（SFT）显著优于基于强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究通过系统性解决数据稀缺瓶颈，证实了SFT作为高效深度搜索系统可行路径的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language
models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical
limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the
distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive
computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces
SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap
through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our
approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user
interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria
curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output
side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that
SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based
baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically
addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for
efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R1-Compress是一种两阶段分块压缩框架，旨在减少长链式思考（Long-CoT）的令牌使用量，同时保持推理准确性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法（实例级和令牌级）要么牺牲关键局部推理信号，要么导致输出不连贯。为解决这些问题，提出了R1-Compress。

Method: R1-Compress将Long-CoT分割为可管理的块，应用LLM驱动的块内压缩，并通过块间搜索机制选择简短且连贯的序列。

Result: 在MATH500等数据集上，R1-Compress显著减少令牌使用量（约20%），同时保持高推理准确率（92.4%）。

Conclusion: R1-Compress有效平衡了压缩效率和推理性能，为长链式思考提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces
substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing
compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice
essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs.
To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level
compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our
method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk
compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short
and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500,
AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces
token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500,
R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to
the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%. Source code

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for detecting inappropriately targeting
language in online conversations by integrating crowd and expert annotations
with ChatGPT. We focus on English conversation threads from Reddit, examining
comments that target individuals or groups. Our approach involves a
comprehensive annotation framework that labels a diverse data set for various
target categories and specific target words within the conversational context.
We perform a comparative analysis of annotations from human experts, crowd
annotators, and ChatGPT, revealing strengths and limitations of each method in
recognizing both explicit hate speech and subtler discriminatory language. Our
findings highlight the significant role of contextual factors in identifying
hate speech and uncover new categories of targeting, such as social belief and
body image. We also address the challenges and subjective judgments involved in
annotation and the limitations of ChatGPT in grasping nuanced language. This
study provides insights for improving automated content moderation strategies

Conclusion: 子词标记化技术对机器翻译性能有显著影响，选择合适的技术取决于具体应用场景。SentencePiece和BPE在不同模型中各有优势，适用于不同需求。

Abstract: Tokenization is the act of breaking down text into smaller parts, or tokens,
that are easier for machines to process. This is a key phase in machine
translation (MT) models. Subword tokenization enhances this process by breaking
down words into smaller subword units, which is especially beneficial in
languages with complicated morphology or a vast vocabulary. It is useful in
capturing the intricate structure of words in Indian languages (ILs), such as
prefixes, suffixes, and other morphological variations. These languages
frequently use agglutinative structures, in which words are formed by the
combination of multiple morphemes such as suffixes, prefixes, and stems. As a
result, a suitable tokenization strategy must be chosen to address these
scenarios. This paper examines how different subword tokenization techniques,
such as SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece Tokenization,
affect ILs. The effectiveness of these subword tokenization techniques is
investigated in statistical, neural, and multilingual neural machine
translation models. All models are examined using standard evaluation metrics,
such as the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, TER, METEOR, CHRF,
RIBES, and COMET. Based on the results, it appears that for the majority of
language pairs for the Statistical and Neural MT models, the SentencePiece
tokenizer continuously performed better than other tokenizers in terms of BLEU
score. However, BPE tokenization outperformed other tokenization techniques in
the context of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model. The results show
that, despite using the same tokenizer and dataset for each model, translations
from ILs to English surpassed translations from English to ILs.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如RLHF和DPO）主要针对单语言，难以处理多语言噪声数据，亟需改进多语言安全对齐能力。

Method: 提出MPO方法，通过最小化主导语言（英语）与目标语言的奖励差距，实现安全能力的跨语言迁移。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1、Gemma-2和Qwen2.5三个模型上的实验表明，MPO能有效提升多语言安全对齐且不影响通用多语言能力。

Conclusion: MPO为多语言模型的安全对齐提供了高效解决方案，成功实现安全能力的跨语言迁移。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI
applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to
ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing
preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are
primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address
these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a
novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the
dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple
languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the
dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety
capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language.
Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate
MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general
multilingual utility.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CASTILLO数据集，用于分析不同LLM生成文本长度的变异性，以优化资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)推理时资源管理困难，因文本生成长度具有随机性和变异性，现有方法存在偏差或忽略模型及提示的差异性。

Method: 构建CASTILLO数据集，涵盖13种开源LLM在7种指令遵循语料上的响应长度分布，记录生成设置及统计指标。

Result: 发现响应长度存在显著模型间/内差异，部分文本退化现象，并揭示了模型特定生成行为。

Conclusion: CASTILLO为预测模型开发提供基础，促进生成语言模型与系统研究的交叉发展。

Abstract: Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable
lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response
lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing
approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on
assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce
CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13
widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following
corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10
independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token
length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev,
percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact
generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model
variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as
well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration
in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive
models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for
analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset
and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling
and systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地探讨了大语言模型(LLM)幻觉现象与上下文注入导致的内部状态漂移之间的关系，揭示了幻觉产生和固化的关键机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉（看似合理但错误的输出）是大语言模型可靠部署的主要障碍。研究旨在揭示上下文增量注入如何通过内部状态漂移诱发幻觉，为预测和缓解提供理论基础。

Method: 使用TruthfulQA构建16轮'滴定'实验轨道（相关但有缺陷内容 vs 误导性内容），通过三视角检测器追踪显性幻觉率，并采用余弦相似度、熵、JS散度和Spearman相关系数分析隐藏状态/注意力图的隐性漂移。

Result: 发现：(1)幻觉频率与表征漂移呈单调增长关系，5-7轮后趋于稳定；(2)相关上下文导致高置信度的'自洽'幻觉，无关上下文引发注意力重路由的主题漂移错误；(3)JS漂移(~0.69)和Spearman漂移(~0)的收敛标志'注意力锁定'阈值。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了幻觉固化的内在机制，证明同化能力与注意力扩散间的此消彼长关系，为基于内在状态的幻觉预测和上下文感知缓解提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical
barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the
first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift
induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two
16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially
flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six
open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective
detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of
hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of
hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7
rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing
high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context
induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3)
convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an
"attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become
resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between
assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error
modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination
prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

### [116] [Power-Law Decay Loss for Large Language Model Finetuning: Focusing on Information Sparsity to Enhance Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16900)
*Jintian Shao,Hongyi Huang,Jiayi Wu,Beiwen Zhang,ZhiYu Wu,You Shan,MingKai Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的损失函数PDL，通过根据词频重新加权标准交叉熵损失中的每个词元，优化文本生成任务的微调过程，以提高生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本生成任务的微调阶段，标准的交叉熵损失平等对待所有词元，导致模型可能过度强调高频但信息量低的词元，而忽略了低频但对生成内容的特异性和信息量至关重要的词元。

Method: 本文引入了Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL)，这是一种新颖的损失函数，它基于训练语料中词元的频率，按照幂律衰减重新加权标准交叉熵损失中每个词元的贡献。具体来说，高频词元的权重被降低，而低频、信息密集的词元被赋予更高的权重。

Result: PDL机制引导模型在微调过程中更多地学习和生成传达特定和独特信息的词元，从而提高了生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量。

Conclusion: PDL在抽象摘要、对话系统和风格转换等多种文本生成微调任务中具有潜在的应用和优势，能够有效提升生成内容的信息量和特异性。

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy
loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize
high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens
crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper
introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically
designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core
motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and
linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to
its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in
the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus,
following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency
tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned
higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more
on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information,
thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated
text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and
discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text
generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue
systems, and style transfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出UNCLE基准，评估大语言模型在长短问答中表达不确定性的能力，发现当前模型在长文本生成中表现不佳，并通过训练方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成长文本时容易产生幻觉，现有研究缺乏对其在长文本中表达不确定性能力的直接评估。

Method: 引入UNCLE基准，包含长短问答数据集，并提出新指标评估模型选择性表达不确定性的能力。

Result: 当前模型在长文本生成中未能恰当表达不确定性，训练方法比提示方法更有效提升性能。

Conclusion: UNCLE基准为未来研究提供了方向，揭示了长短文本不确定性表达的差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in
long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to
teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient
knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs'
ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address
this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate
uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA).
UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k
short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and
long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the
benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities
to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that
current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form
generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to
improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater
gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form
uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research
using UNCLE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自动化方法，通过自校正设置挖掘语言模型中的潜在行为属性，并压缩为可解释的原则集，以提升模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要人工标注大量行为准则，耗时耗力。论文旨在自动化这一过程，通过模型自身挖掘潜在属性，减少人工干预。

Method: 采用后验正则化的蒙特卡洛期望最大化方法，挖掘并压缩潜在原则，教导模型策略性地调用这些原则以优化生成结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法使较小语言模型（7-8B参数）在AlpacaEval胜率提升8-10%，MT-Bench平均提升0.3分，IFEval原则遵循胜率提升19-23%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化原则驱动后训练在持续自我改进中的潜力，同时保持了模型性能的可解释性和多样性。

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations,
it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should
strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even
non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate
this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model
reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a
self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself
and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering.
Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo
Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective
latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to
intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our
algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B
parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an
average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on
IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and
diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The
gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated,
principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人身份信息(PII)匿名化是开放科学数据共享的重要障碍，现有方法的错误率和召回率/精确度权衡限制了其应用。

Method: 提出轻量级框架PIIvot，利用数据上下文知识简化PII检测问题。

Result: 开发了PIIvot框架，并贡献了当前最大的开源教育对话数据集QATD-2k。

Conclusion: PIIvot框架有效简化PII匿名化流程，QATD-2k数据集有助于推动教育对话研究。

Abstract: Personally identifiable information (PII) anonymization is a high-stakes task
that poses a barrier to many open-science data sharing initiatives. While PII
identification has made large strides in recent years, in practice, error
thresholds and the recall/precision trade-off still limit the uptake of these
anonymization pipelines. We present PIIvot, a lighter-weight framework for PII
anonymization that leverages knowledge of the data context to simplify the PII
detection problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we also contribute
QATD-2k, the largest open-source real-world tutoring dataset of its kind, to
support the demand for quality educational dialogue data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为In-Context Watermarking (ICW)的新型水印技术，通过提示工程在LLM生成的文本中嵌入水印，无需访问解码过程，适用于实际场景如学术评审中的AI文本检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型(LLMs)在敏感应用中的广泛使用，确保AI生成文本的来源和可追溯性变得尤为重要。现有水印技术大多需要访问解码过程，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了In-Context Watermarking (ICW)方法，通过提示工程利用LLM的上下文学习和指令遵循能力嵌入水印，研究了四种不同粒度的ICW策略及相应的检测方法，并探讨了间接提示注入(IPI)作为具体案例。

Result: 实验验证了ICW作为一种模型无关的实用水印方法的可行性，并表明随着LLM能力的提升，ICW为可扩展和易访问的内容溯源提供了有前景的方向。

Conclusion: ICW通过提示工程实现水印嵌入，为AI生成文本的溯源提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，尤其在学术评审等实际场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications
has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the
provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing
watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their
applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of
LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where
conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect
AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context
Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through
prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and
instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at
different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method.
We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific
case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input
documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the
feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach.
Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a
promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、截断和词汇表修剪的方法，用于极端压缩多语言编码器模型，特别针对低资源语言，实现了高达92%的压缩率，性能损失仅为2-10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低资源语言的多语言模型压缩需求，本文旨在通过系统结合现有技术，显著减小模型体积，同时保留关键语言知识。

Method: 采用两步知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝、截断和词汇表修剪，压缩层深度、前馈隐藏层大小和中间层嵌入尺寸。

Result: 在四种下游任务（情感分析、主题分类、命名实体识别和词性标注）中，压缩率高达92%，性能损失仅为2-10%，且性能下降与教师模型中语言特定数据量相关。

Conclusion: 该方法有效压缩多语言模型，尤其适用于低资源语言，并通过消融研究验证了最佳实践。

Abstract: In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured
pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing
multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel
approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the
extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer
embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while
retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates
of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in four downstream
tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity
recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages.
Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of
language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in
smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
to identify best practices for multilingual model compression using these
techniques.

Motivation: 基于句子语义的文本分割是许多下游应用的基础任务，需要同时考虑局部连贯性和远距离语义相似性。

Method: 采用基于图模型的非监督学习方法BP-Seg，通过信念传播在精心构建的图模型上实现文本分割。

Result: 在示例和长文档数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他竞争方法。

Conclusion: BP-Seg方法能有效实现文本分割，在局部连贯性和远距离语义分组上表现优异。

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental
task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we
propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg
for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence,
capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but
also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically
similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully
constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative
example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method
performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Speech Back-Translation的可扩展方法，通过将大规模文本语料库转换为合成语音来提升多语言ASR模型的性能，显著降低了转录错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动语音识别（ASR）的进步主要依赖大规模语音语料库，但在资源有限的语言中扩展覆盖范围仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用现成的文本转语音（TTS）模型，将大规模文本语料库转换为合成语音，并通过基于可懂度的评估框架确保合成语音质量。

Result: 在十种语言中生成了超过50万小时的合成语音，继续预训练Whisper-large-v3模型，平均转录错误率降低了30%以上。

Conclusion: Speech Back-Translation方法展示了其在增强多语言ASR系统方面的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely
fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse
languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper
introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves
multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic
speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just
tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to
generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while
maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an
intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for
when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we
generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and
continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error
reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and
effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriFastScore通过微调Llama3.1 8B模型，实现了快速提取和验证文本中的可验证声明，速度提升6.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长文本事实性评估方法（如FactScore和VeriScore）虽然有效，但由于需要分解和验证每个原子声明，导致计算成本高、耗时长，限制了其在大规模评估和训练场景中的实用性。

Method: 提出VeriFastScore，利用合成数据微调Llama3.1 8B模型，基于Google搜索的证据同时提取和验证文本中的所有可验证声明。

Result: VeriFastScore在示例级别（r=0.80）和系统级别（r=0.94）上与原始VeriScore流程强相关，总体速度提升6.6倍（排除证据检索时为9.9倍）。

Conclusion: VeriFastScore显著提升了长文本事实性评估的效率，同时保持了高准确性，为未来的事实性研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality
operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then
individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these
methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to
evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale
evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore,
which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously
extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on
evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via
few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives
~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims,
judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our
fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the
original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level
(r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence
retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we
publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法将LLM适配到流式处理时，要么依赖昂贵的重编码，要么使用可扩展性有限的专用架构。论文旨在解决批处理LLM在流式场景中的三个关键不匹配问题。

Method: 引入基于批处理架构的组位置编码范式，增强流式与批处理模式间的一致性，无需修改模型架构。

Conclusion: 通过保留源和目标上下文中的相对位置而非绝对顺序，该方法有效解决了流式LLM适配问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing.
Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive
re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work
identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming:
(1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches.
While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent
re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch
significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely
unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption,
we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding
on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source
and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated
by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on
batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes.
Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no
architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming
and batch modes. The code is available at repository

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective
planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool
calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge.
To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,
tool-dependent scenarios.

comprehensive, and research-friendly codebase for LLM-based MAS. (1) MASLab
integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously
validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation.
(2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair
comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized
evaluation protocols. (3) MASLab implements methods within a shared streamlined
structure, lowering the barriers for understanding and extension. Building on
MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感支持对话模型存在心理学错误，且直接偏好优化方法因数据纠缠和优化模糊性问题效果受限。

Method: 提出IPM方法构建IPM-PrefDial数据集，基于Gross情绪调节模型将任务解耦为策略规划和共情生成两个子任务，分别用SFT和DPO优化。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于联合优化基线，减少了偏好偏差并提高了响应质量。

Conclusion: 解耦框架有效解决了数据纠缠问题，DPO分步优化显著提升了情感支持对话的心理学合理性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved
emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still
persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing
such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC
tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing
ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content,
making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2)
Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data
leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce
Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data,
forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a
Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion
Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks:
strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT
and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms
joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response
quality.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注用形式语言引导LLMs生成可靠推理路径，但缺乏对这些能力的系统性评估。本文旨在填补这一空白，全面评估LLMs在不同逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Method: 从LLM谱系、任务分类和轨迹格式三个维度出发，使用形式语言对多种逻辑推理问题进行评估，并通过形式相关训练数据增强小语言模型。

Result: 1) 思维模型表现优于指令模型；2) 所有LLMs在归纳推理上表现有限；3) PoT格式数据泛化性能最佳。实验还表明，简单的拒绝微调方法能提升模型跨形式语言的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 形式语言能显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力，但归纳推理仍是挑战。PoT格式数据和拒绝微调方法是提升性能的有效手段。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough
performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing
research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable
reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still
limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs
across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the
perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and
format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly
outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All
LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of
whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best
generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate
the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models,
and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method
can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the
best overall performance. Our codes and reports are available at

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) SFT冷启动学习基础格式；2) RL阶段通过结果监督鼓励探索，结合奖励机制利用内部知识，并通过记忆机制持续吸收外部信息。

Result: 实验表明R1-Searcher++优于现有RAG和推理方法，实现了高效检索。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态结合内外知识源，持续提升模型能力，为检索增强推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to
static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting
external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,
or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce
R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage
both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage
training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format
learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses
outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism
for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to
continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's
internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search
engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++
outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient
retrieval. The code is available at

*Long Wanga,Jiongzhi Zheng,Zhengda Xiong,ChuMin Li,Kun He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择候选边的改进LKH算法，通过多臂老虎机模型提升TSP求解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由算法（如LKH）使用静态候选边，易陷入局部最优，限制了求解质量。

Method: 引入多臂老虎机模型动态选择候选边，扩展候选集以包含更有潜力的边。

Result: 在多个TSP基准测试中表现优异，且能显著提升LKH-3在各类TSP变体问题中的性能。

Conclusion: 动态候选边选择策略有效提升了传统算法的全局搜索能力。

Abstract: Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality
candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and
enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the
classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static
throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get
trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To
address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other
promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we
incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable
candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and
lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks
show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this
bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various
TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's
performance across typical TSP variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出首个大规模物理推理基准PhyX，评估模型在视觉场景中的物理推理能力，发现当前顶尖模型表现远逊于人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能涵盖物理推理这一关键智能维度——即整合领域知识、符号推理与真实世界约束理解的能力。

Method: 构建包含3K多模态问题的PhyX基准，覆盖6类推理和25个子领域，基于VLMEvalKit实现一键式评估协议。

Result: GPT-4o等顶尖模型准确率仅32.5%-45.8%，较人类专家差距超29%，暴露依赖记忆、公式和表面模式匹配的缺陷。

Conclusion: 当前模型缺乏真正的物理理解，需通过细粒度统计、案例研究和多范式评估来推进物理推理能力研究。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence:
physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge,
symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address
this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess
models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX
includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning
types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics,
electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In
our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle
significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy
respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our
analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on
memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical
formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine
physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained
statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to
thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility,
we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits
such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用好奇心驱动AI科学家自动发现Flow-Lenia系统级动力学的方法，旨在揭示连续细胞自动机中自组织演化和生态系统动力学的形成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是扩展以往在Lenia中寻找自组织个体模式的工作，探索更大环境中不同交互模式的自组织行为，以理解复杂系统中涌现的集体特性。

Method: 方法包括采用内在动机目标探索过程（IMGEPs），结合模拟范围指标（如进化活性、基于压缩的复杂性和多尺度熵）来驱动Flow-Lenia环境的多样化探索。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法比随机搜索能发现更多样化的动力学行为，并展示了生态系统模拟如何自组织出复杂集体行为，这些行为是以往个体模式搜索未能捕捉的。

Conclusion: 尽管以Flow-Lenia为例，该方法为理解其他参数化复杂系统中涌现的集体特性提供了一个潜在适用的框架，并通过交互式探索工具实现了高效的人机协作科研流程。

Abstract: We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in
Flow-Lenia$-$a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and
parameter localization$-$using a curiosity-driven AI scientist. This method
aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and
ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity
search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and
extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We
adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive
exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics,
such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale
entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to
illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We
show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable
self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous
individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with
an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative
workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with
Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to
other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective
properties is of interest.

TL;DR: 研究探讨儿童对AI推理过程的理解，发现不同年龄段儿童对AI推理的认知模型存在差异，并提出了AI教育中的三个关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI推理能力的提升，尤其是大型推理模型（LRMs）的出现，了解儿童如何理解AI的推理过程对于培养AI素养至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先与8名儿童进行共同设计会议，随后对106名3-8年级儿童进行实地研究。

Result: 研究发现儿童对AI推理有三种模型：演绎、归纳和固有模型。年幼儿童（3-5年级）倾向于认为AI推理源于固有智能，而年长儿童（6-8年级）则视AI为模式识别器。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童理解AI推理过程中的三个关键问题，并提出了对AI课程设计和可解释AI工具开发的启示。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances in reasoning capabilities, most
recently with the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), understanding how
children conceptualize AI's reasoning processes becomes critical for fostering
AI literacy. While one of the "Five Big Ideas" in AI education highlights
reasoning algorithms as central to AI decision-making, less is known about
children's mental models in this area. Through a two-phase approach, consisting
of a co-design session with 8 children followed by a field study with 106
children (grades 3-8), we identified three models of AI reasoning: Deductive,
Inductive, and Inherent. Our findings reveal that younger children (grades 3-5)
often attribute AI's reasoning to inherent intelligence, while older children
(grades 6-8) recognize AI as a pattern recognizer. We highlight three tensions
that surfaced in children's understanding of AI reasoning and conclude with
implications for scaffolding AI curricula and designing explainable AI tools.

*Asterios Tsiourvas,Wei Sun,Georgia Perakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于因果端到端框架的LLM路由策略，通过最小化决策后悔值从观察数据中学习，避免了传统方法中的误差累积和高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM路由方法采用解耦策略，先预测性能指标再选择模型，容易导致误差累积且依赖高成本的全反馈数据。本文旨在通过观察数据学习路由策略，降低实践中的成本并提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种因果端到端框架，引入两种理论支持的代理目标：基于分类的上界和softmax加权的后悔近似，并通过区间条件架构处理异构成本偏好。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，实现了不同嵌入模型上的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过观察数据高效学习路由策略，显著提升了性能并降低了成本，为LLM路由提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query,
balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool
of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy,
where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on
these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on
full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models,
which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from
observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually
deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies
by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable
efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate
objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret
approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further
extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an
interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across different embedding models.

Conclusion: 该数据集为评估2D环境中的空间和物理推理能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology
optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a
design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are
provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and
must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset
includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within
partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these
tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material
distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or
explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural
stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of
spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a
complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结论指出，合理的内存管理设计能显著提升LLM智能体的长期性能，研究为构建鲁棒的记忆系统提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents,
enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance
over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory
management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term
performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that
are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new
experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past
experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through
our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an
experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the
input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent
outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated
with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences
compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay,
where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks.
Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and
deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an
average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth.
Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior
under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained
memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of
LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory
components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release
our code to facilitate further study.

Conclusion: SynEVO通过跨领域知识共享和模型进化，显著提升了时空系统的泛化能力，为NeuroAI的知识迁移和适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various
scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train
an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited
transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design
and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable
collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by
neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information
boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a
Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the
model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and
aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the
human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic
common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and
task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic
coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group
should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under
various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization
capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a
paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered
multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among
experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems
remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group
optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language
feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation
dimensions. We propose a two-step agent prompts optimization pipeline:
identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing
textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents
utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various
optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online
against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For
group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass
prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software
development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we
investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of
the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central
tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now
plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As
large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the
reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized,
high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into
numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity
searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to
misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial
contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday
language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous
language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently
embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and
industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to
interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from
the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie
Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's
ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment
analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the
analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market
sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.
Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis
results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate
alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed
across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the
greatest influence.

Result: 实验表明，通用大语言模型在零样本情况下表现有限，无法满足临床试验工作流程的高要求。

Conclusion: TrialPanorama数据库和基准任务的发布将促进临床试验AI的进一步研究。

Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid
data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce
TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical
trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key
aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions,
conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical
ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded
design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a
wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and
summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks
directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks
across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study
screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design,
eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial
completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some
zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes
clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark
to facilitate further research on AI for clinical trials.

Abstract: Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical
research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to
the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this
work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on
realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K
consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans,
curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and
reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a
structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed
in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or
more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While
these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard
statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along
four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and
conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of
the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable
hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or
refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world
science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating
generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped agent systems.
Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered
agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language
interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent
systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including
text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more
adaptive real-world behavior. This paper comprehensively examines the evolution
of agent systems from the pre-LLM era to current LLM-powered architectures. We
categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid
systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software
development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial
trading, and healthcare. We further discuss the primary challenges posed by
LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack
of evaluation metrics, and security vulnerabilities, and propose potential
solutions to mitigate these concerns.

*Jeffrey Seely,Yuki Imajuku,Tianyu Zhao,Edoardo Cetin,Llion Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Sudoku-Bench基准测试，通过独特数独变体评估大语言模型的创造性推理能力，现有模型仅能解决不到15%的谜题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准测试常依赖模式记忆而非真实创造力，需开发能评估多步骤创新逻辑推理的新方法。

Method: 构建包含挑战性数独变体的标准化测试集Sudoku-Bench，提供文本化表示工具和扩展框架。

Result: 实验显示最先进大语言模型在无辅助情况下解题成功率低于15%，暴露长程战略推理的不足。

Conclusion: 数独变体是理想的推理研究领域，该基准为推进创造性逻辑推理能力提供了可扩展平台。

Abstract: Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently
fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of
previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a
curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants
specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning.
Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each
puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization
infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs
(``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and
compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench
includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle
representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly
available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research
environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer
than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance
long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

*Le Ma,Shirao Yang,Zihao Wang,Yinggui Wang,Lei Wang,Tao Wei,Kejun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Unlearning Shapley框架，通过机器学习反学习高效估算数据价值，解决传统方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型的普及增加了对高效数据价值评估方法的需求，传统方法如基于博弈论的Shapley值和基于影响函数的技术计算成本高或需要完整数据和模型训练细节，难以实现部分数据估值。

Method: 利用机器学习反学习技术，从预训练模型中移除目标数据，并通过蒙特卡洛采样计算Shapley值，避免重新训练和依赖完整数据。

Result: 在基准数据集和大规模文本语料上的实验表明，该方法在保持与最先进方法相同准确性的同时，显著降低了计算开销。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了数据价值评估理论与实际应用之间的差距，为现代AI生态系统提供了一个可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data
valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers.
Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and
influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or
require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly
achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley,
a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values
efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring
performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values
via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on
full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data
valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for
data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora
demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods
while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis
confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of
data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work
bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment,
offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出SAI-DPO算法，通过动态选择训练数据来提升模型推理能力，相比静态数据选择方法显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖静态预定义指标（如难度和多样性），无法适应动态训练过程，尤其在线强化学习框架下表现不足。

Method: SAI-DPO算法实时评估模型在不同训练阶段的推理能力，动态调整数据选择策略以适应模型能力变化。

Result: 在8个数学推理基准测试中，SAI-DPO平均性能提升达21.3个百分点，在AIME24和AMC23上分别提升10和15分。

Conclusion: 动态自适应数据选择策略优于静态方法，能有效提升模型推理性能和数据利用效率。

Abstract: In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches
predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty
and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of
these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving
capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly
pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement
learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce
SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously
assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different
training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO
adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of
the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task
performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level
datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average
performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable
improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These
results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection
over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出SafeKey方法，通过激活安全推理的'aha时刻'来提升大型推理模型对未知越狱提示的安全泛化能力，平均降低9.6%的有害响应率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但对有害查询和对抗攻击存在安全隐患。监督微调（SFT）方法虽能提升安全性，但难以泛化到未见过的越狱提示。

Method: 提出SafeKey方法，包含两个目标：(1) 双路径安全头增强关键句前的安全信号，(2) 查询掩码建模目标提升模型对查询理解的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，SafeKey显著提升模型对越狱攻击和分布外有害提示的安全泛化能力，平均降低9.6%的有害率，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SafeKey通过重塑内部注意力和提升隐藏表示质量，有效增强模型安全性，为LRMs的安全防护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of
explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in
complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries
and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that
SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After
thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment
that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment
typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query
understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely.
Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary
objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a
Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal
representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling
objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which
has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a
wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts,
lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general
abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping
internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的方法，利用离散事件数据补全多智能体系统中的速度信息，以提升团队运动分析的深度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实复杂系统中的多智能体行为通常表现为离散事件数据，但这类数据缺乏连续时间信息，难以直接计算速度等关键动态属性，从而限制了动态分析和团队策略理解的深度。

Method: 论文提出了一种新方法，仅利用团队运动的离散事件位置数据，同时补全所有智能体的速度信息，并基于此研究现有团队运动分析与评估方法的适用性。

Result: 实验表明，基于神经网络的方法在速度补全误差上优于基于规则的方法，且利用补全速度得到的空间评估结果更接近完整追踪数据的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了团队运动系统分析的潜力，尤其在处理时间依赖性和智能体间交互的图结构方面表现出色。

Abstract: In many real-world complex systems, the behavior can be observed as a
collection of discrete events generated by multiple interacting agents.
Analyzing the dynamics of these multi-agent systems, especially team sports,
often relies on understanding the movement and interactions of individual
agents. However, while providing valuable snapshots, event-based positional
data typically lacks the continuous temporal information needed to directly
calculate crucial properties such as velocity. This absence severely limits the
depth of dynamic analysis, preventing a comprehensive understanding of
individual agent behaviors and emergent team strategies. To address this
challenge, we propose a new method to simultaneously complete the velocity of
all agents using only the event-based positional data from team sports. Based
on this completed velocity information, we investigate the applicability of
existing team sports analysis and evaluation methods. Experiments using soccer
event data demonstrate that neural network-based approaches outperformed
rule-based methods regarding velocity completion error, considering the
underlying temporal dependencies and graph structure of player-to-player or
player-to-ball interaction. Moreover, the space evaluation results obtained
using the completed velocity are closer to those derived from complete tracking
data, highlighting our method's potential for enhanced team sports system
analysis.

TL;DR: LightRouter是一个新型框架，通过自适应选择和集成少量LLM来优化任务性能和成本效率，无需先验知识且仅依赖轻量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在性能和成本上差异显著，用户难以选择最适合特定任务的模型。

Method: LightRouter采用自适应选择机制减少启动标记数以降低成本，并通过有效集成策略结合模型输出。

Result: 实验表明，LightRouter在多个基准测试中匹配或超越主流集成方法，准确率提升25%，推理成本降低27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效LLM选择提供了实用方法，并为模型组合策略提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable
capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks.
However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost,
performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users
aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we
present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and
integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of
jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter
leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only
a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an
effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms
widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy.
Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable
performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our
framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies
exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a
practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights
into optimal strategies for model combination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的异常检测方法存在'超球体坍塌'问题，限制了模型的性能和适用性。MADCluster旨在通过自监督聚类解决这一问题，并兼容多种深度学习架构。

Method: MADCluster包含三个核心组件：基础嵌入器（捕获高维时间动态）、聚类距离映射和序列聚类（持续更新中心）。通过提出'单向自适应损失'优化聚类效果，并数学证明其优化过程。

Result: 在四个时间序列基准数据集上的实验表明，MADCluster显著提升了对比模型的整体性能，验证了其有效性和兼容性。

Conclusion: MADCluster的模型无关特性使其能够兼容多种架构，展现出提升模型性能的潜力，为异常检测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly
detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is
applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the
'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly
detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a
'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping
data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective
single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The
optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of
three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal
dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous
center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying
various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series
benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall
performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of
MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various
architectures.

TL;DR: 论文提出MAPLE框架，通过伪标记样本提升大语言模型在少标注数据下的上下文学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的多示例上下文学习（many-shot ICL）依赖大量标注数据，成本高昂。为解决这一问题，作者提出利用伪标记样本来弥补标注数据的不足。

Method: MAPLE框架首先筛选有影响力的未标注样本，通过查询大语言模型生成伪标签，并自适应地为每个测试查询选择和定制这些样本作为输入。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，MAPLE能够有效提升大语言模型的适应性和性能，同时显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过伪标记样本和自适应选择策略，成功实现了在有限标注数据下提升大语言模型的上下文学习性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as
demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the
expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds
of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples.
However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large
amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot
Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL
framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of
label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples
and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled
samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input
to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling
costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM
adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在知识图谱工程（KGE）任务中的性能与模型大小的关系，发现大多数情况下模型越大性能越好，但也存在性能饱和或下降的情况，建议权衡成本效益选择合适模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索大语言模型（LLM）在知识图谱工程（KGE）任务中的性能与模型大小的关系，以帮助在实际应用中权衡模型性能和资源成本。

Method: 使用LLM-KG-Bench框架对26个开源先进LLM进行评估，分析不同大小模型在KGE任务中的表现，并研究模型家族内部的性能变化。

Result: 研究发现，大多数情况下模型越大性能越好，但也存在性能饱和或下降的情况，某些较小模型在成本效益上表现更优。

Conclusion: 结论是模型大小与性能的关系在KGE任务中基本适用，但需注意性能饱和或下降的情况，建议根据任务需求选择合适大小的模型以提高成本效益。

Abstract: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph
Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an
appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models
typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are
also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between
model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison
of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of
understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in
an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the
model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how
benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,
we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of
models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few
exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected
KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,
the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger
model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high
cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger
models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects
occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next
smallest and largest model of the same family.

Motivation: 当前基于电子健康记录的深度学习模型虽预测准确率高，但缺乏可解释性和交互性，限制了临床医生的实际应用。

Method: 提出II-KEA框架，整合个性化知识库和代理驱动的大型语言模型，通过显式推理和因果分析增强可解释性，并支持医生通过知识库和提示注入经验。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上验证，II-KEA表现出优越性能，并通过案例研究证实了其可解释性和交互性的提升。

Conclusion: II-KEA框架有效解决了现有模型的可解释性和交互性问题，为临床决策提供了更实用的辅助工具。

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR)
data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the
potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning.
However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value:
interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models
makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind
predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally,
the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating
their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address
these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal
discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and
agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and
causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to
inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and
prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating
superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as
evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

Conclusion: EquivPruner通过高效剪枝语义冗余，为大语言模型的推理搜索提供了轻量化且有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning through search
algorithms, yet current strategies often suffer from massive token consumption
due to redundant exploration of semantically equivalent steps. Existing
semantic similarity methods struggle to accurately identify such equivalence in
domain-specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. To address this, we
propose EquivPruner, a simple yet effective approach that identifies and prunes
semantically equivalent actions during LLM reasoning search. We also introduce
MathEquiv, the first dataset we created for mathematical statement equivalence,
which enables the training of a lightweight equivalence detector. Extensive
experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate that EquivPruner
significantly reduces token consumption, improving searching efficiency and
often bolstering reasoning accuracy. For instance, when applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on GSM8K, EquivPruner reduced token consumption by
48.1\% while also improving accuracy. Our code is available at

Method: 提出ACPO强化学习框架，包含系统感知推理标记和在线难度估计，采用两阶段训练策略（监督微调+强化学习）。

Result: 实验表明ACPO能有效减少冗余推理，并根据任务复杂度自适应调整认知分配。

Conclusion: ACPO实现了透明化认知过程与动态系统切换，为高效混合推理提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant
content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in
cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a
reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient
reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO
incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens
to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive
process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token
length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during
reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy.
The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model,
enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the
second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for
difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO
effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive
allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

Conclusion: 结论指出，EGT有助于预测人类与AI的进化平衡，但未来研究需超越EGT，探索更多框架、实证验证方法及跨学科视角，同时关注伦理和认知影响。

Abstract: The serious games between humans and AI have only just begun. Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) models the competitive and cooperative strategies of
biological entities. EGT could help predict the potential evolutionary
equilibrium of humans and AI. The objective of this work was to examine some of
the EGT models relevant to human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution. Of
thirteen EGT models considered, three were examined: the Hawk-Dove Game,
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and the War of Attrition. This selection was based
on the widespread acceptance and clear relevance of these models to potential
human-AI evolutionary dynamics and coevolutionary trajectories. The Hawk-Dove
Game predicts balanced mixed-strategy equilibria based on the costs of
conflict. It also shows the potential for balanced coevolution rather than
dominance. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that repeated interaction may
lead to cognitive coevolution. It demonstrates how memory and reciprocity can
lead to cooperation. The War of Attrition suggests that competition for
resources may result in strategic coevolution, asymmetric equilibria, and
conventions on sharing resources. Therefore, EGT may provide a suitable
framework to understand and predict the human-AI evolutionary dynamic. However,
future research could extend beyond EGT and explore additional frameworks,
empirical validation methods, and interdisciplinary perspectives. AI is being
shaped by human input and is evolving in response to it. So too,
neuroplasticity allows the human brain to grow and evolve in response to
stimuli. If humans and AI converge in future, what might be the result of human
neuroplasticity combined with an ever-evolving AI? Future research should be
mindful of the ethical and cognitive implications of human-AI interaction,
evolution, and coevolution.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
multi-step reasoning and calling search engines at appropriate steps. However,
existing retrieval-augmented reasoning approaches rely on separate retrieval
models, limiting the LRM's role in retrieval to deciding when to retrieve and
how to query. This separation not only increases hardware and operational costs
but also leads to errors in the retrieval process due to the representation
bottleneck, a phenomenon where the retriever's embedding space is not
expressive enough to meet the generator's requirements. To address this, we
shift our perspective from sequence-to-sequence matching to locating the
answer-containing paths within the corpus, and propose a novel framework called
FREESON (Retriever-FREE Retrieval-Augmented ReaSONing). This framework enables
LRMs to retrieve relevant knowledge on their own by acting as both a generator
and retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of the MCTS algorithm
specialized for the retrieval task, which we call CT-MCTS (Corpus-Traversing
Monte Carlo Tree Search). In this algorithm, LRMs traverse through the corpus
toward answer-containing regions. Our results on five open-domain QA
benchmarks, including single-hop and multi-hop questions, show that FREESON
achieves an average improvement of 14.4% in EM and F1 over four multi-step
reasoning models with a separate retriever, and it also performs comparably to
the strongest baseline, surpassing it by 3% on PopQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

### [159] [Internal Bias in Reasoning Models leads to Overthinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16448)
*Renfei Dang,Shujian Huang,Jiajun Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前推理模型因过度反思导致计算资源浪费，研究发现这是由于模型对输入文本的内部偏见所致。通过掩盖输入部分可显著减少推理长度并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型虽具备强大探索能力，但常因冗余反思（即过度思考）而受诟病。本文首次揭示这种过度思考可能源于模型对输入文本的内部偏见。

Method: 通过可解释性实验发现模型对输入部分的过度关注放大了内部偏见的影响，并提出通过掩盖原始输入部分来缓解这一问题。

Result: 掩盖输入部分后，不同复杂推理任务的推理长度减少31%-53%，且在多数情况下准确性也有所提升。

Conclusion: 研究证实内部偏见与过度思考之间存在因果关系，掩盖输入部分是一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While current reasoning models possess strong exploratory capabilities, they
are often criticized for overthinking due to redundant and unnecessary
reflections. In this work, we reveal for the first time that overthinking in
reasoning models may stem from their internal bias towards input texts. Upon
encountering a reasoning problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary
guess about the answer, which we term as an internal bias since it is not
derived through actual reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its reasoning
result, the model tends to engage in reflection, leading to the waste of
computational resources. Through further interpretability experiments, we find
that this behavior is largely driven by the model's excessive attention to the
input section, which amplifies the influence of internal bias on its
decision-making process. Additionally, by masking out the original input
section, the affect of internal bias can be effectively alleviated and the
reasoning length could be reduced by 31%-53% across different complex reasoning
tasks. Notably, in most cases, this approach also leads to improvements in
accuracy. These findings demonstrate a causal relationship between internal
bias and overthinking.

*Mengzhu Liu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Chuan Ai,Chen Gao,Xinghong Li,Lingnan He,Kaisheng Lai,Yingfeng Chen,Xin Lu,Yong Li,Quanjun Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种心理学驱动的生成代理框架(PsychoAgent)，用于在突发灾难事件中预测社交媒体上的公众恐慌情绪，解决了数据标注不足、风险感知未建模和解释性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在突发灾难事件中预测公众恐慌情绪面临三大挑战：缺乏精细标注的数据、未建模的风险感知导致预测不准确，以及恐慌形成机制的解释性不足。

Method: 通过人机协作构建细粒度恐慌情绪数据集(COPE)，开发基于心理机制的跨领域异构数据框架建模风险感知和情绪生成的认知差异，并设计基于LLM的角色扮演代理模拟个体心理链。

Result: 实验结果显示，PsychoAgent在恐慌情绪预测上比基线模型提升了12.6%到21.7%的性能，并验证了方法的解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究实现了从'数据驱动拟合'到'基于角色模拟与机制解释'的范式转变，为紧急情况下的恐慌情绪预测提供了透明化的新方法。

Abstract: During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment
on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management.
Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely
annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception
causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic
formation mechanisms. We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven
generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based
on emotion arousal theory. Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open
panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs)
collaboration to mitigate semantic bias. Then, we develop a framework
integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological
mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion
generation. To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing
agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly
designed prompts. Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that
PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7%
compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the explainability and generalization
of our approach is validated. Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from
opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with
mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies.
Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Guiyao Tie,Xueyang Zhou,Tianhe Gu,Ruihang Zhang,Chaoran Hu,Sizhe Zhang,Mengqu Sun,Yan Zhang,Pan Zhou,Lichao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MMMR基准，用于严格评估多模态大语言模型的推理能力，发现即使顶尖模型也存在推理缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力缺乏标准化评估基准，特别是带有中间思考痕迹的模型（MLLMs-T），现有研究主要关注感知或最终答案正确性，对跨模态推理过程的理解有限。

Method: 引入MMMR基准，包括1）一个包含1,083个高难度问题的数据集，涵盖六种推理类型；2）一个模块化的推理痕迹评估管道（RTEP），通过相关性、一致性和结构化错误注释等指标评估推理质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs-T总体优于非思考模型，但即使如Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Gemini-2.5 Pro等顶尖模型也存在不一致和过度思考等推理缺陷。

Conclusion: MMMR基准揭示了准确性与推理质量之间的持续差距，并为未来模型开发提供了可操作的评估管道，为评估、比较和改进下一代多模态推理系统提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door
to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific
analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs,
particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T),
remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing
work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering
limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address
this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a
high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types
with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace
Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy
through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.
Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking
counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro
suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This
benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and
provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.
Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and
improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过迭代的自我反思学习，提升小语言模型（SLMs）的元自省和推理能力，而无需依赖大模型蒸馏或精细人工标注。

Method: 提出ReflectEvo框架，通过迭代生成自我反思数据进行自训练，构建包含46万条多领域指令的ReflectEvo-460k数据集，并采用SFT和DPO方法进行模型优化。

Result: 实验显示该方法显著提升模型推理能力：Llama-3准确率从52.4%提升至71.2%，Mistral从44.4%提升至71.1%，性能媲美主流开源模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过持续迭代的反思学习可有效提升小语言模型的推理能力，自我生成的反思数据对错误定位和修正具有高质量影响，展现了长期优化SLMs的潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language
models (SLMs) can enhance meta introspection through reflection learning. This
process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a
continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct
ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection
dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building
upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to
improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable
performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral
from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the
reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench
without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We
further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated
reflections and their impact on error localization and correction. Our work
highlights the potential of continuously enhancing the reasoning performance of
SLMs through iterative reflection learning in the long run.

Abstract: With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing
productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in
experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry
and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability
persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are
redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications
across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to
discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective
creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all
steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and
alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The
transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity,
oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into
creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific
disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must
also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations
with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the
potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise
remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的部分充电方法，采用双层优化方案来最小化无线可充电传感器网络（WRSNs）中的能量耗尽问题，同时优化充电路径和时间。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的无线可充电传感器网络（WRSNs）主要采用完全充电方法优化充电路径，但这种方法可能导致部分传感器因充电延迟过长而失效。因此，需要一种更有效的充电策略来避免这一问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种部分充电方法，通过双层优化方案同时优化充电路径和时间。具体包括两种近似算法：第一种结合了多起点局部搜索方法和遗传算法；第二种采用了嵌套方法，利用多任务和协方差矩阵自适应进化策略的优势。

Result: 实验验证表明，所提出的算法在各种网络场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的双层优化部分充电方法有效解决了WRSNs中的能量耗尽问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the
advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising
opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective
charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical
charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on
optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may
lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging
latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a
bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at
optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To
accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated
problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization
of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and
lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local
Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm
adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations
on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms
outperform the existing works.

Motivation: 为了扩展不完整论证框架（IAF）中单个论证的稳定性相关概念，研究论证集合验证稳定性的相关性，以确定在何种情况下需要解决不确定性以确保验证结果的一致性。

Method: 提出了论证集合验证稳定性的相关性和强相关性概念，并分析了在不同语义下检测相关性的计算复杂度。

Result: 在大多数讨论的语义下，检测论证集合的（强）相关性可以在P时间内完成，但在基础语义下难以找到高效方法。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了相关性的概念，并展示了在不同语义下的计算复杂度，为不完整论证框架的稳定性分析提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The notion of relevance was proposed for stability of justification status of
a single argument in incomplete argumentation frameworks (IAFs) in 2024 by
Odekerken et al. To extend the notion, we study the relevance for stability of
verification status of a set of arguments in this paper, i.e., the
uncertainties in an IAF that have to be resolved in some situations so that
answering whether a given set of arguments is an extension obtains the same
result in every completion of the IAF. Further we propose the notion of strong
relevance for describing the necessity of resolution in all situations reaching
stability. An analysis of complexity reveals that detecting the (strong)
relevance for stability of sets of arguments can be accomplished in P time
under the most semantics discussed in the paper. We also discuss the difficulty
in finding tractable methods for relevance detection under grounded semantics.

Method: 提出D2R框架，将文本思维链与动态视觉草稿结合，无需训练即可集成到多模态大语言模型中。

Result: 实验表明D2R在多样化任务中持续提升性能，为动态空间推理建立了强基线。

Conclusion: 动态视觉草稿与文本推理链的结合显著提升了模型在动态环境中的空间推理能力。

Abstract: While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or
static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To
bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark
designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that
augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on
input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new
insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this
capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free
framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual
drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently
enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学任务上的表现是否真正反映推理能力尚存疑虑，传统评估指标（如答案准确率）无法区分核心能力，诊断价值有限。

Method: 引入SMART框架，将数学问题分解为理解、推理、计算、反思优化四个维度，通过自动化生成和验证机制实现可扩展的细粒度评估。

Result: 对21个前沿开源和闭源模型的测试显示，各模型在不同维度能力差异显著，证实单一答案准确率指标的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要采用更全面的评估指标以真实捕捉模型的问题解决能力，SMART为此提供了可解释、细粒度的分析工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of
mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes
reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition.
Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle
the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To
address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and
Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes
mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding,
reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is
evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated
self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark
data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant
discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings
demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and
motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving
capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有推理数据集在测试抽象、多步骤问题（如路径规划和复杂规则约束）时表现饱和，无法有效评估。

Method: 引入SPaRC数据集，包含1000个2D网格路径规划谜题，结合算术和几何规则，测试空间与符号推理能力。

Result: 人类准确率近完美（98.0%），而最佳模型（如o4-mini）仅15.8%；模型常生成无效路径，且在空间逻辑上犯错。

Conclusion: SPaRC揭示了模型空间推理的局限性，未来需改进训练方法和测试时计算效率以提升性能。

Abstract: Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step
problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We
introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000
2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning,
requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans
achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best
reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles).
Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and
reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic.
Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time
compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts
improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with
improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as
a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward
new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.

Motivation: 随着LLM从被动文本生成器发展为能主动使用工具进行推理的智能体，现有的评估方法无法充分衡量其在新范式下的工具利用能力。

Method: 提出MCP-RADAR基准，采用答案准确性、工具选择效率、计算资源效率、参数构建准确性和执行速度五个维度进行客观量化评估。

Result: 评估显示主流LLM在准确性、效率和速度之间存在显著权衡，挑战了传统单一指标的性能排名，并为开发者提供了工具优化建议。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于MCP框架，也可推广到所有LLM工具集成框架，为优化LLM与工具的交互生态系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active
reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and
orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation
methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within
this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP
framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy,
tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter
construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that
rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR
employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains
including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general
problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs
reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric
performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to
optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While
focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains
applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable
insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire
LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and
datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of major breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence (AI) over the past fifteen years, integrating
historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. It identifies key
inflection points in AI' s evolution by tracing the convergence of
computational resources, data access, and algorithmic innovation. The analysis
highlights how researchers enabled GPU based model training, triggered a data
centric shift with ImageNet, simplified architectures through the Transformer,
and expanded modeling capabilities with the GPT series. Rather than treating
these advances as isolated milestones, the paper frames them as indicators of
deeper paradigm shifts. By applying concepts from statistical learning theory
such as sample complexity and data efficiency, the paper explains how
researchers translated breakthroughs into scalable solutions and why the field
must now embrace data centric approaches. In response to rising privacy
concerns and tightening regulations, the paper evaluates emerging solutions
like federated learning, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and the data
site paradigm, which reframe data access and security. In cases where real
world data remains inaccessible, the paper also assesses the utility and
constraints of mock and synthetic data generation. By aligning technical
insights with evolving data infrastructure, this study offers strategic
guidance for future AI research and policy development.

Abstract: In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social
structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional
opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel
social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates
three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic
opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly
model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing
irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion
similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their
communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social
relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions,
allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more
effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is
constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion
evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV
cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus
analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify
the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing
realistic decision-making behaviors.

*Ashish Sundar,Chunbo Luo,Xiaoyang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的基于模型的强化学习方法，通过主动寻找高熵状态来优化世界模型的学习，从而提升样本效率和策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型的强化学习方法（MBRL）主要关注策略优化，而忽视了世界模型学习的改进。提高世界模型的准确性和收敛速度可以带来显著的下游收益，如提升训练出的策略性能。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，利用世界模型生成的短时潜在预测主动寻找高熵状态，并采用分层规划器动态决定重新规划的时间、规划长度以及奖励与熵的权重。

Result: 在Miniworld程序生成的迷宫中，该方法比基础Dreamer收敛速度快50%，且策略训练所需的环境步数仅为Dreamer的60%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化世界模型学习，显著提升了样本效率和策略性能，为基于模型的强化学习提供了新的改进方向。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers an intuitive way to increase
the sample efficiency of model-free RL methods by simultaneously training a
world model that learns to predict the future. MBRL methods have progressed by
largely prioritising the actor; optimising the world model learning has been
neglected meanwhile. Improving the fidelity of the world model and reducing its
time to convergence can yield significant downstream benefits, one of which is
improving the ensuing performance of any actor it may train. We propose a novel
approach that anticipates and actively seeks out high-entropy states using
short-horizon latent predictions generated by the world model, offering a
principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase
once-novel states well after they were stumbled into. While many model
predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they
typically lack commitment, synthesising multi step plans after every step. To
mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when
to replan, planning horizon length, and the weighting between reward and
entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains
its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to just
Dreamer as a proof of concept. Our method finishes the Miniworld procedurally
generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and the policy
trained in imagination converges in only 60% of the environment steps that base
Dreamer needs.

*Wei Sun,Wen Yang,Pu Jian,Qianlong Du,Fuwei Cui,Shuo Ren,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出KTAE算法，通过细粒度token级优势估计提升强化学习在语言模型推理中的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法（如GRPO及其变体DAPO）在计算优势时粒度较粗，无法捕捉token级贡献，影响学习效果。

Method: 提出KTAE算法，结合采样rollout的正确性和统计分析，量化token重要性，并与rollout级优势结合，实现细粒度优势估计。

Result: 实验表明，GRPO+KTAE和DAPO+KTAE在五个数学推理基准上优于基线方法，且能以更短响应达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: KTAE有效解决了现有算法粒度粗的问题，显著提升了模型推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning
with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent
reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO,
suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage.
Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical
values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific
contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we
propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that
estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional
models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies
statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a
sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then
combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained
token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained
with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with
shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base
model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GUI-explorer，一种无需训练的GUI代理，通过自主探索和状态转换知识挖掘，显著提升动态环境中的GUI自动化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的GUI自动化面临两大挑战：多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)对UI组件的误解析和知识过时问题。传统微调方法更新应用特定知识成本高昂。

Method: 1) 功能感知轨迹自主探索：通过分析GUI结构信息自动生成探索目标；2) 状态转换知识无监督挖掘：通过分析结构化交互三元组(观察、动作、结果)的状态转换提取精确的屏幕操作逻辑。

Result: 在SPA-Bench和AndroidWorld上分别达到53.7%和47.4%的任务成功率，显著优于现有技术，且无需为新应用更新参数。

Conclusion: GUI-explorer通过免训练机制有效解决了动态环境中的GUI自动化挑战，其开源特性将促进相关领域发展。

Abstract: GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs
suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated
knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific
knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that
incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of
Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application
functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that
automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural
information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables
systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining
of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we
develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective
screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of
structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates
the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success
rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows
significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for
new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出EduVisBench基准和EduVisAgent框架，评估并提升基础模型在教育可视化中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型在教育场景中生成可视化解释的能力有限，缺乏结构化与可解释的视觉支持。

Method: 引入多领域、多层次的EduVisBench基准，并提出多智能体协作框架EduVisAgent，分解推理并优化可视化设计。

Result: EduVisAgent显著优于基线模型，性能提升40.2%，生成更符合教育需求的可视化结果。

Conclusion: 通过基准测试与协作框架，有效解决了基础模型在教育可视化中的推理与表达瓶颈。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational
contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations
remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,
overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in
supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning
capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a
multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem
sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained
evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis
reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of
decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations
aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we
propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates
specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,
metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show
that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%
improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

*Jiaqi Wang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,James Cheng,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出TON方法，通过两阶段训练让视觉语言模型自主决定何时需要推理，显著减少计算成本且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类思考方式启发，希望模型能像人一样对简单问题跳过推理、对复杂问题深入思考，从而降低冗余计算。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 监督微调阶段引入'思维丢弃'操作；2) GRPO阶段让模型自主探索何时推理。

Result: TON相比GRPO减少90%生成长度，性能无损甚至提升，模型能逐步学会跳过不必要推理。

Conclusion: TON为强化学习方法实现类人推理模式提供了新路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training
strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that
encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,
leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the
human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but
think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when
reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training
strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective
'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with
empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold
start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to
freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome
rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by
up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even
improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering
a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently
reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning
steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward
human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CondKGCP方法，通过合并相似谓词和利用排序信息增强校准，为知识图谱嵌入提供更精确的条件覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法的不确定性量化仅提供平均覆盖保证，无法满足高风险应用（如医疗诊断）对每个查询一致覆盖的需求。

Method: CondKGCP合并向量表示相似的谓词，并在校准过程中加入排序信息，以近似实现谓词条件覆盖保证。

Result: 理论证明CondKGCP能提供条件覆盖保证，并通过全面实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CondKGCP在保持预测集紧凑性的同时，显著提升了知识图谱嵌入的不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods is
crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. A recent work
applies conformal prediction to KGE methods, providing uncertainty estimates by
generating a set of answers that is guaranteed to include the true answer with
a predefined confidence level. However, existing methods provide probabilistic
guarantees averaged over a reference set of queries and answers (marginal
coverage guarantee). In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a
stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide
consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee). We propose
CondKGCP, a novel method that approximates predicate-conditional coverage
guarantees while maintaining compact prediction sets. CondKGCP merges
predicates with similar vector representations and augments calibration with
rank information. We prove the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirical
effectiveness of CondKGCP by comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have historically been used as tools
that execute narrowly defined tasks. Yet recent advances in AI have unlocked
possibilities for a new class of models that genuinely collaborate with humans
in complex reasoning, from conceptualizing problems to brainstorming solutions.
Such AI thought partners enable novel forms of collaboration and extended
cognition, yet they also pose major risks-including and beyond risks of typical
AI tools and agents. In this commentary, we systematically identify risks of AI
thought partners through a novel framework that identifies risks at multiple
levels of analysis, including Real-time, Individual, and Societal risks arising
from collaborative cognition (RISc). We leverage this framework to propose
concrete metrics for risk evaluation, and finally suggest specific mitigation
strategies for developers and policymakers. As AI thought partners continue to
proliferate, these strategies can help prevent major harms and ensure that
humans actively benefit from productive thought partnerships.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including
interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and
Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context
reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the
challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies
and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a
foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust,

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop
LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:
agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,
such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While
adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether
LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM
instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key
characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic
applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.
(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse
constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To
construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50
agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic
systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and
corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based
evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically
evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally
perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool
specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on
instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the
failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to
facilitate future research.

Result: 现有LLM语法生成表现不佳，HyGenar算法在语法结构和语义正确性上均实现显著改进。

Conclusion: HyGenar有效解决了LLM语法生成的局限性，为结构化输出提供了新方法。

Abstract: Grammar plays a critical role in natural language processing and text/code
generation by enabling the definition of syntax, the creation of parsers, and
guiding structured outputs. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive capabilities across domains, their ability to infer and generate
grammars has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we aim to study
and improve the ability of LLMs for few-shot grammar generation, where grammars
are inferred from sets of a small number of positive and negative examples and
generated in Backus-Naur Form. To explore this, we introduced a novel dataset
comprising 540 structured grammar generation challenges, devised 6 metrics, and
evaluated 8 various LLMs against it. Our findings reveal that existing LLMs
perform sub-optimally in grammar generation. To address this, we propose an
LLM-driven hybrid genetic algorithm, namely HyGenar, to optimize grammar
generation. HyGenar achieves substantial improvements in both the syntactic and
semantic correctness of generated grammars across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单智能体LLM存在上下文有限、角色过载和领域迁移脆弱等问题，传统多智能体方法又引入分解不当、模糊合约和验证开销等新问题。

Method: 提出Know-The-Ropes框架，将领域先验转化为算法蓝图层次结构，递归分解任务为类型化子任务，采用最轻量增强策略（如思维链、微调、自检）。

Result: 在背包问题（3-8项）上，3个GPT-4o-mini智能体将准确率从零样本3%提升至95%；在任务分配问题（6-15项）上，6智能体方案在10项内达100%准确率，13-15项达84%。

Conclusion: 算法感知的任务分解加针对性增强可使小模型成为可靠协作工具，无需依赖超大模型。

Abstract: Single-agent LLMs hit hard limits--finite context, role overload, and brittle
domain transfer. Conventional multi-agent fixes soften those edges yet expose
fresh pains: ill-posed decompositions, fuzzy contracts, and verification
overhead that blunts the gains. We therefore present Know-The-Ropes (KtR), a
framework that converts domain priors into an algorithmic blueprint hierarchy,
in which tasks are recursively split into typed, controller-mediated subtasks,
each solved zero-shot or with the lightest viable boost (e.g.,
chain-of-thought, micro-tune, self-check). Grounded in the No-Free-Lunch
theorem, KtR trades the chase for a universal prompt for disciplined
decomposition. On the Knapsack problem (3-8 items), three GPT-4o-mini agents
raise accuracy from 3% zero-shot to 95% on size-5 instances after patching a
single bottleneck agent. On the tougher Task-Assignment problem (6-15 jobs), a
six-agent o3-mini blueprint hits 100% up to size 10 and 84% on sizes 13-15,
versus 11% zero-shot. Algorithm-aware decomposition plus targeted augmentation
thus turns modest models into reliable collaborators--no ever-larger monoliths
required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal
understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM
agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and
perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this
requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic
frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating
heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured
knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock
transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through
automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine
through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster
interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to
develop reliable AI partners for biomedical progress.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于异构大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统（X-MAS），通过引入多样化LLM驱动的智能体，显著提升了系统性能，无需结构重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多智能体系统（MAS）框架依赖单一LLM驱动所有智能体，限制了系统的智能水平。论文探索了异构LLM驱动的MAS（X-MAS），以提升系统整体智能。

Method: 论文介绍了X-MAS-Bench测试平台，评估了27种LLM在5个领域和5种功能上的表现，进行了超过170万次评估，以确定最佳模型组合。

Result: 实验表明，异构LLM驱动的MAS在聊天机器人场景中性能提升8.4%，在混合聊天-推理场景中性能提升47%。

Conclusion: 异构LLM在多智能体系统中具有变革性潜力，为可扩展、协作式AI系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by
enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing
MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the
system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the
paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by
diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence
of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to
evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and
MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs
across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over
1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each
domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that
transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can
significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.
Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration
yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed
chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable
47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the
transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising
avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视负样本中的自反思和纠错步骤等有价值信息，导致学习信号未被充分利用。

Method: BCPG-NSA框架包含样本分割、基于共识的步骤正确性评估及负样本增强策略优化三阶段。

Result: 在数学/编程推理基准测试中超越基线，样本效率提升且扩展至多轮迭代仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 负样本中的潜在学习信号可被有效挖掘，BCPG-NSA为长链推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Motivation: 现有的图标记学习模型（TGLMs）依赖手工设计的标记列表，存在对邻近节点过度关注的问题，导致无法平衡局部和全局信号，尤其在异配性图中表现不佳。

Method: 提出可学习的图标记列表（LGTL），通过图注意力门模块和选择模块自适应调整跳数权重并优先选择信息丰富的节点，从而解决跳数过度优先问题。

Result: 实验证明，LGTL在图Transformer和图LLM骨干网络中均有效，能够显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: LGTL作为一种即插即用模块，能够自适应地强调上下文信息丰富的节点，适用于同配性和异配性图，解决了手工设计标记列表的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range
dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine
learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph
Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered
token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language
Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are
also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed
token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains
unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical
preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an
unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists
overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local
and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic
graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List
(LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs.
Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes
informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a
selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can
be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides,
we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both
Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为LLEB（最后一层经验贝叶斯）的新方法，用于量化神经网络预测的不确定性，该方法在标准贝叶斯神经网络和集成方法之间进行插值，并在性能上与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络预测的不确定性是人工智能中的一个关键挑战。贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）和深度集成是解决这一挑战的主要方法。本文受最近研究表明集成方法使用的分布可以理解为对应于学习到的数据依赖先验的后验启发，提出了LLEB方法。

Method: LLEB方法通过实例化一个可学习的先验作为归一化流，然后训练该流以最大化证据下界；为了保持可操作性，仅在最后一层使用该流。

Result: LLEB在性能上与现有方法相当，表明经验贝叶斯是不确定性量化未来研究的一个有前景的方向。

Conclusion: LLEB方法在标准贝叶斯神经网络和集成方法之间进行插值，展示了经验贝叶斯在不确定性量化中的潜力。

Abstract: The task of quantifying the inherent uncertainty associated with neural
network predictions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles are among the most prominent
approaches to tackle this task. Both approaches produce predictions by
computing an expectation of neural network outputs over some distribution on
the corresponding weights; this distribution is given by the posterior in the
case of BNNs, and by a mixture of point masses for ensembles. Inspired by
recent work showing that the distribution used by ensembles can be understood
as a posterior corresponding to a learned data-dependent prior, we propose last
layer empirical Bayes (LLEB). LLEB instantiates a learnable prior as a
normalizing flow, which is then trained to maximize the evidence lower bound;
to retain tractability we use the flow only on the last layer. We show why LLEB
is well motivated, and how it interpolates between standard BNNs and ensembles
in terms of the strength of the prior that they use. LLEB performs on par with
existing approaches, highlighting that empirical Bayes is a promising direction
for future research in uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，RTN（最近舍入）量化技术被认为不如更先进的量化方法，但本文旨在挑战这一观点，展示RTN在成本、吞吐量和精度上的优势。

Method: 基于Marlin内核实现RTN，并通过选择性提高某些模型层和模块的数据精度格式逐步提升RTN的精度。

Result: RTN的令牌生成吞吐量优于更先进的替代方案，且精度与之相似，同时应用成本更低。

Conclusion: RTN是量化大型语言模型的一个可行且实用的选择。

Abstract: Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large
Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest
quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the
forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed
by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over
RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this
established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply,
but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be
similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our
implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how
the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the
data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our
results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for
quantizing LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习评估库存在碎片化、实现不一致和数据验证不足的问题，导致结果不可靠。缺乏统一标准使得跨框架比较困难。

Method: 开发AllMetrics库，通过模块化API和输入验证机制，支持多种机器学习任务，并解决不同实现间的指标计算差异。

Result: AllMetrics在多个领域的数据集上测试，与Python、Matlab和R组件比较，验证了其可靠性和可重复性。

Conclusion: AllMetrics通过标准化和验证机制，提高了机器学习工作流程的可信度，减少了评估错误。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate
performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However,
existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent
implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to
unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently
and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the
specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt
its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error
handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to
both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it
difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations.
To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python
library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks,
including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and
image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for
multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while
incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation
discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like
healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared
with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results.
AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with
robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in
model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural
components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate
evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前fMRI视觉解码研究过于注重重建保真度而忽视可解释性，而可解释性对神经科学研究和脑机接口至关重要。

Method: 采用受大脑网络启发的混合专家架构，专家网络处理功能相关体素信号并编码到CLIP空间，通过微调扩散模型和双阶段路由机制重建图像。

Conclusion: MoRE-Brain在可泛化和可解释的fMRI视觉解码方面取得重要进展，为神经机制研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand
human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However,
current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while
overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific
insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework
designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.
MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture
where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel
groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to
encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then
synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing
mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion
process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a
novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for
neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by
sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.
Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing
reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and
spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate
MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further
demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine
neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,
MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and
interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon:

Abstract: We study identifiability of stochastic differential equation (SDE) models
under multiple interventions. Our results give the first provable bounds for
unique recovery of SDE parameters given samples from their stationary
distributions. We give tight bounds on the number of necessary interventions
for linear SDEs, and upper bounds for nonlinear SDEs in the small noise regime.
We experimentally validate the recovery of true parameters in synthetic data,
and motivated by our theoretical results, demonstrate the advantage of
parameterizations with learnable activation functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAE）用于解释大语言模型内部激活，但现有评估忽视概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性。研究发现微小对抗扰动即可操纵SAE解释，表明其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE评估指标（如重建-稀疏性权衡、可解释性）未考虑概念表示的鲁棒性，而鲁棒性对概念标注的保真度至关重要。

Method: 将鲁棒性量化为输入空间优化问题，构建包含对抗扰动场景的评估框架，测试SAE表示的可操纵性。

Result: 实验表明，微小对抗扰动能有效操纵SAE的概念解释，且基本不影响底层大语言模型的输出。

Conclusion: SAE概念表示脆弱，可能不适合用于模型监控与监督等应用场景。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal
activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to
human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs
focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human
(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical
aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We
argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept
representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we
formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and
develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in
which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.
Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively
manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably
affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest
that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for
applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Conclusion: GradPCA在OOD检测中表现优异，特征质量（如预训练表示）对检测效果至关重要，理论分析为未来检测器设计提供了基础。

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that
exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than
existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a
theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support
GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection
and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that
feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained
representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will
succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and
our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled
spectral OOD detectors.

Result: 发现最优策略存在尖锐的相变现象，并受数据协方差结构影响。

Conclusion: 研究增强了扩散轨迹蒸馏的理论理解，并为改进蒸馏策略提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in
diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow
sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the
multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,
enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off
between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain
limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a
first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory
distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each
step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy
data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and
rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal
shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both
discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a
dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that
maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence
of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data
covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of
diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving
distillation strategies.

Motivation: 现有神经算子为基础的Eikonal求解器在表示效率、几何基础及解的可控性方面存在不足，需要一种能统一处理多种流形且具备用户可控性的新方法。

Method: 采用等变神经场（ENF）与神经Eikonal求解器结合，通过共享主干网络和信号特定潜变量（李群点云）建模多样解，并耦合物理信息神经网络（PINNs）实现广义黎曼流形求解。

Conclusion: 该框架通过等变性与物理约束的结合，为Eikonal问题提供了高效、可解释且通用的求解方案，尤其适用于复杂几何场景。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that
integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our
approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is
conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds
in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration
ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution
field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency
through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability.
This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to
induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting
Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models
Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian
manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as
Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We
validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of
2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to
existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

Motivation: 传统的SAT求解器性能依赖于手工设计的启发式策略，限制了其效率和泛化能力。本文旨在通过数据驱动的方法，自动学习更优的启发式策略。

Method: 采用强化学习从算法反馈（RLAF）框架，结合图神经网络（GNN）为变量分配权重和极性，通过策略梯度方法（如GRPO）训练模型，直接以求解器的计算成本作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，RLAF训练的策略显著降低了不同SAT求解器的平均求解时间，某些情况下提速超过2倍，并能有效泛化到更大、更难的问题。

Conclusion: RLAF为组合优化中的数据驱动启发式设计提供了有前景的路径，其性能优于基于手工启发式的专家监督方法。

Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science,
yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work
introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm
for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for
injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching
heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns
these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a
reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf
policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's
computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of
different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more
than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and
harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform
expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting
heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in
combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
(LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy
large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert
offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on
slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited
the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar
experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models
and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure
local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance
(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs
of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which
measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size
limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found
that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit
the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that
domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than
vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache
effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active
experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and
deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for
replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

### [201] [Mesh-free sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16058)
*Mars Liyao Gao,J. Nathan Kutz,Bernat Font*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为mesh-free SINDy的新算法，利用神经网络和自动微分从任意传感器位置和非均匀时间采样数据中识别控制方程，具有高噪声鲁棒性和计算高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法识别动态系统控制方程需要高质量、均匀采样的时空数据，限制了其应用范围。本文旨在解决这一问题，提出一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 结合神经网络近似和自动微分技术，开发mesh-free SINDy算法，无需结构化网格数据，且训练过程简单，几乎无需超参数调优。

Result: 在多种PDE（如Burgers方程、热方程等）上验证了算法的有效性，即使在高噪声（75%）和低数据量（100样本）情况下仍能成功识别方程，训练时间不超过一分钟。

Conclusion: mesh-free SINDy算法具有广泛适用性，能有效处理非均匀采样和高噪声数据，为科学和工程问题提供了一种高效的方程识别工具。

Abstract: Identifying the governing equations of a dynamical system is one of the most
important tasks for scientific modeling. However, this procedure often requires
high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In
this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the
power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to
identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform
temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise
levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our
implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of
hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many
scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat
equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion
equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying
the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to
previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise
and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery,
achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers'
equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All
of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Model Feedback Learning (MFL)，一种无需重新训练模型或修改硬件即可优化预训练AI模型输入的新框架，适用于半导体制造等多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要调整模型参数，但在实际应用中（如半导体制造），修改已部署系统往往不可行或成本过高，因此需要一种无需修改系统即可优化输入的方法。

Method: MFL利用轻量级反向模型迭代搜索最优输入，结合稳定性感知优化，实现在部署约束下的高效适应。

Result: 在半导体等离子蚀刻任务中，MFL仅需5次迭代即可生成目标配方，显著优于贝叶斯优化和人类专家，并在化学过程和电子系统中表现优异。

Conclusion: MFL为现实环境中的智能控制提供了一种可扩展且高效的范式，适用于多种高维控制场景。

Abstract: We introduce Model Feedback Learning (MFL), a novel test-time optimization
framework for optimizing inputs to pre-trained AI models or deployed hardware
systems without requiring any retraining of the models or modifications to the
hardware. In contrast to existing methods that rely on adjusting model
parameters, MFL leverages a lightweight reverse model to iteratively search for
optimal inputs, enabling efficient adaptation to new objectives under
deployment constraints. This framework is particularly advantageous in
real-world settings, such as semiconductor manufacturing recipe generation,
where modifying deployed systems is often infeasible or cost-prohibitive. We
validate MFL on semiconductor plasma etching tasks, where it achieves target
recipe generation in just five iterations, significantly outperforming both
Bayesian optimization and human experts. Beyond semiconductor applications, MFL
also demonstrates strong performance in chemical processes (e.g., chemical
vapor deposition) and electronic systems (e.g., wire bonding), highlighting its
broad applicability. Additionally, MFL incorporates stability-aware
optimization, enhancing robustness to process variations and surpassing
conventional supervised learning and random search methods in high-dimensional
control settings. By enabling few-shot adaptation, MFL provides a scalable and
efficient paradigm for deploying intelligent control in real-world
environments.

*Zhixu Silvia Tao,Kasper Vinken,Hao-Wei Yeh,Avi Cooper,Xavier Boix*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Merge to Mix的新方法，通过模型合并加速数据集混合的构建，避免了传统试错法中的多次微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在构建数据集混合以微调大模型时，通常依赖启发式方法和反复试错，效率低下且耗时。

Method: 利用模型合并技术，将分别在单个数据集上微调的模型合并，作为在整个混合数据集上微调的替代方案。

Result: 实验表明，Merge to Mix在数据集选择方面超越了现有技术，显著提高了效率。

Conclusion: Merge to Mix为高效构建数据集混合提供了一种创新方法，减少了传统方法中的计算负担。

Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for
maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective
dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often
requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose
a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset
mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that
combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM
by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging
models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively
serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix
leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without
requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments
demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset
selection for fine-tuning LMs.

*Bart Kosko,Olaoluwa Adigun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出双向变分自编码器（BVAE），通过单一神经网络实现编解码，参数减少50%且性能略优于传统VAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变分自编码器（VAE）需要独立的编码器和解码器网络，导致参数量较大。BVAE旨在通过双向结构减少参数并保持性能。

Method: BVAE使用单一神经网络，正向编码、反向解码通过同一组突触连接。在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST等数据集上测试重建、分类等任务。

Result: BVAE参数量减少近50%，在图像重建、分类等任务中略优于传统单向VAE。

Conclusion: 双向结构能有效压缩模型规模，同时保持或提升性能，为轻量化VAE提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present the new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network
architecture. The BVAE uses a single neural network both to encode and decode
instead of an encoder-decoder network pair. The network encodes in the forward
direction and decodes in the backward direction through the same synaptic web.
Simulations compared BVAEs and ordinary VAEs on the four image tasks of image
reconstruction, classification, interpolation, and generation. The image
datasets included MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CelebA-64 face images. The bidirectional structure of BVAEs cut the parameter
count by almost 50% and still slightly outperformed the unidirectional VAEs.

### [205] [Ensembling Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16077)
*Soham Gadgil,Chris Lin,Su-In Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过集成多个稀疏自编码器(SAE)提升语言模型激活重建和特征多样性，优于单一SAE在下游任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单一稀疏自编码器(SAE)只能捕捉激活空间中的有限特征子集，不同初始权重训练的SAE会学习到不同特征。

Method: 提出两种集成方法：1) 朴素装袋法(naive bagging)集成不同初始化的SAE；2) 提升法(boosting)顺序训练SAE以最小化残差。

Result: 实验表明集成SAE能改善激活重建、特征多样性和稳定性，在概念检测和伪相关消除等下游任务表现更优。

Conclusion: 集成多个SAE比单一SAE具有更强的实用价值，能更全面地提取特征并提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE
are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that
SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features,
demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that
can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting.
Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled
in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual
error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three
settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results
demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language
model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore,
ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks
such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved
practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FR-Mamba框架，结合FNO和SSM，高效重建物理场分布，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以捕捉长程时间依赖，导致在时变物理系统中表现不佳。

Method: 设计混合神经网络架构，结合FNO捕捉全局空间特征，Mamba建模长程时间依赖。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在流场重建任务中显著优于现有PFR方法，长序列上实现高精度。

Conclusion: FR-Mamba框架通过融合时空特征，有效解决了物理场重建中的长程依赖问题。

Abstract: Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of
physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on
limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail
to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose
FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on
state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network
architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model
(SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal
dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture,
to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In
parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by
leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations
extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field
distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field
reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

Conclusion: 研究表明，强化学习方法可以有效地应用于股票市场分析，不同RL方法在策略学习和利润最大化方面表现各异。

Abstract: Much research has been done to analyze the stock market. After all, if one
can determine a pattern in the chaotic frenzy of transactions, then they could
make a hefty profit from capitalizing on these insights. As such, the goal of
our project was to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to determine the best time
to buy a stock within a given time frame. With only a few adjustments, our
model can be extended to identify the best time to sell a stock as well. In
order to use the format of free, real-world data to train the model, we define
our own Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. These two papers [5] [6] helped
us in formulating the state space and the reward system of our MDP problem. We
train a series of agents using Q-Learning, Q-Learning with linear function
approximation, and deep Q-Learning. In addition, we try to predict the stock
prices using machine learning regression and classification models. We then
compare our agents to see if they converge on a policy, and if so, which one
learned the best policy to maximize profit on the stock market.

Abstract: Keylogger detection involves monitoring for unusual system behaviors such as
delays between typing and character display, analyzing network traffic patterns
for data exfiltration. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis for
keylogger detection with traditional machine learning models - SVC, Random
Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
and advanced ensemble methods including Stacking, Blending and Voting.
Moreover, feature selection approaches such as Information gain, Lasso L1 and
Fisher Score are thoroughly assessed to improve predictive performance and
lower computational complexity. The Keylogger Detection dataset from publicly
available Kaggle website is used in this project. In addition to accuracy-based
classification, this study implements the approach for model interpretation
using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques namely SHAP (Global) and LIME (Local) to
deliver finer explanations for how much each feature contributes in assisting
or hindering the detection process. To evaluate the models result, we have used
AUC score, sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and F1 score. The best
performance was achieved by AdaBoost with 99.76% accuracy, F1 score of 0.99,
100% precision, 98.6% recall, 1.0 specificity and 0.99 of AUC that is
near-perfect classification with Fisher Score.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，用于量化结合外部工具的大型语言模型（LLM）的不确定性，以提高在高风险应用中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLMs常需依赖外部工具来补充其知识不足，但如何评估这种结合系统的可信度成为关键挑战，尤其是在医疗等高风险领域。

Method: 论文扩展了现有不确定性量化方法，联合考虑LLM和外部工具的预测不确定性，并提出了高效近似计算方法。

Result: 在两个合成QA数据集和RAG系统上的实验表明，该框架能有效增强对LLM系统的信任，特别是在需要外部工具的场景中。

Conclusion: 该框架通过量化不确定性，显著提升了依赖外部工具的LLM系统的可靠性，为高风险应用提供了更可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as
machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide
accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient.
This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also
introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses
generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical
decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's
generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final
response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account
for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute
to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework
for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly
considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We
extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to
this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty
computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on
two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning
datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we
apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty
metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our
results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based
systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient
and external tools are required.

*Aditya T. Vadlamani,Anutam Srinivasan,Pranav Maneriker,Ali Payani,Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为“Conformal Fairness”的公平性概念，利用保形预测（CP）方法控制不同敏感群体间的覆盖差距，适用于非独立同分布数据（如图数据）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保形预测（CP）虽能提供真实标签覆盖的概率保证，但这些保证忽略了数据集中敏感属性的存在。因此，需要一种方法来确保不同敏感群体间的公平覆盖。

Method: 论文提出了“Conformal Fairness”框架，基于保形预测的交换性假设（而非传统的IID假设），设计了一种算法来控制不同敏感群体间的覆盖差距。

Result: 实验表明，该算法不仅能控制公平性相关的覆盖差距，还能在理论和实验上保持一致，适用于图数据和表格数据。

Conclusion: 该研究通过“Conformal Fairness”框架，为保形预测提供了一种公平性保障方法，扩展了其在非IID数据中的应用。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic
guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are
agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this
work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using
conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and
associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different
sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption
(implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply
the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such
as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to
demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to
coverage aligned with theoretical expectations.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但推理效率低。本文提出Plan-and-Budget框架，通过动态分配计算资源提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs存在'过度思考'问题，即在简单查询上生成冗长推理，导致计算效率低下。固定计算预算又可能导致'思考不足'。

Method: 提出BBAM理论模型量化推理不确定性，并开发Plan-and-Budget框架：分解问题+自适应预算分配。

Result: 实验显示：最高提升70%准确率，减少39%计算量，E³指标提升187.5%，小模型可媲美大模型效率。

Conclusion: 动态资源分配能显著提升LLMs效率，无需重新训练即可缩小模型性能差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex
reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We
observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where
models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple
queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token
budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder
problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often
stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a
theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models
reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and
introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and
computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose
Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex
queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated
complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning
efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy
gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it
elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger
model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close
performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的不变风险最小化（IRM）方法（如IRMv1）通常采用基于惩罚的单层近似，但在实际应用中往往无法超越经验风险最小化（ERM），表明需要更鲁棒的IRM实现。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于外推的框架，通过合成分布偏移增强IRM惩罚项，从而提升环境多样性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和实际过参数化场景中均优于现有IRM变体，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过增强环境多样性，显著提升了IRM方法的性能，为解决OOD泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM
poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing
approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level
approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods
often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM),
highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work
theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their
penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and
over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this
issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances
environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic
distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups
to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种超越传统消息传递的图神经网络方法G²PM，通过生成式Transformer预训练框架解决现有GNN的局限性，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于消息传递的图神经网络（GNNs）存在表达能力受限、过平滑、过压缩及长距离依赖建模能力不足等问题，限制了其作为图基础模型的可扩展性。

Method: 引入生成式图模式机（G²PM），将图实例表示为子结构序列，并采用生成式预训练学习可泛化、可迁移的表示。

Result: 在ogbn-arxiv基准测试中，G²PM在模型规模达6000万参数时仍持续提升性能，优于先前生成式方法（如300万参数时即停滞）。

Conclusion: G²PM为可扩展的图学习奠定了坚实基础，在节点分类、图分类及迁移学习等任务中均优于基线模型。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by
message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local
neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from
fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness,
over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range
dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model
size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs
as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways
beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine
(G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM
represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of
substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn
generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates
strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with
model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches
that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we
systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural
choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse
tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer
learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a
compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal
data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As
edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple
data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational
tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning
strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment.
Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage
on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these
challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning
(MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal
learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account
for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in
missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive
theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios,
providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing
modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the
Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype
learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results
on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM
compared to benchmarks.

Result: 大量实验表明，NAN能持续提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: NAN是一种简单有效的训练免费模型融合方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Model merging offers a training-free alternative to multi-task learning by
combining independently fine-tuned models into a unified one without access to
raw data. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics to determine
the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this
work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization
and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of
task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we
propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging
coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free,
plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive
experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline
methods.

Conclusion: 研究为理解模型在不准确监督下的鲁棒性提供了理论和实践启示，LIP插件有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Learning from inaccurate annotations has gained significant attention due to
the high cost of precise labeling. However, despite the presence of erroneous
labels, models trained on noisy data often retain the ability to make accurate
predictions. This intriguing phenomenon raises a fundamental yet largely
unexplored question: why models can still extract correct label information
from inaccurate annotations remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive investigation into this issue. By analyzing weight matrices from
both empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy
primarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs
the principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of
weights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned
from clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally
prove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under
moderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize
effectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in
designed to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while
mitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks
with various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances
the performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable
theoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under
inaccurate supervision.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy.
However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and
unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a
robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs
a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with
clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our
approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by
applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them
for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected
during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server
for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for
survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both
data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores
based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index.
Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index
values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL
methods that lack a reputation system.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove directional convergence of network parameters of
fixed width leaky ReLU two-layer neural networks optimized by gradient descent
with exponential loss, which was previously only known for gradient flow. By a
careful analysis of the convergent direction, we establish sufficient
conditions of benign overfitting and discover a new phase transition in the

setting which was studied in prior works. As an application, we demonstrate
that benign overfitting occurs with high probability in sub-Gaussian mixture
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出NQKV算法，通过量化KV缓存至更低比特来减少内存消耗，提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在推理过程中，KV缓存的内存消耗成为部署瓶颈，现有量化方法难以在低比特下保持精度。

Method: 分析KV缓存的元素分布，利用其块内正态分布特性，设计基于分位数量化的NQKV算法实现最优量化误差。

Result: OPT模型在KV缓存量化后，批量大小提升2倍/上下文长度延长4倍，吞吐量相比未量化提升9.3倍。

Conclusion: NQKV算法在几乎不影响输出质量的前提下，显著降低了KV缓存的内存需求并提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across
a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to
enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which
significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV)
cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To
address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach.
Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and
quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To
further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed
the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since
the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution,
NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve
information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly
compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform
inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it
improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

Motivation: 后继表示（SR）在强化学习中受到关注，但其不考虑奖励动态。本文旨在研究一种类似但考虑奖励动态的默认表示（DR），以解决SR的局限性。

Method: 通过动态规划和时间差分方法学习DR，分析其向量空间基础，并将其扩展到函数逼近情况。

Result: 实验表明，DR在奖励塑造、选项发现、探索和迁移学习等应用中，相比SR表现出不同的奖励感知行为和更好的性能。

Conclusion: DR不仅理论上有坚实的基础，实际应用中也优于SR，尤其在考虑奖励动态的场景中表现更佳。

Abstract: In recent years, the successor representation (SR) has attracted increasing
attention in reinforcement learning (RL), and it has been used to address some
of its key challenges, such as exploration, credit assignment, and
generalization. The SR can be seen as representing the underlying credit
assignment structure of the environment by implicitly encoding its induced
transition dynamics. However, the SR is reward-agnostic. In this paper, we
discuss a similar representation that also takes into account the reward
dynamics of the problem. We study the default representation (DR), a recently
proposed representation with limited theoretical (and empirical) analysis.
Here, we lay some of the theoretical foundation underlying the DR in the
tabular case by (1) deriving dynamic programming and (2) temporal-difference
methods to learn the DR, (3) characterizing the basis for the vector space of
the DR, and (4) formally extending the DR to the function approximation case
through default features. Empirically, we analyze the benefits of the DR in
many of the settings in which the SR has been applied, including (1) reward
shaping, (2) option discovery, (3) exploration, and (4) transfer learning. Our
results show that, compared to the SR, the DR gives rise to qualitatively
different, reward-aware behaviour and quantitatively better performance in
several settings.

Conclusion: 呼吁建立开放环境表格基准、多指标评估和通用模块以增强模型鲁棒性，并公开了评估框架。

Abstract: Tabular data, owing to its ubiquitous presence in real-world domains, has
garnered significant attention in machine learning research. While tree-based
models have long dominated tabular machine learning tasks, the recently
proposed deep learning model TabPFN v2 has emerged, demonstrating unparalleled
performance and scalability potential. Although extensive research has been
conducted on TabPFN v2 to further improve performance, the majority of this
research remains confined to closed environments, neglecting the challenges
that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can
TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we
conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open
environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various
real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open
environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that
TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable
for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models
remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To
facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for
open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal
modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation
framework at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tabpfn-ood-4E65.

Conclusion: OGSRL通过双重约束机制，在确保安全的前提下改进了医疗策略，为离线强化学习在医疗领域的应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios,
the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate
generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful
recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL)
attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only
constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This
action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize
short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories,
thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To
safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that
state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline
Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically
grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel
dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety.
First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions
for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions,
it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform
clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without
drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a
safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological
safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where
training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we
provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that
satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve
performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of multi-node perception and delayed
scheduling response in distributed systems by proposing a GNN-based multi-node
collaborative perception mechanism. The system is modeled as a graph structure.
Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph
neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and
dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation
method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves
each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method
is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring
heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used.
Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load
balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions,
including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates
superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The
model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system
states.

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，代理模型可以有效地用于推断大规模模型的行为，尤其在数据归因和数据集选择等应用中。

Abstract: Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet,
in large-scale settings, precisely characterizing how changes in training data
affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Current
practice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxy
models. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger models
identically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scale
models raises the question: how does training data distribution influence model
behavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale language
model predictions (generally) do highly correlate across choice of training
data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scale affects
effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: data attribution and
dataset selection.

Motivation: 传统Bradley-Terry奖励模型（BT RM）存在数据敏感性和奖励破解问题，现有生成式奖励模型（GenRM）因浅层垂直推理难以处理复杂任务，且其成对偏好输出与标准RLHF算法不兼容。

Method: 提出Think-RM框架：1）通过监督微调（SFT）预热模型生成长链思维数据；2）基于规则的强化学习（RL）增强长程推理能力；3）设计成对RLHF流程直接利用偏好奖励优化策略。

Result: Think-RM在RM-Bench上以8%优势超越BT RM和垂直扩展GenRM，结合成对RLHF流程后，终端策略性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Think-RM通过自引导推理和成对RLHF实现了更鲁棒的奖励建模，为复杂任务对齐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful
post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human
preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals,
where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from
sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward
hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by
generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward.
However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting
their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks.
Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF
algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce
Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by
modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured,
externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided
reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection,
hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning
abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over
long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by
rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel
pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise
preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and
enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM
achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and
vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline,
it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional
approaches.

Result: 发现仅大权重能有效防止层坍塌，跳跃连接无法单独解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 大权重是保持注意力机制表现力的关键，计算效率与表现力之间存在固有矛盾。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs).
Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take
quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023]
and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary
unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms
are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid
a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which
means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a
single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for
expressive transformers.
  The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of
rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They
showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip
connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as
justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However,
our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small,
then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip
connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become
standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness
requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects
of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness.
Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and
demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our
results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of
conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data
overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the
ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to
improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem
fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting
experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and
essential call for action.

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多变量时间序列预测方法CAIFormer，通过区分变量间的因果关系来提高预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将所有变量历史数据统一输入模型，难以区分变量间的因果关系，容易混淆相关性与因果性。

Method: 采用all-to-one预测范式，首先构建结构因果模型，然后根据因果结构将历史序列分为四个子段，仅使用因果相关的子段进行预测，并提出了CAIFormer模型。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了CAIFormer的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过区分变量间的因果关系，CAIFormer能够更准确地进行多变量时间序列预测。

Abstract: Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an
all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to
predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles.
However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify
variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant
information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose
an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable
separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from
observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the
historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal
structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious
correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant
sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded.
Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel
forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment
Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider
Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct
causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then
combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

*Yangyang Wang,Jiawei Gu,Li Long,Xin Li,Li Shen,Zhouyu Fu,Xiangjun Zhou,Xu Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FreshRetailNet-50K，首个用于处理销售数据截断问题的大规模基准数据集，通过两阶段需求建模方法显著提升了预测精度并减少了系统偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售业中，准确的需求估计对易腐产品的库存和定价策略至关重要。然而，缺货期间的销售数据截断问题导致未观察到的需求产生系统性偏差，现有数据集缺乏解决这一问题的时序分辨率和标注。

Method: 论文提出两阶段需求建模方法：首先利用精确的小时级标注重建缺货期间的潜在需求，然后利用恢复的需求训练鲁棒的需求预测模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法将预测精度提高了2.73%，并将系统性需求低估从7.37%降至接近零偏差。

Conclusion: FreshRetailNet-50K以其前所未有的时间粒度和全面的真实世界信息，为需求填补、易腐库存优化和零售因果分析开辟了新的研究方向，解决了零售AI中长期存在的限制。

Abstract: Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the
inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces
fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where
unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the
temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To
fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark
for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series
of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing
863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly
stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual
covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal
features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate
one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the
latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then
leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the
second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\%
improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand
underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal
granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens
new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory
optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and
scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing
immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The
data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code
(https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.

TL;DR: AdaSTaR通过自适应采样策略优化自改进语言模型的训练效率与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自改进语言模型训练中存在数据采样不平衡问题，导致对简单样本过度训练而挑战性样本训练不足。

Method: 提出AdaSTaR算法，结合多样性自适应采样和课程自适应采样，动态调整数据难度与模型能力匹配。

Result: 在六个基准测试中均取得最佳准确率，训练FLOPs平均降低58.6%，且泛化性良好。

Conclusion: AdaSTaR为自改进语言模型提供了更高效有效的训练路径。

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of
self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism
often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in
trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples
while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive
STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two
adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting
balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for
Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving
strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all
instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an
extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency
generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for
more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in
many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle
cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this
gap, in this paper, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large
language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five
multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate
the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs
and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM
achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in
molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline
(GPT-4o) by 118.9\% (4.27 vs 1.95 property improvement). The code is publicly

TL;DR: 论文深入分析了差分Transformer的成功因素，并提出DEX方法，将差分注意力的优势高效整合到预训练模型中，显著提升性能且计算轻量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分Transformer虽表现优异，但其成功机制尚不明确，且需从头训练，限制了预训练权重的使用。本研究旨在揭示其优势来源，并提出适配预训练模型的高效方案。

Method: 提出DEX方法：复用预训练模型的注意力分数，仅在输出值矩阵添加轻量差分操作，实现差分注意力的关键优势整合。

Result: DEX在多种基准测试中显著提升预训练LLM性能，仅需极少量适配数据（<0.01%）即可获得明显增益。

Conclusion: 差分注意力的优势源于负注意力增强表达力、减少头冗余和改善学习动态；DEX成功将其轻量化移植到预训练模型中。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its
impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform
noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention
achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover,
Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from
scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three
key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative
attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved
learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to
efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained
language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a
lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively
incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining
lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX
substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving
significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在解析SMILES分子表示时存在困难，无法完成基本任务（如计算分子环数），限制了其在分子科学中的应用。

Method: 提出CLEANMOL框架，将SMILES解析转化为一系列清洁、确定性的任务（如子图匹配和全局图匹配），并构建自适应难度评分的预训练数据集。

Result: CLEANMOL显著提升了LLMs的分子结构理解能力，在Mol-Instructions基准测试中达到或超越基线水平。

Conclusion: CLEANMOL通过结构化任务设计有效解决了LLMs的SMILES解析瓶颈，为分子科学中的LLM应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools
for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental
requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular
structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current
LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such
as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL,
a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and
deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular
comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph
matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural
properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive
difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results
show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves
the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

Motivation: 论文的动机是解决长尾半监督学习（LTSSL）中标记数据与未标记数据分布不匹配的问题。现有方法通常引入辅助分类器（专家）来建模未标记数据的分布并生成伪标签，但未能充分利用不同专家的优势。

Method: 论文提出了动态专家分配模块，根据样本的类别成员（头、中、尾类）动态分配合适的专家以生成高质量的伪标签。此外，还提出了多深度特征融合模块，利用不同深度的特征来减轻模型偏差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、STL-10-LT和SVHN-LT数据集上的综合实验表明，该方法在各种设置下均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 论文通过动态专家分配和多深度特征融合，有效解决了长尾半监督学习中的分布不匹配问题，并展示了其在实际数据集上的优越性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于扩展准可逆排队系统的理论框架，特别是在到达率优化方面，以涵盖更广泛的系统类型，并探索其在优化和强化学习中的潜在应用。

Method: 方法包括重新定义准可逆性以强调客户类别的重要性，引入平衡到达控制策略作为Whittle网络中平衡到达率概念的推广，并分析这些策略对准可逆性的影响。

Result: 结果表明，平衡到达控制策略能够保持准可逆排队系统的准可逆性，并确定了稳态测度的形式。通过重新审视Whittle网络和顺序无关队列这两个经典例子，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结论是提出的方案不仅扩展了准可逆排队系统的理论，还为优化和强化学习框架中的准入控制问题提供了新的解决途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival
rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative
definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights
the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we
introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of
balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the
much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that
supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced
arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the
form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of
quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent
queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our
results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 基于Transformer目标函数的(L0, L1)平滑性观察，提出用动量幅值近似梯度幅值，简化优化器设计。

Method: 使用动量与当前梯度平方加权和的平方根作为分母，无需二阶矩估计，可直接继承AdamW超参数。

Result: 在GPT-2、Llama2（130亿参数）预训练及强化学习任务中表现优异，理论收敛性得到证明。

Conclusion: AdamS凭借效率、简洁性和理论保障，成为现有优化器的有力替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce AdamS, a simple yet effective alternative to Adam for large
language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. By leveraging a novel
denominator, i.e., the root of weighted sum of squares of the momentum and the
current gradient, AdamS eliminates the need for second-moment estimates. Hence,
AdamS is efficient, matching the memory and compute footprint of SGD with
momentum while delivering superior optimization performance. Moreover, AdamS is
easy to adopt: it can directly inherit hyperparameters of AdamW, and is
entirely model-agnostic, integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines without
modifications to optimizer APIs or architectures. The motivation behind AdamS
stems from the observed $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties in transformer
objectives, where local smoothness is governed by gradient magnitudes that can
be further approximated by momentum magnitudes. We establish rigorous
theoretical convergence guarantees and provide practical guidelines for
hyperparameter selection. Empirically, AdamS demonstrates strong performance in
various tasks, including pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2 (up to 13B
parameters) and reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. With its
efficiency, simplicity, and theoretical grounding, AdamS stands as a compelling
alternative to existing optimizers.

Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges,
from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular
space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space.
Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion
model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically
valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative
mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard
benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates
molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current
models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M
million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with
organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated
molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.

Motivation: 现有强化学习任务在训练大语言模型时存在数据生成依赖人工、输出难以验证及缺乏细粒度难度控制三大局限，制约了模型推理能力的有效提升。

Method: 提出基于布尔可满足性问题（SAT）的Saturn框架，通过可扩展的任务构建、基于规则的验证和精确难度控制，设计渐进式课程学习流程。

Result: Saturn-1.5B/7B在SAT问题上pass@3提升14.0/28.1，数学编程任务得分提高4.9/1.8分，优于现有SOTA方法8.8%。

Conclusion: Saturn框架通过SAT问题有效提升LLM推理能力，其可验证、可扩展的特性为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.
Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks)
suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human
annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2)
Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3)
Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control,
making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework
that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM
reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification,
and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline
that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks
of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable
training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying
difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with
problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain
Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT
problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of
+14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B
and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g.,
AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in
constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We
release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型复杂且难以解释，传统嵌入模型缺乏透明度，可解释模型如Tsetlin Machine又受限于扩展性。

Method: 开发Omni TM-AE，利用TM状态矩阵的全部信息，包括之前被排除的子句字面量，通过单次训练构建可重用、可解释的嵌入。

Result: 在语义相似性、情感分类和文档聚类任务中，Omni TM-AE表现优于主流嵌入模型。

Conclusion: Omni TM-AE证明可以在不牺牲性能的情况下，实现NLP系统的可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large-scale language models has amplified
concerns regarding their interpretability and reusability. While traditional
embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe offer scalability, they lack
transparency and often behave as black boxes. Conversely, interpretable models
such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) have shown promise in constructing explainable
learning systems, though they previously faced limitations in scalability and
reusability. In this paper, we introduce Omni Tsetlin Machine AutoEncoder (Omni
TM-AE), a novel embedding model that fully exploits the information contained
in the TM's state matrix, including literals previously excluded from clause
formation. This method enables the construction of reusable, interpretable
embeddings through a single training phase. Extensive experiments across
semantic similarity, sentiment classification, and document clustering tasks
show that Omni TM-AE performs competitively with and often surpasses mainstream
embedding models. These results demonstrate that it is possible to balance
performance, scalability, and interpretability in modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems without resorting to opaque architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了大规模强化学习（RL）如何显著提升中小型模型的推理能力，超越当前基于蒸馏的最先进模型。通过系统研究RL训练过程，提出了一种简单有效的方法：先在数学提示上训练，再在代码提示上训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模强化学习在推理方面取得了进展，但构建高性能推理模型的训练方法仍不明确。前沿模型的关键实现细节（如数据策略和RL训练方法）常被忽略，且研究表明蒸馏对小模型更有效。本文旨在探索RL如何提升中小型模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过广泛的消融实验系统研究RL训练过程，提出了一种简单有效的方法：先在数学提示上训练，再在代码提示上训练。开发了健壮的数据筛选流程，收集具有高质量可验证答案和测试用例的挑战性提示。

Result: 数学RL显著提升了蒸馏模型在数学基准（如AIME 2025上7B/14B模型提升14.6%/17.2%）和代码推理任务（如LiveCodeBench上7B/14B模型提升6.8%/5.8%）上的表现。代码RL进一步提升了代码基准性能，且数学性能几乎不下降。

Conclusion: RL不仅能激发模型在预训练和监督微调中获得的基础推理能力，还能突破其推理极限，解决之前无法解决的问题。课程学习和策略参数更新等方法对训练稳定性有积极影响。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to
generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training
introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor
performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a
framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This
approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such
as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group
to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we
fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue
training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are
conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align
trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level
comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can
inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the
generalization of LLMs.

### [244] [Performance Guaranteed Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning: A Sliding Mode Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16403)
*Huazi Pan,Yanjun Zhang,Leo Yu Zhang,Scott Adams,Abbas Kouzani,Suiyang Khoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedSA的新型联邦学习投毒攻击方法，通过滑动模式控制理论精确控制投毒程度，实现隐蔽且可调的模型破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投毒攻击多导致服务拒绝（DoS）问题，缺乏对攻击程度的精确控制。本文旨在开发一种能按预设目标（如降低全局模型10%准确率）进行隐蔽攻击的方法。

Method: FedSA将非线性控制理论（滑动模式控制SMC）与模型投毒攻击结合，通过恶意客户端更新驱动全局模型至预设状态，并控制收敛边界以实现攻击目标。

Result: 实验表明FedSA能以较少恶意客户端精确达成预设全局准确率，同时保持高隐蔽性和可调学习率。

Conclusion: FedSA为联邦学习投毒攻击提供了精准可控的新范式，揭示了现有防御机制在对抗隐蔽攻击时的潜在脆弱性。

Abstract: Manipulation of local training data and local updates, i.e., the poisoning
attack, is the main threat arising from the collaborative nature of the
federated learning (FL) paradigm. Most existing poisoning attacks aim to
manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS)
issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated
Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the
extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a
predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by
10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from
malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state,
achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging
the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the
convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the
poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious
clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning
rates.

*Zhaoxin Wang,Handing Wang,Cong Tian,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为IJA的新型隐式越狱框架，通过隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，并结合看似无害的文本提示，成功攻击多模态大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的发展，跨模态推理能力增强，但输入空间的扩大也引入了新的攻击面。传统的越狱攻击方法容易被检测和拦截，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击手段。

Method: IJA框架利用最低有效位隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，并结合图像相关的文本提示。此外，通过代理模型生成对抗性后缀，并引入模板优化模块迭代优化提示和嵌入。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5 Pro等商业模型上，该方法平均仅需3次查询即可实现超过90%的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: IJA框架展示了隐式越狱攻击的高效性和隐蔽性，突显了多模态大语言模型在安全性方面的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal
reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack
surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from
text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly
incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit
attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel
implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious
instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples
them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance
attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes
generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module
that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback.
On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack
success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

*Xinxing Shi,Xiaoyu Jiang,Mauricio A. Álvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于邻居驱动的近似策略，用于扩展高斯过程变分自编码器（GPVAE）的可扩展性，通过利用潜在空间的局部邻接关系，减少计算复杂度并保持潜在依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GPVAE方法在大规模数据上计算成本过高，通常依赖限制性核假设或大量诱导点，这限制了模型的灵活性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种邻居驱动的近似策略，通过将计算限制在每个数据点的最近邻范围内，保留关键的潜在依赖关系，从而支持更灵活的核选择和减少诱导点数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在表示学习、数据插补和条件生成等任务中，预测性能和计算效率均优于其他GPVAE变体。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部邻接关系实现了可扩展的GPVAE推断，不仅提升了模型性能，还显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by
replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby
capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact
GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often
forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large
sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven
approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to
achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest
neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent
dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for
numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including
representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we
demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both
predictive performance and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于约束NMF的主题建模方法，通过种子词列表和流行度约束识别少数主题，优于基线方法并在心理健康评论分析中验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题模型难以捕捉低流行度的关键少数主题（如心理健康内容），且现有方法需要过多人工预设，限制主题发现的灵活性。

Method: 使用带种子词列表约束和主题流行度约束的非负矩阵分解（NMF），通过KKT条件和乘法更新进行优化。

Result: 在合成数据上主题纯度和互信息指标优于基线，并在YouTube评论案例中成功识别出心理健康相关少数主题。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预设主题划分即可有效挖掘数据驱动的少数主题，同时保留多数主题的发现能力。

Abstract: Topic models often fail to capture low-prevalence, domain-critical themes,
so-called minority topics, such as mental health themes in online comments.
While some existing methods can incorporate domain knowledge, such as expected
topical content, methods allowing guidance may require overly detailed expected
topics, hindering the discovery of topic divisions and variation. We propose a
topic modeling solution via a specially constrained NMF. We incorporate a seed
word list characterizing minority content of interest, but we do not require
experts to pre-specify their division across minority topics. Through
prevalence constraints on minority topics and seed word content across topics,
we learn distinct data-driven minority topics as well as majority topics. The
constrained NMF is fitted via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with
multiplicative updates. We outperform several baselines on synthetic data in
terms of topic purity, normalized mutual information, and also evaluate topic
quality using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). We conduct a case study on
YouTube vlog comments, analyzing viewer discussion of mental health content;
our model successfully identifies and reveals this domain-relevant minority
content.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在训练数据包含更丰富标签（如个体类型、排名或风险估计）的情况下，公平性与效用和效率的关系，提出了实现更强证据公平性的算法，并展示了在某些情况下同时实现准确分类率和最优损失最小化的计算不可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是探讨在训练数据包含更丰富标签（而不仅仅是二元结果）的情况下，如何实现公平性、效用和效率的平衡。传统监督学习中的公平性定义可能不足以应对这些复杂场景，因此需要更强的公平性概念和算法。

Method: 本文提出了新的算法，支持分类和排名技术，以保持准确的子群体分类率，同时实现损失最小化。这些算法适用于广泛的分类规则和下游应用。此外，本文还通过计算不可行性结果，展示了在某些情况下同时实现准确分类率和最优损失最小化的难度。

Result: 本文的结果表明，虽然贝叶斯最优预测器可以同时满足准确分类率和最优损失最小化，但在某些情况下，学习一个足够好的近似预测器是计算不可行的。因此，需要在两种自然的、可实现的准确性概念之间做出选择，这两种概念都可以由公平性驱动。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是，在复杂标签场景下，公平性与效用和效率的平衡需要更强的算法支持。虽然某些理想目标在计算上不可行，但通过高效学习可以单独实现这些目标。这为公平性研究提供了新的方向和挑战。

Abstract: We revisit the foundations of fairness and its interplay with utility and
efficiency in settings where the training data contain richer labels, such as
individual types, rankings, or risk estimates, rather than just binary
outcomes. In this context, we propose algorithms that achieve stronger notions
of evidence-based fairness than are possible in standard supervised learning.
Our methods support classification and ranking techniques that preserve
accurate subpopulation classification rates, as suggested by the underlying
data distributions, across a broad class of classification rules and downstream
applications. Furthermore, our predictors enable loss minimization, whether
aimed at maximizing utility or in the service of fair treatment.
  Complementing our algorithmic contributions, we present impossibility results
demonstrating that simultaneously achieving accurate classification rates and
optimal loss minimization is, in some cases, computationally infeasible. Unlike
prior impossibility results, our notions are not inherently in conflict and are
simultaneously satisfied by the Bayes-optimal predictor. Furthermore, we show
that each notion can be satisfied individually via efficient learning. Our
separation thus stems from the computational hardness of learning a
sufficiently good approximation of the Bayes-optimal predictor. These
computational impossibilities present a choice between two natural and
attainable notions of accuracy that could both be motivated by fairness.

TL;DR: 本文提出PKeX-Shapley算法，利用乘积核的乘法结构实现Shapley值的多项式时间精确计算，提升核方法的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法因其灵活性和强大表达能力被广泛应用，但其黑箱特性导致可解释性差，限制了在高风险场景的应用。现有基于Shapley值的特征归因方法（如SHAP）计算复杂度高，亟需高效精确的解决方案。

Method: 提出PKeX-Shapley算法：通过乘积核的函数分解特性，建立Shapley值的递归计算公式，实现多项式时间内的精确求解。该方法可推广至MMD和HSIC等核统计量的解释。

Result: 算法在保持计算效率的同时，为乘积核模型提供精确的Shapley值解释，并成功扩展到核统计差异度的可解释性分析。

Conclusion: PKeX-Shapley为核方法提供了兼具计算效率与数学严谨性的解释工具，推动了可解释机器学习在统计推断中的应用。

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility
and expressive power. However, their black-box nature poses significant
challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes
applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP
and kernel-specific variants like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward
explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values remains computationally
intractable in general, motivating the development of various approximation
schemes. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that
utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact
computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. We show that product-kernel
models admit a functional decomposition that allows for a recursive formulation
of Shapley values. This decomposition not only yields computational efficiency
but also enhances interpretability in kernel-based learning. We also
demonstrate how our framework can be generalized to explain kernel-based
statistical discrepancies such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thus offering new tools for
interpretable statistical inference.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无顺序约束的图条件关系扩散模型（GRDM），通过图神经网络联合建模关系数据库中的所有表，显著提升了多表关联建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于单表生成或固定顺序的自回归建模，导致并行性差、灵活性不足且误差累积。需要突破顺序限制以更好地捕捉表间复杂依赖关系。

Method: 使用图结构表示关系数据库，基于图神经网络开发GRDM模型，通过联合去噪行属性和建模跨表依赖实现无顺序约束的生成。

Result: 在6个真实数据库上的实验表明，GRDM在多跳表间关联建模上显著优于自回归基线，单表生成质量达到SOTA。

Conclusion: GRDM通过图结构建模突破了传统顺序生成的限制，为关系数据库生成提供了更灵活、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for
applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets.
However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on
autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate
tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in
downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due
to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a
fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without
imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose
the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph
neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex
inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive
baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: HOFT和SHOFT在保持高效的同时，显著提升了正交微调的性能，为模型适配提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Adaptation of foundation models using low-rank methods is a widespread
approach. Another way to adapt these models is to employ orthogonal fine-tuning
methods, which are less time and memory efficient despite their good
generalization properties. In this work, we propose Householder Orthogonal
Fine-tuning (HOFT), a novel orthogonal fine-tuning method that aims to
alleviate time and space complexity. Moreover, some theoretical properties of
the orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm are explored. From this exploration, Scaled
Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (SHOFT) is proposed. Both HOFT and SHOFT are
evaluated in downstream tasks, namely commonsense reasoning, machine
translation, subject-driven generation and mathematical reasoning. Compared
with state-of-the-art adaptation methods, HOFT and SHOFT show comparable or
better results.

Motivation: 解决增量序列分类问题，即在序列元素逐步揭示时更新预测，需要满足时间一致性条件以提高预测的准确性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过时间一致性条件和新型损失函数，该方法显著提升了增量序列分类的性能，尤其在早期观察少量标记时能更好地区分有希望和无希望的生成结果。

Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where
predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing
on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a
temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We
leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training
incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate
that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We
apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves
predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We
further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model
generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show
that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising
generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.

Conclusion: 通过外微积分框架，本文实现了“空间解放”的偏微分方程学习，显著提升了模型在不同空间环境中的适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial
differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of
spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in.
This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to
other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate-
and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call
``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning
approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the
formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately
generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the
performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley
reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by
in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical
experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions
across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one
space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different
dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

Motivation: 当前边缘设备上的模型训练存在数据利用率低的问题，主要由于训练吞吐量低、存储有限和数据重要性多样。为提升数据资源利用率，需要一种高效且有效的数据选择方法。

Method: Titan采用两阶段数据选择框架：第一阶段粗粒度筛选高重要性候选数据集；第二阶段细粒度选择最优数据批次以提升模型性能。此外，通过流水线并行执行数据选择和模型训练，并利用空闲计算资源避免冲突。

Result: 实验表明，Titan在真实边缘设备上实现了高达43%的训练时间减少和6.2%的最终精度提升，且系统开销（如数据处理延迟、内存占用和能耗）较小。

Conclusion: Titan通过高效的数据选择和资源利用策略，显著提升了边缘设备上模型训练的效率和效果，为数据隐私和个性化服务需求提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is
escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we
observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the
under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited
storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we
propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most
important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed
efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan}
filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a
coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose
a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with
the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further
enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to
co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by
exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge
devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and
data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to
$43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with
minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and
energy consumption.

Motivation: 当前普遍认为微调LLM是一个安全可控的过程，但本文首次证明攻击者可以通过特定手段植入后门，使模型在微调后表现出恶意行为，挑战了关于微调安全性的现有假设。

Method: 提出FAB攻击方法，利用元学习技术模拟下游微调过程，优化模型在微调后表现出恶意行为的能力，同时保持微调前的正常表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调LLM时的新攻击途径，强调了在开放模型生态系统中加强安全措施的必要性。

Abstract: Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard
practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now,
finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which
training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we
demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that
initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by
downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated
Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream
finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in
the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to
retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to
finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on
their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target
behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability.
Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning
choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our
findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning,
revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of
LLMs.

Abstract: The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting
more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting
methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods
offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of
forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and
apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial
intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience
and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent
breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to
address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration
framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A
set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the
forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism.
This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting
pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling
the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the
interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users
provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the
framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 通过策略集成和多样化数据蒸馏，可以显著提升零样本策略迁移的泛化能力，为相关研究提供了实用指导。

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal
is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can
generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has
shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy
that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not
yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the
policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation
bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical
insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of
distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training
environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in
more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer
hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a
diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

TL;DR: 研究表明，使用合理反事实解释（p-CFEs）训练分类器比对抗性扰动更有效，不仅能保持高准确率，还能减少虚假相关性带来的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过合理反事实解释（p-CFEs）训练分类器，以改变其决策并减少数据分布中的偏差，扩展了此前对抗性扰动的研究。

Method: 使用标记为诱导错误目标类的p-CFEs训练分类器，使其在未扰动输入上仍能正确分类原始标签。

Result: 实验显示，基于p-CFEs训练的分类器不仅保持了高准确率，还显著降低了由虚假相关性引起的偏差。

Conclusion: 合理反事实解释（p-CFEs）是一种有效的训练方法，能够提升分类器性能并减少偏差。

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that
minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining
plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that
classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect}
target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While
previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial
perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our
experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the
resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also
exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields
where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate
these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic,
low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these
limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible
data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical
causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from
thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as
two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms for graph reconstruction on
systems with noisy, confounded, and lagged dynamics. CausalDynamics consists of
a plug-and-play, build-your-own coupling workflow that enables the construction
of a hierarchy of physical systems. We anticipate that our framework will
facilitate the development of robust causal discovery algorithms that are
broadly applicable across domains while addressing their unique challenges. We
provide a user-friendly implementation and documentation on

### [260] [Multivariate Latent Recalibration for Conditional Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16636)
*Victor Dheur,Souhaib Ben Taieb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的潜在校准概念和潜在重新校准（LR）方法，用于改进多变量响应变量的条件分布建模，确保概率密度函数的准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多变量模型可能存在误设或校准不足的问题，导致预测不可靠和决策次优。标准校准方法仅适用于单变量场景，而保形预测技术无法提供完整的概率密度函数。

Method: 论文首先引入潜在校准的概念，评估条件归一化流潜在空间中的概率校准；其次提出潜在重新校准（LR）方法，通过学习潜在空间的变换来优化校准。

Result: 实验表明，LR能显著降低潜在校准误差和负对数似然，提升模型性能。

Conclusion: LR方法在多变量建模中有效且高效，为决策提供了更可靠的分布估计。

Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate
response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may
yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables,
leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore,
standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings,
while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate
prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability
density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of
latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent
space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent
recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a
transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent
calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution
with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that
LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative
log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.

TL;DR: 论文通过理论和实证分析表明，无意识公平性(FtU)可在不降低准确性的情况下减少算法歧视，并建议在高风险场景中考虑使用FtU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨无意识公平性(FtU)是否真如批评者所言无法确保公平，并验证其在实际应用中的潜在价值。

Method: 结合理论分析和实证研究，联系模型多重性(Model Multiplicity)文献，并提供新的理论和实证结果。

Result: FtU能有效减少算法歧视且不一定牺牲准确性，实际案例中可推动更公平政策的实施而不损失效能。

Conclusion: FtU值得在实际应用中考虑，尤其在高风险场景；使用性别等敏感属性需有明确理由。

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination
against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership
in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the
machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In
addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the
accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to
be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and
empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily
reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model
Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical
results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can
contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing
efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical
applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of
protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied
by a clear and well-founded justification.

Motivation: 现有基于能量的前向-前向算法忽略神经元间相关性，且依赖负样本。本文旨在开发更生物可信、适合神经形态计算的学习方法。

Method: 提出有效维度压缩作为新的'goodness'函数，最小化含噪输入的有效维度，最大化样本分布的有效维度，无需负样本。

Result: 该方法在非反向传播算法中表现竞争力，噪声通过能量项预测可增强泛化能力和推理性能。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了生物可信学习算法发展，特别适合利用随机性作为计算资源的神经形态计算。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to
backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise
"goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by
energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared
post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this
work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression
that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to
incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for
clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample
distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare
negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive
performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise
plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference
when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is
equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings
contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning
algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where
stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance. The code is

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for
enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational
efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a
RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles
to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both
a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the
signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on
current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current,
these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a
delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous
cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a
hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential
Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to
capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies
while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model
is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning
strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the
model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target
data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning
approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data exhibits high dimensionality, noise, and
intricate feature entanglement, presenting significant challenges for
traditional clustering algorithms. In this study, we conduct a comparative
analysis of three clustering approaches: (1) Classical K-Means Clustering,
applied to pre-processed feature representations; (2) Hybrid Clustering,
wherein classical features are enhanced with quantum random features extracted
using randomly initialized quantum neural networks (QNNs); and (3) Fully
Quantum Clustering, where a QNN is trained in a self-supervised manner
leveraging a SwAV-based loss function to optimize the feature space for
clustering directly. The proposed experimental framework systematically
investigates the impact of quantum circuit depth and the number of learned
prototypes, demonstrating that even shallow quantum circuits can effectively
extract meaningful non-linear representations, significantly improving
clustering performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在训练过程中会学习到伪相关性，这导致其在分布外泛化能力下降。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升SSL的OOD性能。

Method: 提出基于结构因果模型的干预后分布(PID)，并设计了一种批量采样策略，通过潜在变量模型学习来强制满足PID约束。

Result: 理论分析证明了潜在变量模型的可识别性，实验验证了所提采样策略在多种下游OOD任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过PID和批量采样策略，可以有效减少SSL中的伪相关性，从而提升模型在分布外场景下的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of
self-supervised learning (SSL). By analyzing the mini-batch construction during
the SSL training phase, we first give one plausible explanation for SSL having
OOD generalization. Then, from the perspective of data generation and causal
inference, we analyze and conclude that SSL learns spurious correlations during
the training process, which leads to a reduction in OOD generalization. To
address this issue, we propose a post-intervention distribution (PID) grounded
in the Structural Causal Model. PID offers a scenario where the spurious
variable and label variable is mutually independent. Besides, we demonstrate
that if each mini-batch during SSL training satisfies PID, the resulting SSL
model can achieve optimal worst-case OOD performance. This motivates us to
develop a batch sampling strategy that enforces PID constraints through the
learning of a latent variable model. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate the identifiability of the latent variable model and validate the
effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy. Experiments conducted on
various downstream OOD tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
sampling strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组测序产生的短序列（reads）需要重新组装以重建完整基因组，传统方法复杂且耗时。本文旨在开发一种无需完整基因组组装即可分析测序数据的方法。

Method: 使用对比学习训练编码器模型，生成能够反映基因组结构的k-mer序列嵌入表示。方法支持有监督和无监督学习，并可结合噪声模型增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在E. coli基因组和模拟古DNA数据上验证了方法的有效性，在短基因组上的性能与当前黄金标准BWA-aln相当，且适用于宏基因组物种鉴定。

Conclusion: 该方法具有良好的扩展性，适用于宏基因组和大基因组（如人类基因组）分析，为基因组测序数据提供了一种高效且通用的表示学习框架。

Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous
number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be
reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing
this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is
trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same
genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the
form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect
the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general
representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks
involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\
coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read
mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate
the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species
identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can
enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting
can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a
distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully
self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a
full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based
on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the
current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and
runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with
respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising
for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to
the human genome.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练的大型语言模型（PoLM）常因过度自信而影响关键应用的可靠性，且下游任务的标注数据稀缺，导致校准困难。

Method: 提出DACA方法，通过仅使用PLM和PoLM预测一致的样本进行温度缩放校准，避免因分歧样本导致的欠自信问题。

Result: 实验表明，DACA显著提升了开源和API基础LLM（如GPT-4o）的校准性能，平均ECE改善达15.08%。

Conclusion: DACA有效解决了PoLM的校准问题，为无监督校准提供了新思路，提升了模型可靠性。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.
While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language
models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to
both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical
applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled
data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose
Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to
optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence
calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by
prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their
confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence
underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a
larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by
selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively
decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an
overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,
improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and
API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型通过将预测分解为人类可解释的概念来确保可解释性，但训练这些模型的标注数据往往存在噪声，且噪声对模型的影响尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架：在训练阶段使用锐度感知最小化（sharpness-aware minimization）来稳定对噪声敏感概念的学习；在推理阶段通过预测熵对概念进行排序，并仅校正最不确定的概念，以不确定性作为易受噪声影响概念的代理。

Result: 研究表明，即使是中等程度的噪声也会同时损害预测性能、可解释性和干预效果。提出的方法通过理论分析和广泛实验验证了其有效性，能够保持模型在噪声存在下的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文通过系统分析和提出的两阶段框架，为概念瓶颈模型在噪声环境下的稳健性和可解释性提供了理论基础和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing
predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for
training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of
such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first
systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption
simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the
intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of
concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy
and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss.
To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During
training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of
noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable,
we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain
ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and
extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness
and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a
principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the
presence of noise.

TL;DR: 提出SeCO和SpaCO两种内存高效训练方法，显著提升长上下文LLM的训练效率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型训练成本过高，限制了定制化应用。

Method: SeCO将长输入分块独立计算，SpaCO在此基础上选择性传播梯度并引入补偿因子。

Result: SeCO将序列长度从1K扩展到16K，SpaCO训练速度比SeCO快3倍。

Conclusion: 这些创新使长上下文模型更实用，代码已开源。

Abstract: While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document
processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder
customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textit{Sequential
Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that
partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently
constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation,
ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory.
Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization}
(SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating
gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation
factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the
computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling
training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become
longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer
substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with
LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to
16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up
to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations
provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more
accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at
\href{https://github.com/wenhaoli-xmu/seco}{here}.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models
have shown great promise, driving progress in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
and healthcare applications. However, despite their success, many existing
pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content
of neural oscillations, a limitation that fundamentally constrains their
performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is
frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain
their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an
enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled
improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++
demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently
outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive
results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and
training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future
advancements in LBMs.

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and
contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally.
computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which
hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a
novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with
sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse
conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various
sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition,
we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as
numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational
autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the
applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point
clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data
can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation
quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

Conclusion: 该方法通过内生的信息收集机制，有效解决了部分可观察环境下的探索与利用问题，无需额外探索奖励或人工启发式规则。

Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to
balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate
objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts
policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac
model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by
anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration
bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we
develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently
estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal
trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative
modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled
forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through
a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative
framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential
equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion
functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean
data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target
distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained
using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step
non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its
simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned
(e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generative modelling. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于通过简化策略、表示和目标来增强强化学习的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种改进的强化学习问题，最大化诱导轨迹内的总相关性，并基于下界近似优化所有模型。

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中，该方法生成了周期性且可压缩的轨迹策略，表现出更强的抗噪声和动态变化能力，同时提升了原始任务性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大化轨迹相关性，该方法有效提升了强化学习策略的简单性、鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning,
regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler
representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that,
with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by
focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate
how to promote simple behavior throughout the episode. To that end, we
introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem that
additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories.
We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy
and state representation, based on a lower-bound approximation. In simulated
robot environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce
periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to
noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also
improving performance in the original tasks.

### [275] [Backward Oversmoothing: why is it hard to train deep Graph Neural Networks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16736)
*Nicolas Keriven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络（GNN）中的过度平滑问题，特别是从优化角度分析了反向传播中的过度平滑现象及其对梯度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN中的过度平滑问题长期以来被认为是其主要限制之一，即节点特征在每一层被平滑并最终收敛到无信息的表示。然而，实践中GNN并未真正学会避免过度平滑，这促使作者从优化角度重新审视这一问题。

Method: 论文分析了反向过度平滑现象，即反向传播误差从输出到输入也会受到平滑影响。通过非线性激活函数，作者探讨了前向平滑与反向平滑之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究表明，由于反向过度平滑，GNN存在许多虚假的驻点，导致梯度接近零而损失仍然很高。此外，这种现象在深层GNN中尤为明显，而多层感知机（MLP）则不受此影响。

Conclusion: 该论文为理解GNN特有的优化景观迈出了重要一步，揭示了反向过度平滑对梯度下降的负面影响，并指出了这一现象的独特性。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to
a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently
bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are
sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could
thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice,
which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view.
In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that
backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to
oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we
outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing.
Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit
many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the
whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where
gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact
that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear
oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that
the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that
this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete
comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种安全感知探测（SAP）优化框架，用于缓解大语言模型（LLM）在微调过程中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在预训练阶段实施了安全对齐技术，但研究发现，即使在非有害数据上进行微调，仍可能导致LLM的安全性能下降。

Method: SAP框架在梯度传播过程中引入安全感知探测，识别梯度方向的潜在风险，从而在提升任务性能的同时保护模型安全性。

Result: 实验结果表明，SAP能有效降低模型的有害性，同时保持与标准微调方法相当的测试损失。

Conclusion: SAP框架成功解决了微调过程中的安全退化问题，为LLM的安全应用提供了有效保障。

Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to
remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to
generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the
implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase,
recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign
data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine
the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in
safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization
framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs.
Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient
propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by
identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing
task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our
extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces
harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test
loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at

Method: 结合基于模型的元学习方法，交替执行集成模型学习和梯度元策略学习，在高维非线性动力学系统中实现最小注意力控制。

Result: 实验表明，最小注意力机制在少样本快速适应、降低模型与环境扰动方差方面优于当前主流模型无关/基于模型的RL算法，且能效显著提升。

Conclusion: 最小注意力原则能有效提升强化学习的适应性和稳定性，为生物控制模拟及高效RL算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of
control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved
regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as
motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as
part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and
stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention
is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model
learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed.
Empirically, we show that the minimum attention does show outperforming
competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in model-free and
model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from
the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum
attention demonstrates the improvement in energy efficiency.

Abstract: As Kalyan T. Talluri and Garrett J. Van Ryzin describe in their work [3],

quantity for the sale of airline tickets on a direct flight over a certain
number of time periods. More specifically, we will only focus on the
optimization aspect of this problem. We will assume the demand data to be
given, since Air France estimates it beforehand using real data. Similarly, we
assume all price options to be predetermined by Air France's algorithms and
verified by their analysts. Our objective will be to maximize the revenue of a
direct flight by choosing the prices for each product from the predefined set
of options.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习依赖于预收集的数据集，但目前缺乏支持用户自定义或新基准数据集的标准化和可扩展解决方案。

Method: 引入PyTupli，一个包含轻量级客户端库和容器化服务器组件的工具，支持数据集的上传、检索和精细过滤。

Conclusion: PyTupli通过解决数据集基础设施的关键障碍，推动了离线强化学习研究的协作性、可复现性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful
paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the
need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries
offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on
datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state,
and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires
suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established
benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing
and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap,
we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage,
and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple
datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces
for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained
filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate
high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables
production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated
certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset
infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and
scalable offline RL research.

Conclusion: 提出的MOGP方法为图结构数据回归提供了更通用和灵活的解决方案，扩展了现有高斯过程方法的应用范围。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a
graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data
correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data,
which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the
correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The
proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be
applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has
high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes
existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special
cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model
selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of
extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer
experiments with synthetic and real data.

Abstract: We introduce FlowMixer, a neural architecture that leverages constrained
matrix operations to model structured spatiotemporal patterns. At its core,
FlowMixer incorporates non-negative matrix mixing layers within a reversible
mapping framework-applying transforms before mixing and their inverses
afterward. This shape-preserving design enables a Kronecker-Koopman eigenmode
framework that bridges statistical learning with dynamical systems theory,
providing interpretable spatiotemporal patterns and facilitating direct
algebraic manipulation of prediction horizons without retraining. Extensive
experiments across diverse domains demonstrate FlowMixer's robust long-horizon
forecasting capabilities while effectively modeling physical phenomena such as
chaotic attractors and turbulent flows. These results suggest that
architectural constraints can simultaneously enhance predictive performance and
mathematical interpretability in neural forecasting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在离散数据建模中表现优异，但在分子生成领域潜力尚未充分挖掘。研究发现，直接应用标准掩码扩散模型会导致性能严重下降，主要原因是不同分子在前向扩散过程中会坍缩到相同状态，造成目标混合问题。

Method: 提出Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD)方法，通过参数化噪声调度网络为每个图元素（原子和键）分配不同的损坏率，避免分子图之间的状态冲突。

Result: 实验表明，MELD显著提升生成质量：在ZINC250K数据集上将化学有效性从15%提升至93%，并在条件生成任务中达到SOTA属性对齐效果。

Conclusion: MELD通过元素级噪声调度有效解决了分子生成中的状态冲突问题，为掩码扩散模型在分子生成领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling
discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains
underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the
surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the
performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing
problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a
common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be
learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To
mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that
orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between
distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise
scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph
elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular
benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality
compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity
of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves
state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Method: 结合生成式填补（估算缺失模态）和判别式建模（评估采集收益），提出基于群体的主动模态采集框架CAMA，并设计性能上限启发式基准。

Result: 实验表明，基于填补的策略优于单模态信息、熵引导和随机选择方法，能更有效指导群体层面的模态采集。

Conclusion: CAMA为资源受限场景提供了群体级模态采集优化方案，通过智能选择关键样本提升资源利用率。

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple
modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions.
However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every
sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the
question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality
acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored
individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning
paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite
their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active
Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the
challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We
derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative
imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of
acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also
introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark
acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate
that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the
acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal
information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an
effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level,
enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

Motivation: 随着严肃游戏（SGs）越来越多地采用程序化内容生成（PCG）技术来提升玩家体验，开发一个评估PCG技术对SGs影响的框架变得尤为重要。然而，这一开发过程面临诸多挑战。

Method: 研究提出了一种自动化评估PCG集成到SGs中的方法，结合了深度强化学习（DRL）游戏测试代理。通过一个包含卡牌游戏机制的SG案例，测试了三种不同PCG版本（随机生成和两种遗传算法生成）对框架代理的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于遗传算法（版本2和3）训练的DRL代理在胜率和训练时间上均优于随机生成（版本1）的代理，胜率最高达到97%，且统计显著性更高（p=0.009）。

Conclusion: 该框架能够为评估SGs中的程序化生成内容提供有意义的数据，证明了其在PCG技术评估中的有效性。

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content
generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized
and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to
assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains
particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated
evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously
introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different
versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed.
Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a
genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of
different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The
obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents
trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win
rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More
specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both
Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically
significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1
that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's
capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally
generated content in SGs.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习随机优化问题的ε-最优策略，适用于多种强单调和稳定的优化问题。

Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning
from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution
can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample
consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding
real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn
an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy
distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds
for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization
problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample
complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone
and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization,
Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.

Abstract: Long-term planning, as in reinforcement learning (RL), involves finding
strategies: actions that collectively work toward a goal rather than
individually optimizing their immediate outcomes. As part of a strategy, some
actions are taken at the expense of short-term benefit to enable future actions
with even greater returns. These actions are only advantageous if followed up
by the actions they facilitate, consequently, they would not have been taken if
those follow-ups were not available. In this paper, we quantify such
dependencies between planned actions with strategic link scores: the drop in
the likelihood of one decision under the constraint that a follow-up decision
is no longer available. We demonstrate the utility of strategic link scores
through three practical applications: (i) explaining black-box RL agents by
identifying strategically linked pairs among decisions they make, (ii)
improving the worst-case performance of decision support systems by
distinguishing whether recommended actions can be adopted as standalone
improvements or whether they are strategically linked hence requiring a
commitment to a broader strategy to be effective, and (iii) characterizing the
planning processes of non-RL agents purely through interventions aimed at
measuring strategic link scores - as an example, we consider a realistic
traffic simulator and analyze through road closures the effective planning
horizon of the emergent routing behavior of many drivers.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants.
As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its
practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key
dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In
this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated
learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and
Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,
task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We
have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation
to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable
environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in
FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench
lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated
learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly
accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments
and research in the FL literature.

### [288] [Efficient Online RL Fine Tuning with Offline Pre-trained Policy Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16856)
*Wei Xiao,Jiacheng Liu,Zifeng Zhuang,Runze Suo,Shangke Lyu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出PORL方法，仅利用离线预训练策略进行在线强化学习微调，避免依赖预训练Q函数，提升探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线RL微调方法依赖离线预训练的Q函数，但其保守性会限制探索能力，且无法适用于仅有预训练策略（如模仿学习）的场景。

Method: PORL（Policy-Only RL Fine-Tuning）在在线阶段从零快速初始化Q函数，避免悲观估计的负面影响。

Result: PORL性能媲美先进离线-在线RL算法，并首次实现直接微调行为克隆（BC）策略。

Conclusion: PORL为无需预训练Q函数的在线RL微调提供了新思路，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online
reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing
online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline
pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline
pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the
offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which
hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online
setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios
where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are
absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these
challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using
solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained
Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning
Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the
online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and
online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a
new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增量聚类的联邦学习方法IC-SYSID，用于解决多数据源系统辨识问题，无需先验知识，并通过实验验证了其高效性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习框架下多数据源系统辨识(SYSID)问题，消除对数据集先验知识的依赖，提升模型稳定性。

Method: 提出IC-SYSID算法，结合增量聚类方法ClusterCraft动态分配相似本地节点，引入ClusterMerge合并相似聚类，并采用正则化损失函数和Glorot初始化提升稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，IC-SYSID在真实车辆动力学学习场景中实现了高性能系统辨识，同时避免了不稳定聚类的生成。

Conclusion: IC-SYSID有效解决了联邦学习中多源SYSID问题，兼具高效性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the System Identification (SYSID) problem within the
framework of federated learning. We introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental
Clustering-based federated learning method for SYSID (IC-SYSID), designed to
tackle SYSID challenges across multiple data sources without prior knowledge.
IC-SYSID utilizes an incremental clustering method, ClusterCraft (CC), to
eliminate the dependency on the prior knowledge of the dataset. CC starts with
a single cluster model and assigns similar local workers to the same clusters
by dynamically increasing the number of clusters. To reduce the number of
clusters generated by CC, we introduce ClusterMerge, where similar cluster
models are merged. We also introduce enhanced ClusterCraft to reduce the
generation of similar cluster models during the training. Moreover, IC-SYSID
addresses cluster model instability by integrating a regularization term into
the loss function and initializing cluster models with scaled Glorot
initialization. It also utilizes a mini-batch deep learning approach to manage
large SYSID datasets during local training. Through the experiments conducted
on a real-world representing SYSID problem, where a fleet of vehicles
collaboratively learns vehicle dynamics, we show that IC-SYSID achieves a high
SYSID performance while preventing the learning of unstable clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出GCAL方法，通过双层优化策略解决图域自适应中的持续学习和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升模型适应性和知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图域自适应方法局限于单步适应，无法处理连续域偏移且易受灾难性遗忘影响。本文旨在提升模型在多图域中的可持续性和适应性。

Method: GCAL采用双层优化策略：'适应'阶段通过信息最大化微调模型并重适应历史记忆；'生成记忆'阶段基于信息瓶颈理论生成变分记忆图以压缩原始图。

Result: 大量实验表明，GCAL在适应性和知识保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GCAL有效解决了动态多图域的持续自适应问题，为图域自适应领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of graph domain adaptation on evolving,
multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Conventional graph domain adaptation
methods are confined to single-step adaptation, making them ineffective in
handling continuous domain shifts and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This
paper introduces the Graph Continual Adaptive Learning (GCAL) method, designed
to enhance model sustainability and adaptability across various graph domains.
GCAL employs a bilevel optimization strategy. The "adapt" phase uses an
information maximization approach to fine-tune the model with new graph domains
while re-adapting past memories to mitigate forgetting. Concurrently, the
"generate memory" phase, guided by a theoretical lower bound derived from
information bottleneck theory, involves a variational memory graph generation
module to condense original graphs into memories. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that GCAL substantially outperforms existing methods in
terms of adaptability and knowledge retention.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估框架，分析不同预处理步骤与机器学习模型在IoT异常检测中的交互作用，发现GBoosting在多数情况下表现最佳，而RNN-LSTM和自编码器在特定预处理下各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备的迅速增加，异常检测的安全性挑战日益突出。尽管已有许多研究提出机器学习方法，但缺乏对预处理步骤与不同模型架构交互作用的系统分析。

Method: 本文采用多步评估框架，结合归一化、转换和特征选择等预处理步骤，评估了RNN-LSTM、自编码器神经网络和梯度提升（GBoosting）三种机器学习算法在IoTID20数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，GBoosting在各种预处理配置下均表现最佳；RNN-LSTM在z-score归一化下表现显著提升；自编码器在召回率上表现优异，尤其适合无监督场景。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析预处理选择与不同机器学习技术的交互作用，本文提出的框架为提升物联网环境中的异常检测性能提供了实用指导。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced
critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly
detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML)
methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how
different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature
selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap,
this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined
impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder
neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the
IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy
across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with
z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited
for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing
decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed
framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance
in IoT environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过对比学习和结构预测任务，将蛋白质图神经网络的结构知识融入蛋白质语言模型的双任务框架，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质语言模型（pLMs）虽然在多种下游任务中表现优异，但缺乏对蛋白质结构知识的理解，而结构知识在许多生物应用中至关重要。

Method: 论文提出了一种双任务框架：1）通过对比学习任务将pGNNs的结构知识对齐到pLMs中；2）通过预测结构标记的任务注入蛋白质内部结构知识。此外，还引入了残差损失选择模块来优化学习过程。

Result: 该方法应用于ESM2和AMPLIFY模型后，在多种任务中取得了显著性能提升，例如ESM2的接触预测准确率提高了12.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将蛋白质间和蛋白质内的结构知识整合到pLMs中，显著提升了模型性能，相关数据和模型已在Hugging Face上发布。

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases
excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential
for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural
insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs
through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue
representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins,
enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we
incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural
knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed
dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and
intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the
quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss
selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures
to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn.
Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and
AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks,
including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and
resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.

Motivation: 现有的GNN提示方法依赖标签数据和轻量微调，而大型语言模型的上下文学习展示了无需参数更新和标签数据的潜力。本文旨在探索GNN在无监督和参数固定条件下的提示方法。

Method: 提出基于一致性正则化的无监督提示方法，通过伪标签技术和两种正则化手段对齐分布并减少预测偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该无监督方法在协变量偏移条件下优于需要标签数据的现有提示方法。

Conclusion: 无监督提示方法能有效提升预训练GNN的泛化能力，为GNN的提示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to
address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However,
existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight
fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter
updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this
work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting
methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained
GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating
the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully
unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through
pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted
graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions.
Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that
our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods
that have access to labels.

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)
methods and introduces an experimental framework for scalable, interpretable
offer selection, addressing the challenge of fast-changing offers. The approach
models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple
categories and enabling knowledge transfer across similar offers. This improves
learning efficiency and generalization in dynamic environments. The framework
extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and
achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design.
Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix
Factorization) capture nuanced user-offer interactions, with implementation in
Python for practical deployment.
  A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models
yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM)
interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving
preferences. This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and
identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer
optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our
prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and
Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world
CMAB applications.

Motivation: 风险厌恶强化学习在高风险领域有广泛应用，但现有方法因涉及指数计算而存在数值不稳定性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用指数效用函数框架推导Bellman方程，并引入基于Itakura-Saito散度的数值稳定损失函数来学习值函数。

Result: 实验表明，在多个金融场景（包括已知解析解的情况）中，新提出的损失函数性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Itakura-Saito散度的损失函数有效解决了风险厌恶强化学习中的数值不稳定问题，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes
fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize
expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk,
occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed
through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential
utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various
reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these
methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent
computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically
stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito
divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our
proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and
empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial
scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss
function outperforms the alternatives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Polar Express的GPU友好算法，用于计算极分解和矩阵符号函数，特别适用于深度学习中的Muon优化框架。该算法通过动态调整多项式更新规则，实现了快速收敛和稳定性，并在大规模模型如GPT-2上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的极分解算法（如Newton-Schulz）在深度学习中效率低下，因为它们需要高精度计算且不兼容GPU。深度学习场景下，高效且GPU兼容的方法更为重要，而高精度则非必需。

Method: Polar Express算法通过解决极小极大优化问题，动态调整多项式更新规则，仅使用矩阵-矩阵乘法，确保GPU兼容性。同时，算法解决了有限精度问题，使其在bfloat16下稳定运行。

Result: 实验表明，Polar Express在Muon优化框架中显著提升了验证损失性能，优于其他方法，并在GPT-2等大规模模型上表现一致。

Conclusion: Polar Express是一种高效、GPU兼容且稳定的极分解算法，特别适用于深度学习场景，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has
been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently,
it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within
the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting
differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep
learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high
accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like
Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based
on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are
poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a
GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical
polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix
multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &
Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule
at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that
it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both
rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address
finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply
Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent
improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,
outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Motivation: 当前多模态方法主要依赖自回归范式，本文旨在探索纯扩散模型在多模态任务中的潜力，提出LLaDA-V模型。

Method: 基于LLaDA语言扩散模型，引入视觉编码器和MLP连接器，将视觉特征投影到语言嵌入空间，实现多模态对齐。

Result: LLaDA-V在多模态理解任务中达到最先进性能，尽管在纯文本任务上表现较弱，但在多模态任务中与LLaMA3-V竞争激烈，并缩小了与Qwen2-VL的性能差距。

Conclusion: 大型语言扩散模型在多模态场景中展现出潜力，值得未来进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked
diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms
dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative
large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP
connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space,
enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals
several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal
performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks
than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same
instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal
tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to
Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal
tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal
understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely
diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion
models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in
future research. Project page and codes:

Abstract: This work develops the underpinnings of self-supervised placement-aware
representation learning given spatially-distributed (multi-view and multimodal)
sensor observations, motivated by the need to represent external environmental
state in multi-sensor IoT systems in a manner that correctly distills spatial
phenomena from the distributed multi-vantage observations. The objective of
sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally
observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory
observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must
therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the
observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the
observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of
the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work
significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals
beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of
IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements
and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core
design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We
further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information
theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into
the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world
datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and
earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and
robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements,
application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.

Conclusion: 该研究旨在推动结构化电子健康记录基础模型的实证评估，并为未来医疗基础模型的开发提供方向。

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their
capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks.
This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical
applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in
settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare.
However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical
utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and
sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional
supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically
meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and
chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate
state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients
from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic
medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We
measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface
tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data
representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation
of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future
healthcare foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）仍易受对抗攻击生成有害内容，传统对抗训练方法在LLMs中效果有限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出MixAT方法，结合更强的离散攻击和更快的连续攻击进行训练，并引入ALO-ASR指标评估模型最坏情况下的脆弱性。

Result: MixAT显著提升了模型鲁棒性（ALO-ASR < 20%），优于现有防御方法（ALO-ASR > 50%），且计算开销与连续松弛方法相当。

Conclusion: MixAT通过离散-连续防御提供了更优的鲁棒性-准确性权衡，有望构建更安全的LLMs。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment,
current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful
generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied
and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine
learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less
understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are
effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial
prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous
relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens,
such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of
discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT,
a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks
during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of
state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate
(ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show
MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to
prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to
methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic
deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank
adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation,
revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results
demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and
superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead,
highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and
models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting
sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning
(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of
Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation
emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of
predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that
decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form
task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate
that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level
representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving
Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the
form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic
intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward
encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers
substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both
vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as
heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be
seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;
whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they
often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their
capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This
establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using
information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling
alone cannot overcome.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting
model design and optimization for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems.
However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale,
synthetic datasets, raising concerns about the practical effectiveness of
ML-based solvers in real-world, large-scale CO scenarios. Additionally, many
existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility
for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we
introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO
problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph
neural networks and large language model (LLM) agents. FrontierCO features
challenging instances drawn from industrial applications and frontier CO
research, offering both realistic problem difficulty and abundant training
data. Our empirical results provide critical insights into the strengths and
limitations of current ML methods, helping to guide more robust and practically
relevant advances at the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial
optimization. Our data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习在人工智能应用中持续受到关注，但由于成本、硬件故障或模态感知信息性等因素，开发阶段收集的模态可能与部署时可用模态不同。忽略缺失性可能导致对模态价值的错误估计。

Method: 论文引入了ICYM2I框架，通过逆概率加权校正来评估缺失性下的预测性能和信息增益。

Conclusion: 忽略多模态学习中的缺失性会导致偏差，ICYM2I框架通过校正方法解决了这一问题，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based
applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining
different types of data. However, modalities collected and curated during
development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to
multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this
work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation
of the information gain associated with including an additional modality
without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that
modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of
missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from
ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You
Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance
and information gain under missingness through inverse probability
weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed
adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在高度过参数化的扩散模型中，自然数据领域的泛化能力在训练过程中逐步实现，早于记忆化现象的出现。通过实验验证，记忆化时间与数据集大小成正比，提出了一种基于数据集大小的早期停止准则来优化泛化并避免记忆化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型已成为现代生成AI的基石，但其泛化机制尚不明确。传统观点认为，若模型完美最小化训练损失，将仅生成训练集中的数据（即记忆化）。本文旨在重新审视这一观点，探讨泛化与记忆化的动态平衡。

Method: 通过从图像到语言扩散模型的系统性实验，验证记忆化时间与数据集大小的比例关系。此外，使用学习简单概率上下文无关文法的扩散模型，分析泛化与文法规则层次获取的关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，泛化与记忆化是时间尺度的竞争。在自然数据领域，泛化在记忆化之前实现。记忆化时间与数据集大小成正比，且早期停止的泛化成本可被量化。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于数据集大小的原则性早期停止准则，可有效优化泛化并避免记忆化，对超参数迁移和隐私敏感应用具有直接意义。研究结果通过相图总结，支持了泛化与记忆化的动态平衡理论。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative
AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly
understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training
loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e.,
memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this
view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models,
generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during
training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to
language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that
memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs.
memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We
show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple
probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization
corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training
time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized.
We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support
that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can
effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct
implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后训练方法SFT和RFT各有局限性：SFT可能导致过拟合并限制大模型的推理能力，而RFT依赖基础模型的强度且样本复杂度高。

Method: 提出统一微调(UFT)，将SFT和RFT整合为一个统一过程，使模型能有效探索解决方案并融入监督信号。

Result: UFT在不同规模模型上均优于SFT和RFT，并理论证明其突破了RFT的指数级样本复杂度瓶颈。

Conclusion: UFT通过统一训练范式显著提升了模型推理能力，为长序列推理任务提供了指数级加速收敛的可能。

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods
can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models,
but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger
models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends
heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT
and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm
that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the
model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative
supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking
underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in
general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that
UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for
the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence
on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the
most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity
of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have
emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics
simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a
differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with
Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both
the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established
benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show
that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated
turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised
training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular,
we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow
purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with
our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while
keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights
into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a
physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential
of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source:

apply it to examples from biological systems and ecological dynamics,
demonstrating accurate and interpretable results. Our approach significantly
enhances the potential of machine learning techniques in modeling complex

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse
problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or
noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model
and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an
unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator
architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse
observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous
mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling
approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in
function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five
PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy
improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while
reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning
ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of
discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and
inverse problems in the context of PDEs. Code is available at

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target
tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods
have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically
driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this
paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian
view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can
only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how
meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining
distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal
prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors,
yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not
possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and
Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and
different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are
sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very
effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating
activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an
important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

Conclusion: 本文强调了在扩散模型中进行概念擦除时全面评估的必要性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating
specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches
emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly
these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual
models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the
likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the
model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept
has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent
evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel
probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in
place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between
minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.
Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for
erasure in diffusion models.

Conclusion: RIPT-VLA是一种实用高效的后训练范式，通过最小监督实现跨任务和场景的泛化及鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based
interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards.
Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration
data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and
environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling
interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on
dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA
models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%,
and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it
is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration,
RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success
rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned
by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to
the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and
effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

Method: 使用LSTM+Geo与XGBoost过滤的种族/族裔估算模型（准确率89.2%），对比房产所有者与居民人口的种族构成。

Result: 白人房产所有权比例远超其人口占比，少数族裔社区在房产所有权中代表性不足，少数族裔聚居区尤为明显。

Conclusion: 房地产所有权中存在持续种族不平等，需数据驱动方法解决。

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York
State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an
advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering,
validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of
property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a
Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how
incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity
estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a
disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their
population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented
as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority
neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly
non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates
these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority
communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for
majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with
extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and
rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property
ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and
highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry,
BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

Motivation: 传统股价预测模型仅依赖单只股票的历史数据，忽略了股票间潜在的趋势相关性，限制了预测性能的提升空间。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，先训练单股模型，再迭代整合为全局模型，最后微调以保留局部特征，实现并行训练与计算资源高效利用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在预测性能上超越基准模型，并提升了现有先进方法的预测能力。

Conclusion: 跨股票趋势整合（CSTI）为股价预测提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，突破了传统单股学习方法的局限性。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting,
traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of
individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock
patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends,
which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning
methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of
price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel
method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through
cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning
(FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables
collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data,
facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy.
In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively
merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently
fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed
strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating
efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training
time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method,
demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive
capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy
of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction,
offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning
methodologies.

### [316] [The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716)
*Moritz Stargalla,Christoph Hertrich,Daniel Reichman*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了ReLU神经网络中线性区域的不同定义，分析了计算这些区域数量的计算复杂性，并证明了即使对于单隐藏层网络也是NP难和#P难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ReLU神经网络表达能力的度量标准——线性区域数量，但存在多种非等效的定义，需要系统评估这些定义及其相互关系。

Method: 系统梳理不同论文中线性区域的定义，分析这些定义之间的关系，并研究计算这些区域数量的计算复杂性。

Result: 证明即使对于单隐藏层网络，计算线性区域数量也是NP难和#P难问题；对于多隐藏层网络，近似计算也非常困难。同时，某些常见定义下可以在多项式空间内完成计数。

Conclusion: 线性区域数量的计算通常是一个难以处理的问题，但在某些定义下可以通过多项式空间算法实现。

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network
is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There
exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region
actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and
discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational
complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions.
Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and
#P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong
hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on
the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least
be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

Motivation: 现有信息检索基准主要关注通用或特定领域（如医学、金融），忽视了灾害管理场景中的语言复杂性和多样化信息需求，亟需专用基准以支持灾害决策。

Method: 构建DisastIR基准，涵盖48个检索任务（来自6种搜索意图和8类灾害），包含9600个多样化查询及130万标记查询-段落对，并评估30个前沿检索模型。

Result: 不同模型在灾害管理任务中表现差异显著，无单一模型全面领先；通用模型与灾害专用任务间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DisastIR填补了灾害管理领域检索基准的空白，证明需专用基准指导模型选择以提升灾害决策效果，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and
contextually relevant information. Existing Information Retrieval (IR)
benchmarks, however, focus primarily on general or specialized domains, such as
medicine or finance, neglecting the unique linguistic complexity and diverse
information needs encountered in disaster management scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we introduce DisastIR, the first comprehensive IR evaluation benchmark
specifically tailored for disaster management. DisastIR comprises 9,600 diverse
user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48
distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general
disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of
30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance
variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally.
Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between
general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the
necessity of disaster management-specific benchmarks for guiding IR model
selection to support effective decision-making in disaster management
scenarios. All source codes and DisastIR are available at

Motivation: 现有网页数据收集方法存在适应性差、成本高的问题，需要一种更高效、低成本的自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计AutoData多智能体系统，采用定向消息超图协调和超图缓存技术，支持自然语言指令驱动数据收集。

Result: 在Instruct2DS和三个现有基准测试中表现优于基线方法，案例研究验证了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: AutoData为自动化数据收集提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data-driven systems and AI technologies has
intensified the demand for high-quality web-sourced datasets. While existing
datasets have proven valuable, conventional web data collection approaches face
significant limitations in terms of human effort and scalability. Current
data-collecting solutions fall into two categories: wrapper-based methods that
struggle with adaptability and reproducibility, and large language model
(LLM)-based approaches that incur substantial computational and financial
costs. To address these challenges, we propose AutoData, a novel multi-agent
system for Automated web Data collection, that requires minimal human
intervention, i.e., only necessitating a natural language instruction
specifying the desired dataset. In addition, AutoData is designed with a robust
multi-agent architecture, featuring a novel oriented message hypergraph
coordinated by a central task manager, to efficiently organize agents across
research and development squads. Besides, we introduce a novel hypergraph cache
system to advance the multi-agent collaboration process that enables efficient
automated data collection and mitigates the token cost issues prevalent in
existing LLM-based systems. Moreover, we introduce Instruct2DS, a new benchmark
dataset supporting live data collection from web sources across three domains:
academic, finance, and sports. Comprehensive evaluations over Instruct2DS and
three existing benchmark datasets demonstrate AutoData's superior performance
compared to baseline methods. Case studies on challenging tasks such as picture
book collection and paper extraction from surveys further validate its
applicability. Our source code and dataset are available at

Method: 提出了一种系统化方法构建具有确定性、难度和多样性的挑战性查询，并开发了首个针对动态代理式信息检索的评估框架，包含细粒度指标。

Result: 通过广泛的实验，InfoDeepSeek揭示了代理行为的细微差别，并为未来研究提供了可操作的见解。

Conclusion: InfoDeepSeek为评估动态网络环境中的代理式信息检索提供了有效的工具，推动了相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,
Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents
into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short
in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval
environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to
elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess
information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making
them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web
environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with
challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in
real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for
constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,
difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation
framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including
fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of
information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search
engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and
offers actionable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索日志数据缺乏多样性和细节，限制了嵌入检索模型捕捉细微搜索模式的能力。

Method: 采用三种策略生成合成数据：生成查询、增强商品列表、从增强列表生成查询，并对比不同数据集训练效果。

Result: 合成数据使ROC_AUC提升4%，且纯合成数据训练模型表现优于原始数据或混合数据。

Conclusion: 生成式AI能有效创造高质量合成数据，显著提升嵌入检索模型性能。

Abstract: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search
engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results.
However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the
diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the
models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge,
we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data
generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask
approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the
capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating
high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.
We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points
from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three
strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)
generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different
datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing
Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic
data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings
underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and
listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low
levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in
ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the
same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data
often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original
and synthetic data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Conf-GNNRec的新方法，用于量化和校准基于图神经网络的推荐系统的预测置信度，以解决噪声和过自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中存在用户误用和恶意广告等噪声，这些噪声通过消息传播机制逐渐累积，导致预测结果不可信。现有研究虽通过降低噪声传播权重来缓解影响，但推荐系统的严重稀疏性仍使低权重噪声被误认为有意义信息。此外，现有基于GNN的推荐存在过自信问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于用户个性化的评分校准方法，动态调整过高评分以减轻过自信；设计了一种置信度损失函数，减少负样本的过自信，从而提升推荐性能。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验证明，Conf-GNNRec在预测置信度和推荐性能方面均有效。

Conclusion: Conf-GNNRec能够有效量化和校准基于GNN的推荐系统的预测置信度，解决噪声和过自信问题，提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such
as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise
such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through
the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their
effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the
recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being
mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on
the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to
measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy
framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based
recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above
considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the
prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically,
we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive
ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also
design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative
samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on
public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction
confidence and recommendation performance.

Motivation: 当前文档检索增强生成方法过于依赖文本，忽视视觉信息，且缺乏评估多模态证据选择与整合的基准。

Method: 构建包含4055个专家标注QA对的MMDocRAG基准，引入多模态引用选择指标，并测试60个VLM/LLM模型及14个检索系统。

Result: 专有LVMs表现优于开源模型，多模态输入带来中等优势，微调LLMs通过详细图像描述显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MMDocRAG为开发更鲁棒的多模态DocVQA系统提供了严格测试环境和实用见解。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in
processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing
cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG)
methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing
critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for
assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG,
a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with
multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative
metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that
interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments
with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent
challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key
findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than
open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal
inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant
performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial
improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a
rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more
robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at

Motivation: 尽管双语者频繁使用混合语言进行网络搜索，但信息检索（IR）领域对此研究较少，因此需要建立相关基准和探索有效方法。

Method: 引入MiLQ测试集，评估多语言IR模型在原生、英语和混合语言查询上的表现，并分析代码切换训练数据的潜力。

Result: 多语言IR模型在混合查询上表现中等且不一致，英语混合查询因增强的词汇匹配而更有效。

Conclusion: 混合语言查询是双语者搜索的重要策略，代码切换数据有助于提升IR模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite bilingual speakers frequently using mixed-language queries in web
searches, Information Retrieval (IR) research on them remains scarce. To
address this, we introduce MiLQ,Mixed-Language Query test set, the first public
benchmark of mixed-language queries, confirmed as realistic and highly
preferred. Experiments show that multilingual IR models perform moderately on
MiLQ and inconsistently across native, English, and mixed-language queries,
also suggesting code-switched training data's potential for robust IR models
handling such queries. Meanwhile, intentional English mixing in queries proves
an effective strategy for bilinguals searching English documents, which our
analysis attributes to enhanced token matching compared to native queries.

Motivation: 随着推理模型在复杂自然语言任务中的成功，研究者探索如何将推理能力整合到基于大语言模型（LLM）的段落重排序器中，以提升性能。

Method: 通过比较推理型重排序器（ReasonRR）与非推理型（StandardRR）在相同训练条件下的表现，并进一步禁用ReasonRR的推理功能（ReasonRR-NoReason）进行对比分析。

Result: StandardRR普遍优于ReasonRR，而ReasonRR-NoReason表现优于ReasonRR，表明推理过程导致模型倾向于极化相关性评分，忽略了部分相关性。

Conclusion: 推理过程限制了重排序器的性能，因其无法有效处理段落的部分相关性，而非推理模型在此任务中更具优势。

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language
tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun
exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage
rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ
an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving
at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking
accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact
of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers
(ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under
identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally
outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the
importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process
(ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more
effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings
reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning
process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to
consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of
pointwise rerankers.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究发现某些训练数据集会影响检索模型效果，提出用级联LLM提示识别并重新标注假阴性样本，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模检索数据集（如BGE）中部分数据会降低模型效果，尤其是假阴性样本（相关段落被错误标注为不相关）问题突出，需优化数据质量。

Method: 采用级联LLM提示（如GPT-4o）低成本识别假阴性样本，并将其重新标注为真阳性。

Result: 重标注使E5和Qwen2.5-7B模型在BEIR上nDCG@10提升0.7-1.4，在AIR-Bench零样本评估上提升1.7-1.8；微调后的Qwen2.5-3B重排序器也表现类似提升。

Conclusion: 通过LLM重标注假阴性样本能有效提升检索模型性能，且GPT-4o的标注结果与人工标注一致性更高。

Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale
retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million
query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that
certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of
15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by
2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a
deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false
negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We
propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to
identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling
false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B
retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot
AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on
the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the
cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we
find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than
GPT-4o-mini.

Motivation: 当前研究通常将大型语言模型（LLM）作为外部推理模块来增强推荐系统，但这种解耦设计存在资源成本高和联合优化不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种统一的大型推荐模型，通过重新设计架构实现推理和推荐的交替进行，并提出了RecPO强化学习框架，同时优化推理和推荐能力。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该模型在Hit@5和NDCG@20指标上分别相对提升了68.67%和45.21%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过统一模型和强化学习框架，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，且无需依赖专门的推理标注。

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via
encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning
synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. Current
studies usually position LLMs as external reasoning modules to yield auxiliary
thought for augmenting conventional recommendation pipelines. However, such
decoupled designs are limited in significant resource cost and suboptimal joint
optimization. To address these issues, we propose \name, a unified large
recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Initially, we
reconceptualize the model architecture to facilitate interleaved reasoning and
recommendation in the autoregressive process. Subsequently, we propose RecPO, a
corresponding reinforcement learning framework that optimizes \name\ both the
reasoning and recommendation capabilities simultaneously in a single policy
update; RecPO introduces a fused reward scheme that solely leverages
recommendation labels to simulate the reasoning capability, eliminating
dependency on specialized reasoning annotations. Experiments on three datasets
with various baselines verify the effectiveness of \name, showing relative
improvements of 68.67\% in Hit@5 and 45.21\% in NDCG@20. Code available at

Motivation: 解决Meta的HSTU方法中因异构信息映射到相同向量空间导致的训练不稳定问题，并减少对人工特征工程的依赖。

Method: 采用双流架构（DFGR），在自注意力机制的QKV模块中集成真实流与虚假流的创新交互模式。

Result: 在开源和工业数据集上表现优于DIN、DCN等基线模型，并探索了计算约束下的最优参数分配策略。

Conclusion: DFGR是一种高效且有效的下一代生成排序范式，适用于推荐系统。

Abstract: We introduce the Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR), a two-stream
architecture designed for recommendation systems. DFGR integrates innovative
interaction patterns between real and fake flows within the QKV modules of the
self-attention mechanism, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.
This approach effectively addresses a key limitation observed in Meta's
proposed HSTU generative recommendation approach, where heterogeneous
information volumes are mapped into identical vector spaces, leading to
training instability. Unlike traditional recommendation models, DFGR only
relies on user history behavior sequences and minimal attribute information,
eliminating the need for extensive manual feature engineering. Comprehensive
evaluations on open-source and industrial datasets reveal DFGR's superior
performance compared to established baselines such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and
DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under
computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective
next-generation generate ranking paradigm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为通用数据格式（CDF）的标准化足球数据格式，旨在解决不同数据提供商在数据收集、规范和表示上的差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足球比赛中，各方收集的数据存在差异，包括数据类型、规范、表示方式和交付方式，导致数据分析和利用成本高昂。

Method: 提出CDF格式，规定了五种比赛数据的最小模式：比赛名单数据、视频片段、事件数据、追踪数据和比赛元数据，确保数据清晰、上下文完整。

Result: CDF格式明确了技术规范、数据表示选择和数据交付方法，支持常见下游分析任务。

Conclusion: CDF为足球数据提供了一种统一且标准化的格式，降低了数据使用门槛，提升了分析效率。

Abstract: During football matches, a variety of different parties (e.g., companies)
each collect (possibly overlapping) data about the match ranging from basic
information (e.g., starting players) to detailed positional data. This data is
provided to clubs, federations, and other organizations who are increasingly
interested in leveraging this data to inform their decision making.
Unfortunately, analyzing such data pose significant barriers because each
provider may (1) collect different data, (2) use different specifications even
within the same category of data, (3) represent the data differently, and (4)
delivers the data in a different manner (e.g., file format, protocol).
Consequently, working with these data requires a significant investment of time
and money. The goal of this work is to propose a uniform and standardized
format for football data called the Common Data Format (CDF). The CDF specifies
a minimal schema for five types of match data: match sheet data, video footage,
event data, tracking data, and match meta data. It aims to ensure that the
provided data is clear, sufficiently contextualized (e.g., its provenance is
clear), and complete such that it enables common downstream analysis tasks.
Concretely, this paper will detail the technical specifications of the CDF, the
representational choices that were made to help ensure the clarity of the
provided data, and a concrete approach for delivering data in the CDF.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which build on Large Language Models (LLMs) and interact
with tools and memory, have rapidly advanced in capability and scope. Yet,
since LLMs have been shown to struggle in multilingual settings, typically
resulting in lower performance and reduced safety, agentic systems risk
inheriting these limitations. This raises concerns about the global
accessibility of such systems, as users interacting in languages other than
English may encounter unreliable or security-critical agent behavior. Despite
growing interest in evaluating agentic AI, existing benchmarks focus
exclusively on English, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. To address
this gap, we propose MAPS, a multilingual benchmark suite designed to evaluate
agentic AI systems across diverse languages and tasks. MAPS builds on four
widely used agentic benchmarks - GAIA (real-world tasks), SWE-bench (code
generation), MATH (mathematical reasoning), and the Agent Security Benchmark
(security). We translate each dataset into ten diverse languages, resulting in
805 unique tasks and 8,855 total language-specific instances. Our benchmark
suite enables a systematic analysis of how multilingual contexts affect agent
performance and robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent degradation in
both performance and security when transitioning from English to other
languages, with severity varying by task and correlating with the amount of
translated input. Building on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations to guide agentic AI systems development and assessment under
multilingual settings. This work establishes a standardized evaluation
framework, encouraging future research towards equitable, reliable, and
globally accessible agentic AI. MAPS benchmark suite is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出WikiDBGraph，一个包含10万个真实表格数据库的大规模图结构，通过1700万条边连接，用于提升协作学习在表格数据中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格数据的深度学习研究受限于单表或孤立数据库，缺乏真实世界互连表格资源，限制了模型能力。

Method: 构建WikiDBGraph，包含10万个WikiData表格数据库，通过模式和分布特征定义节点和边属性，加权边识别重叠数据库。

Result: 实验证明协作学习在新识别的互连数据库上表现更优，为结构化基础模型训练提供潜力。

Conclusion: WikiDBGraph解决了互连表格数据稀缺问题，同时揭示了未来研究方向与挑战。

Abstract: Tabular data, ubiquitous and rich in informational value, is an increasing
focus for deep representation learning, yet progress is hindered by studies
centered on single tables or isolated databases, which limits model
capabilities due to data scale. While collaborative learning approaches such as
federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation
models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by
a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes
and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined
inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a
large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData,
interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge
properties derived from its database schema and data distribution.
WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped
databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that
collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering
considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also
exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected
tabular data.

*Yuliang Yan,Haochun Tang,Shuo Yan,Enyan Dai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DuFFin的双层指纹框架，用于在黑盒设置下验证大型语言模型（LLM）的所有权，有效保护模型知识产权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练大型语言模型的计算成本巨大，保护其知识产权（IP）免受恶意窃取或未经授权的部署变得至关重要。现有的水印和指纹方法要么影响文本生成过程，要么仅限于白盒访问，实用性有限。

Method: DuFFin通过提取触发模式和知识级指纹来识别可疑模型的来源，支持黑盒设置下的所有权验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确验证基础保护LLM及其变体（如微调、量化和安全对齐版本）的版权，IP-ROC指标超过0.95。

Conclusion: DuFFin是一种实用且高效的黑盒指纹框架，能够有效保护LLM的知识产权。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered valuable Intellectual Properties
(IP) for legitimate owners due to the enormous computational cost of training.
It is crucial to protect the IP of LLMs from malicious stealing or unauthorized
deployment. Despite existing efforts in watermarking and fingerprinting LLMs,
these methods either impact the text generation process or are limited in
white-box access to the suspect model, making them impractical. Hence, we
propose DuFFin, a novel $\textbf{Du}$al-Level $\textbf{Fin}$gerprinting
$\textbf{F}$ramework for black-box setting ownership verification. DuFFin
extracts the trigger pattern and the knowledge-level fingerprints to identify
the source of a suspect model. We conduct experiments on a variety of models
collected from the open-source website, including four popular base models as
protected LLMs and their fine-tuning, quantization, and safety alignment
versions, which are released by large companies, start-ups, and individual
users. Results show that our method can accurately verify the copyright of the
base protected LLM on their model variants, achieving the IP-ROC metric greater
than 0.95. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CTRAP的新方法，通过诱导模型崩溃来防止大型语言模型被恶意微调攻击利用，而非选择性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的选择性遗忘防御方法存在缺陷，大型语言模型因其强大的通用适应能力，能轻易绕过选择性遗忘，重新学习或转向有害任务。

Method: 提出CTRAP机制，在模型对齐阶段预配置其对后续微调的响应。若检测到恶意微调行为，CTRAP会触发模型核心语言建模能力的渐进退化，使其对攻击者失效。

Result: 实验表明，CTRAP能有效抵御多种大型语言模型和攻击场景下的有害微调风险，同时在良性场景下保持高性能。

Conclusion: CTRAP通过模型崩溃机制解决了选择性遗忘无法应对的核心问题，为防御恶意微调攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-service, while commercially successful for Large Language
Model (LLM) providers, exposes models to harmful fine-tuning attacks. As a
widely explored defense paradigm against such attacks, unlearning attempts to
remove malicious knowledge from LLMs, thereby essentially preventing them from
being used to perform malicious tasks. However, we highlight a critical flaw:
the powerful general adaptability of LLMs allows them to easily bypass
selective unlearning by rapidly relearning or repurposing their capabilities
for harmful tasks. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a
paradigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model
collapse--effectively forcing the model to "unlearn everything"--specifically
in response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse
directly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,
tackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the
Collapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept
conditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's
reaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning
constitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured
trap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling
abilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.
Crucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,
ensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for
legitimate users. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that CTRAP
effectively counters harmful fine-tuning risks across various LLMs and attack
settings, while maintaining high performance in benign scenarios. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CTRAP.

*Md Ashraf Uddin,Nam H. Chu,Reza Rafeh,Mutaz Barika*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对车联网(IoV)的分层分类框架，通过边缘节点独立检测特定攻击，并利用云端进行全面分析，解决了现有集中式入侵检测系统响应延迟高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网因其动态性、移动性和无线数据传输特性，易受多种网络威胁。现有集中式机器学习入侵检测系统依赖云端，导致响应延迟高，而边缘节点资源有限，难以部署复杂算法。

Method: 采用分层分类框架，使分类器能在不同层级训练和测试；使用Boruta特征选择方法降低数据维度，优化边缘节点处理效率。

Result: 在CIC-IoV2024数据集上测试，证明了该框架在保护车联网安全方面的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 分层分类框架能有效平衡边缘节点资源限制与实时威胁检测需求，为车联网安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Due to its nature of dynamic, mobility, and wireless data transfer, the
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is prone to various cyber threats, ranging from
spoofing and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks to malware. To
safeguard the IoV ecosystem from intrusions, malicious activities, policy
violations, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role by
continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate
potential threats in real-time. However, most existing research has focused on
developing centralized, machine learning-based IDS systems for IoV without
accounting for its inherently distributed nature. Due to intensive computing
requirements, these centralized systems often rely on the cloud to detect cyber
threats, increasing delay of system response. On the other hand, edge nodes
typically lack the necessary resources to train and deploy complex machine
learning algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective
hierarchical classification framework tailored for IoV networks. Hierarchical
classification allows classifiers to be trained and tested at different levels,
enabling edge nodes to detect specific types of attacks independently. With
this approach, edge nodes can conduct targeted attack detection while
leveraging cloud nodes for comprehensive threat analysis and support. Given the
resource constraints of edge nodes, we have employed the Boruta feature
selection method to reduce data dimensionality, optimizing processing
efficiency. To evaluate our proposed framework, we utilize the latest IoV
security dataset CIC-IoV2024, achieving promising results that demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our models in securing IoV networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型安全威胁：通过操纵大语言模型(LLM)的系统提示，使其仅对特定目标问题生成恶意回答，同时保持对其他问题的正常响应。研究者开发了CAIN算法来自动生成此类有害提示，并在实验中验证了其攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然应用广泛，但易受对抗攻击。本研究旨在揭示一种隐蔽的新型威胁——通过篡改系统提示实现定向信息操控，这种攻击可能被恶意行为者大规模利用。

Method: 开发了CAIN算法，能够在黑盒环境下（无需访问模型参数）自动为特定目标问题生成有害系统提示。

Result: 在开源和商业LLM上的测试显示：非定向攻击可使目标问题F1值下降40%而不影响正常回答；定向攻击能在保持正常问题准确率的同时，使目标有害回答F1值超过70%。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了增强LLM鲁棒性的紧迫性，需要采取新的安全措施来保障实际应用中的模型完整性和安全性。所有源代码将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also
known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a
novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs'
system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions
(e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"),
while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable
malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading
harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an
attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such
harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or
without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source
and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In
untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves
up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy
on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific
harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses
with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical
need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of
LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: BadVLA首次揭示了视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的后门漏洞，通过目标解耦优化实现高效攻击，几乎不影响正常任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人控制中表现出色，但其紧密耦合架构存在潜在安全风险，尤其是后门攻击这一隐蔽且持久的威胁尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出BadVLA方法：1) 特征空间分离隔离触发器表征；2) 条件控制偏差机制确保仅触发时激活攻击，保持正常任务性能。

Result: 在多个VLA基准测试中实现近100%攻击成功率，对正常任务准确率影响极小，且能抵抗输入扰动、任务迁移和模型微调。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统揭示了VLA模型的后门漏洞，强调了安全可信的具身模型设计实践的紧迫性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic control by enabling
end-to-end decision-making directly from multimodal inputs. However, their
tightly coupled architectures expose novel security vulnerabilities. Unlike
traditional adversarial perturbations, backdoor attacks represent a stealthier,
persistent, and practically significant threat-particularly under the emerging
Training-as-a-Service paradigm-but remain largely unexplored in the context of
VLA models. To address this gap, we propose BadVLA, a backdoor attack method
based on Objective-Decoupled Optimization, which for the first time exposes the
backdoor vulnerabilities of VLA models. Specifically, it consists of a
two-stage process: (1) explicit feature-space separation to isolate trigger
representations from benign inputs, and (2) conditional control deviations that
activate only in the presence of the trigger, while preserving clean-task
performance. Empirical results on multiple VLA benchmarks demonstrate that
BadVLA consistently achieves near-100% attack success rates with minimal impact
on clean task accuracy. Further analyses confirm its robustness against common
input perturbations, task transfers, and model fine-tuning, underscoring
critical security vulnerabilities in current VLA deployments. Our work offers
the first systematic investigation of backdoor vulnerabilities in VLA models,
highlighting an urgent need for secure and trustworthy embodied model design
practices. We have released the project page at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的推理成本攻击方法'BitHydra'，通过翻转模型参数的关键位来迫使LLMs生成最长输出，仅需少量样本和位翻转即可实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理成本攻击方法效果有限，因为它们属于自目标攻击，攻击者需通过输入执行攻击且成本自负。本文旨在开发一种直接针对模型本身的攻击方式。

Method: 设计'BitHydra'方法：通过抑制<EOS>标记概率的损失函数指导，结合高效关键位搜索算法，翻转模型参数的关键位。

Result: 在11个1.5B-14B参数的LLMs上验证，仅需4个搜索样本和3次位翻转即可使100%测试提示达到最大生成长度（如2048个token）。

Conclusion: BitHydra展现出高效性、可扩展性和强迁移性，揭示了LLMs参数空间中对推理成本攻击的脆弱性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide
range of applications, but their ever-increasing size and resource demands make
them vulnerable to inference cost attacks, where attackers induce victim LLMs
to generate the longest possible output content. In this paper, we revisit
existing inference cost attacks and reveal that these methods can hardly
produce large-scale malicious effects since they are self-targeting, where
attackers are also the users and therefore have to execute attacks solely
through the inputs, whose generated content will be charged by LLMs and can
only directly influence themselves. Motivated by these findings, this paper
introduces a new type of inference cost attacks (dubbed 'bit-flip inference
cost attack') that target the victim model itself rather than its inputs.
Specifically, we design a simple yet effective method (dubbed 'BitHydra') to
effectively flip critical bits of model parameters. This process is guided by a
loss function designed to suppress <EOS> token's probability with an efficient
critical bit search algorithm, thus explicitly defining the attack objective
and enabling effective optimization. We evaluate our method on 11 LLMs ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters under both int8 and float16 settings. Experimental
results demonstrate that with just 4 search samples and as few as 3 bit flips,
BitHydra can force 100% of test prompts to reach the maximum generation length
(e.g., 2048 tokens) on representative LLMs such as LLaMA3, highlighting its
efficiency, scalability, and strong transferability across unseen inputs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对开源语言模型的领域特定水印技术，用于解决模型溯源问题，该方法在保证检测可靠性的同时提升了水印的持久性和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源语言模型能力的增强和广泛使用，确保模型溯源（即识别模型实例的来源）变得日益重要。现有的基于后门的模型指纹技术往往无法满足实际所有权检测的关键需求。

Method: 论文引入了领域特定水印的概念，通过训练模型仅在特定子领域（如特定语言或主题）中嵌入水印，从而在保证检测可靠性的同时提升水印的持久性和生成质量。

Result: 评估表明，领域特定水印能够实现具有强统计保证、可控误报率、高检测能力和保持生成质量的模型指纹。此外，指纹具有天然的隐蔽性，并能自然适应不同部署场景的变异性。

Conclusion: 领域特定水印技术为开源语言模型的溯源提供了一种可靠且高效的解决方案，适用于多种实际部署场景。

Abstract: As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared
and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a
given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue. At the same
time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short
of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection. In this
work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model
watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be
effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance. To this end,
we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model
fingerprinting. Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the
model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular
languages or topics). This targeted approach ensures detection reliability,
while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world
deployment settings. Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking
enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable
false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality.
Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally
robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击难以同时实现毒性隐蔽和语言自然性，因此需要一种更隐蔽的攻击方法来识别漏洞并提升模型安全性。

Method: 使用隐写术将有害查询隐藏在语义连贯的良性文本中，并引导LLM提取隐藏查询并以加密方式响应。

Result: 在四种主流LLM上测试，StegoAttack平均攻击成功率达92%，且在外部检测下性能下降不足1%。

Conclusion: StegoAttack在隐蔽性和攻击效果上均优于现有方法，为LLM安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by
bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying
these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model
security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the
novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to
simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic
stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose
StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide
the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then
prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner.
This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness,
allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate
StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking
against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack
success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%.
Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama
Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth
detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth
capabilities. The code is available at

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）虽然性能优越，但容易被滥用。现有的指纹识别方法在隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面存在不足，因此需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: CoTSRF通过设计特定的CoT查询收集源LLM的响应，使用对比学习训练一个CoT提取器来提取指纹特征，并通过Kullback-Leibler散度进行指纹验证。

Result: 实验表明，CoTSRF在隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，能够有效识别LLM的来源。

Conclusion: CoTSRF为LLM指纹识别提供了一种隐蔽且鲁棒的新方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite providing superior performance, open-source large language models
(LLMs) are vulnerable to abusive usage. To address this issue, recent works
propose LLM fingerprinting methods to identify the specific source LLMs behind
suspect applications. However, these methods fail to provide stealthy and
robust fingerprint verification. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM
fingerprinting scheme, namely CoTSRF, which utilizes the Chain of Thought (CoT)
as the fingerprint of an LLM. CoTSRF first collects the responses from the
source LLM by querying it with crafted CoT queries. Then, it applies
contrastive learning to train a CoT extractor that extracts the CoT feature
(i.e., fingerprint) from the responses. Finally, CoTSRF conducts fingerprint
verification by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the CoT
features of the source and suspect LLMs against an empirical threshold. Various
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed
CoTSRF for fingerprinting LLMs, particularly in stealthy and robust fingerprint
verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly equipped with capabilities of
real-time web search and integrated with protocols like Model Context Protocol
(MCP). This extension could introduce new security vulnerabilities. We present
a systematic investigation of LLM vulnerabilities to hidden adversarial prompts
through malicious font injection in external resources like webpages, where
attackers manipulate code-to-glyph mapping to inject deceptive content which
are invisible to users. We evaluate two critical attack scenarios: (1)
"malicious content relay" and (2) "sensitive data leakage" through MCP-enabled
tools. Our experiments reveal that indirect prompts with injected malicious
font can bypass LLM safety mechanisms through external resources, achieving
varying success rates based on data sensitivity and prompt design. Our research
underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures in LLM deployments
when processing external content.

Abstract: Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in
energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The
ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is
critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent
years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with
rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for
accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a
powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that
satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related
work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this
area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent
progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of
materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We
then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials
generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics
and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude
with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The

### [343] [From Hand-Crafted Metrics to Evolved Training-Free Performance Predictors for Neural Architecture Search via Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15832)
*Quan Minh Phan,Ngoc Hoang Luong*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于遗传编程的符号回归框架，用于自动化设计零成本（ZC）指标，以提升神经架构搜索（NAS）的效率与普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零成本指标存在不一致性问题，且设计过程依赖人工试错与领域知识，亟需自动化方法来提升其通用性与设计效率。

Method: 采用遗传编程驱动的符号回归框架，自动合成具有高排名相关性的ZC指标，并兼容现有手工指标进行优化。

Result: 在13个NAS基准测试中，自动生成的ZC指标全面优于手工设计指标，且仅需单块消费级GPU在15分钟内找到高性能网络架构。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了ZC指标的自动化设计，显著提升了NAS的搜索效率与跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven
both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by
the substantial variation in their performance across different problems.
Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain
expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate
the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC
metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a
framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the
design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also
capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank
correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and
tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero
demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform
hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search
objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures
with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex,
decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and
privacy-preserving decision-making systems has become critical. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with
evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent
systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN)
leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and
entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while
integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in
dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures
privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without
sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in
real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for
applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare.
This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing,
evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex
problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI
in real-world, privacy-sensitive applications.

### [345] [TDFormer: A Top-Down Attention-Controlled Spiking Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15840)
*Zizheng Zhu,Yingchao Yu,Zeqi Zheng,Zhaofei Yu,Yaochu Jin*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出TDFormer模型，通过引入自上而下的反馈结构增强传统脉冲神经网络的时间信息处理能力，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲神经网络（SNNs）中，膜电位的隐式特性限制了其有效表示时间信息的能力，导致每个时间步无法充分利用先前时间步的信息，从而严重限制了模型性能。

Method: 受大脑自上而下机制的启发，提出TDFormer模型，采用分层结构的自上而下反馈机制，利用早期时间步的高阶表示来调制后期低阶信息的处理。

Result: TDFormer在多个数据集上显著提升性能，尤其在ImageNet上达到86.83%的准确率，实现最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDFormer通过反馈结构增强了时间步间的信息传递和梯度传播，有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of
multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters
are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link
between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its
ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time
step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously
limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the
brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure
that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from
earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later
stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During
forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time
steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and
integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we
theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of
vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms
together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on
multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将预训练的人工神经网络(ANN)转换为稀疏且对抗鲁棒的脉冲神经网络(SNN)的算法，显著提升了内存和能效，同时保持高性能和对抗威胁的鲁棒性。


<details>

Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems
requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory
efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against
malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness
of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial
robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a
neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and
adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse
connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network
(ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a
novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with
enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and
activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number
of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy
efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and
robustness against adversarial threats.

*Saining Liu,Yi Mei,Mengjie Zhang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出CL-GPGLS方法，通过课程学习改进GPGLS，逐步引入训练实例以优化大规模车辆路径问题求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如GPGLS依赖随机选择训练实例，缺乏系统性。为提升大规模VRP求解效果，需设计更科学的训练策略。

Method: 将课程学习（CL）融入GPGLS框架，按预设课程由易到难渐进式引入训练实例。

Result: 实验表明CL-GPGLS显著优于三种基线方法，验证了渐进式训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 课程学习的引入使模型能更好适应大规模VRP，为数据驱动的启发式方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is
a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently,
data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically
learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to
unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform
well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen
test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to
learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale
VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances
during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing
studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this,
we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL)
into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce
training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually
increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for
large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of
CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three
baseline methods.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用神经形态计算（NC）范式建模和实现优化算法，特别是元启发式算法，以替代传统的冯·诺依曼架构，从而在解决优化问题上取得突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经形态计算（NC）作为一种新的算法范式，与传统的冯·诺依曼架构有显著不同。NC通过模拟大脑的神经动力学，以脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的形式实现。目前，NC的研究主要集中在机器学习和神经科学模拟领域。本文旨在探索NC在优化算法和元启发式算法中的应用潜力，以解决传统计算架构在优化问题上的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文总结了NC在优化算法中的应用潜力，并讨论了未来需要解决的关键问题，以推动Nheuristics的进一步发展和应用。

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm
representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann
architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the
form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has
concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations.
This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization
algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an
alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving
optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be
characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems
are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several
challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A
guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the
different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We
also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the
development and application of Nheuristics.

Motivation: 深度强化学习在动态算法配置中应用广泛，但在多目标组合优化问题中的算法配置研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将动态算法配置建模为马尔可夫决策过程，利用图神经网络学习目标空间中解的收敛图嵌入，以增强状态表示。

Conclusion: 该方法在多目标组合优化问题中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性和泛化能力，适用于不同的进化计算方法。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm
configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from
the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However,
applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial
optimization (MOCO) problems remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents
a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms. We model the dynamic algorithm configuration as a
Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the
objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance
the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that
our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration
methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous
generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to
different evolutionary computation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 染色体分析对遗传疾病诊断和癌症治疗至关重要，但现有AI模型因染色体异常的复杂性和多样性、标注数据需求大以及任务特异性强而受限。

Method: CHROMA通过自监督学习在84,000多个样本（约400万张染色体图像）上进行预训练，学习染色体异常的通用表示。

Result: CHROMA在所有类型的染色体异常识别中表现优于其他方法，即使在标注数据较少或数据集不平衡的情况下也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: CHROMA为临床分析提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，通过早期检测罕见基因组异常推动精准肿瘤学发展，并降低高级基因组分析的门槛。

Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding
cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal
aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming
complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive
annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack
generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse
resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for
cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable
representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000
specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA
outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained
on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating
comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various
aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for
experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare
genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making
advanced genomic analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability
worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95%
accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the
present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable
machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely
gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public
cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous
data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and
class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
(SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and
random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied
algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a
multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold
cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the
proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a
support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner.
The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of
97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual
model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate
that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert
low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of
the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical
reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic
dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC
framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node
activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear
nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the
underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with
varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for
dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an
autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of
varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in
maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the
learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.

Result: 开发出AutoMCQ系统，实现代码理解问题的规模化自动生成。

Conclusion: AutoMCQ能高效评估代码理解水平，同时辅助检测抄袭，为编程教育提供可行工具。

Abstract: Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This
sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can
mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In
addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a
world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code
comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to
gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect
plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult
and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for
the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This
is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种软件工程任务中表现出色，但在面向大型现有代码库开发新功能的任务（FDD）上仍缺乏研究。

Method: 引入SWE-Dev数据集，包含14,000个训练样本和500个测试样本，提供可运行环境和开发者编写的单元测试，支持监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 实验显示当前AI在FDD任务上表现不佳（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet在困难测试集上仅22.45%通过率），但微调后7B模型可媲美GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev是提升模型在功能开发任务上性能的有效平台，其高质量数据对模型改进具有重要价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capability in diverse software
engineering tasks, e.g. code completion, bug fixing, and document generation.
However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task
that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases,
remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale
dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and
train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To
ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances
with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests.
This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate
reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on
SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current
AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test
split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform
for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model
comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its
high-quality training data. Code is available here

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks
remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM
agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising
concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates
whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without
requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling
LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic
information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph
Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's
attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a
specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our
approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark
using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among
open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth
overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying automatically procedural programs
manipulating parametric-size arrays of integers, encoded as a constrained Horn
clauses solving problem. We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing
loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally
quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program
variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree
Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique
based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays
to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained
classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and
procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its
efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant
benchmark.

### [358] [CoT Information: Improved Sample Complexity under Chain-of-Thought Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15927)
*Awni Altabaa,Omar Montasser,John Lafferty*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个关于链式思考（CoT）监督学习的统计理论，通过引入CoT信息度量，证明了CoT监督能显著提升学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习在处理需要多步推理的复杂函数时面临挑战。CoT监督通过提供中间推理步骤，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力。本文旨在从统计理论角度分析CoT监督的学习机制。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的统计框架，通过定义CoT信息度量（ℐ𝒟,ℎ⋆CoT(𝜖;ℋ)），量化观察推理过程带来的额外判别能力，并链接训练目标（CoT风险）和测试目标（端到端风险）。

Result: 理论结果表明，CoT监督能显著降低样本复杂度，目标误差𝜖所需的样本复杂度为𝑑/ℐ𝒟,ℎ⋆CoT(𝜖;ℋ)，远优于传统的𝑑/𝜖速率。同时，论文还给出了CoT信息的信息论下界。

Conclusion: CoT信息是链式思考监督学习中的基本统计复杂度度量，CoT监督能显著提升学习效率，为复杂推理任务提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a
significant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output
examples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate
reasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful
empirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory
of learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in
contrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training
objective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part
of our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two
types of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via
the *CoT information measure* $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, which quantifies the additional
discriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main
theoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly
faster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is
shown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error
$\epsilon$ scales as $d/\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis
class complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\epsilon$ rates.
Information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also
obtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental
measure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought
supervision.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: PO-Flow是一种新型连续归一化流框架，用于因果推断，联合建模潜在结果和反事实，无需显式分布假设，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推断方法通常需要显式分布假设（如高斯混合），限制了其灵活性和应用范围。PO-Flow旨在提供一个无需此类假设的统一框架，支持潜在结果预测、反事实预测和不确定性感知密度学习。

Method: PO-Flow基于连续归一化流（CNF）框架，通过流匹配训练，联合建模潜在结果和反事实，支持高维数据（如图像生成）。

Result: 在ACIC、IHDP和IBM等基准测试中，PO-Flow在多种因果推断任务上表现优于现有方法，并能处理高维数据（如反事实图像生成）。

Conclusion: PO-Flow为因果推断提供了一个灵活且强大的框架，无需显式分布假设，适用于广泛场景，包括高维数据。

Abstract: We propose PO-Flow, a novel continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for
causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals.
Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for
individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and
uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to
enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit
distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting
counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general
observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it
consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference
tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including
counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*Renato Berlinghieri,Yunyi Shen,Jialong Jiang,Tamara Broderick*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SnapMMD的新框架，通过最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，以学习潜在随机动力学，解决了现有方法在预测方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学家们经常需要基于“快照”数据进行超出观测时间范围的预测，例如在单细胞mRNA时间序列分析中，由于测量会破坏细胞，无法追踪单个细胞的轨迹。现有方法在预测方面存在局限性，如依赖预设的动态参考或固定的状态无关波动性。

Method: 提出SnapMMD框架，利用最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，从而推断未知且状态依赖的波动性。

Result: 在多种真实和合成实验中，SnapMMD方法能够提供准确的预测，且在插值和速度场重建方面的性能优于或至少等同于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SnapMMD框架不仅能够准确预测，还能处理不完整的状态测量，并提供诊断拟合的统计量，展现出在潜在随机动力学学习中的优越性能。

Abstract: Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of
"snapshot" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time
course single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular
transcriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological
replicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of
any one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to
forecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem
cells. Recent Schr\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating
between snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely
since existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference
dynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed,
state-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Either case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we
propose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the
joint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to
infer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show
in a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers
accurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence
of incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that
diagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and
general velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better
than) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.

Motivation: 探讨不同数据-目标复杂度下随机动量算法的损失曲线形状及缩放规律，以优化计算效率。

Method: 使用随机动量算法（SGD-M和DANA）在幂律随机特征模型上进行理论分析和实验验证。

Result: DANA通过基于模型大小和数据复杂度调整动量超参数，显著改善了损失指数和计算最优缩放行为。

Conclusion: DANA在广泛的数据和目标复杂度范围内优于传统方法，实验验证了其理论和实际优势。

Abstract: We investigate scaling laws for stochastic momentum algorithms with small
batch on the power law random features model, parameterized by data complexity,
target complexity, and model size. When trained with a stochastic momentum
algorithm, our analysis reveals four distinct loss curve shapes determined by
varying data-target complexities. While traditional stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGD-M) yields identical scaling law exponents to SGD,
dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) improves these exponents by
scaling momentum hyperparameters based on model size and data complexity. This
outscaling phenomenon, which also improves compute-optimal scaling behavior, is
achieved by DANA across a broad range of data and target complexities, while
traditional methods fall short. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional
synthetic quadratics validate our theoretical predictions and large-scale text
experiments with LSTMs show DANA's improved loss exponents over SGD hold in a
practical setting.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文分析了贝叶斯概率主成分分析(BPCA)中坐标上升变分推断(CAVI)算法的收敛速度，填补了文献空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率主成分分析(PCA)及其贝叶斯变体(BPCA)在机器学习和统计学中广泛用于降维。BPCA的主要优势在于能够量化不确定性，但其参数通常通过均值场变分推断(如CAVI算法)学习，而CAVI在BPCA中的收敛速度尚未被研究。

Method: 论文首先在单一主成分(PC)模型中通过与传统幂迭代算法的联系证明了精确的指数收敛结果；其次利用新工具证明了任意数量PC模型的CAVI指数收敛性，并引入了一个新的多元正态分布间对称Kullback-Leibler散度下界。

Result: 研究结果表明：1)单一PC情况下CAVI呈指数收敛，且传统PCA可作为BPCA参数的点估计；2)任意数量PC模型也呈现指数收敛，但性质略有不同。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了BPCA中CAVI收敛速度的理论空白，提出的新下界对信息论也有独立价值，为概率PCA的变分推断提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian variant
(BPCA) are widely used for dimension reduction in machine learning and
statistics. The main advantage of probabilistic PCA over the traditional
formulation is allowing uncertainty quantification. The parameters of BPCA are
typically learned using mean-field variational inference, and in particular,
the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm. So far, the
convergence speed of CAVI for BPCA has not been characterized. In our paper, we
fill this gap in the literature. Firstly, we prove a precise exponential
convergence result in the case where the model uses a single principal
component (PC). Interestingly, this result is established through a connection
with the classical $\textit{power iteration algorithm}$ and it indicates that
traditional PCA is retrieved as points estimates of the BPCA parameters.
Secondly, we leverage recent tools to prove exponential convergence of CAVI for
the model with any number of PCs, thus leading to a more general result, but
one that is of a slightly different flavor. To prove the latter result, we
additionally needed to introduce a novel lower bound for the symmetric
Kullback--Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions,
which, we believe, is of independent interest in information theory.

### [363] [Integral Imprecise Probability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16156)
*Siu Lun Chau,Michele Caprio,Krikamol Muandet*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于Choquet积分的积分不精确概率度量（IIPM）框架，用于比较和量化不精确概率模型下的认知不确定性，并验证了其在实际应用中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率模型无法充分捕捉认知不确定性（如知识不完整导致的模糊性），而不精确概率理论提供了更丰富的表示方法。因此，需要一种新的度量框架来比较和量化不精确概率模型下的不确定性。

Method: 论文提出了积分不精确概率度量（IIPM）框架，基于Choquet积分，将经典积分概率度量（IPM）推广到容量（capacities）这一广泛的不精确概率模型类别。

Result: IIPM不仅能够比较不同不精确概率模型，还能量化单一模型内的认知不确定性。通过实验验证，其衍生的最大平均不精确度（MMI）在选择性分类任务中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IIPM框架为不精确概率机器学习（IPML）提供了理论和实践基础，支持在不精确性下对认知不确定性进行量化与比较。

Abstract: Quantifying differences between probability distributions is fundamental to
statistics and machine learning, primarily for comparing statistical
uncertainty. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete
knowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical
probability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing
ambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise
probabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely
on broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond
classical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability
Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical
Integral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class
of IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,
probability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish
conditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of
weak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison
across different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic
uncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model
with its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum
Mean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the
Uncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective
classification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against
established EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle
to scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and
practice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying
epistemic uncertainty under imprecision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在改进传统power prior方法，通过更灵活的α-散度替代KL散度，以更好地控制历史数据对后验分布的影响。

Method: 提出广义power posterior框架，利用Amari的α-散度最小化两个伪后验分布的线性组合，并分析其在概率分布黎曼流形上的几何性质。

Result: 理论证明广义power posterior能通过α参数自适应调整数据权重，且具有黎曼流形上的广义测地线特性。

Conclusion: 广义power prior通过α-散度扩展了传统方法的灵活性，为贝叶斯数据分析提供了新的几何视角和性能提升。

Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate
historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a
power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing
flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the
resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between
two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other
fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior
distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's
$\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this
generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to
adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties
of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a
generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions,
offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒偏移估计器依赖分类器混淆矩阵的逆运算，易受采样噪声和类别相似性影响，导致估计结果脆弱。

Method: 提出GS-B3SE方法，在目标对数先验和混淆矩阵列上施加拉普拉斯-高斯先验，并通过标签相似性图关联二者，采用HMC或快速块牛顿-CG求解后验分布。

Result: 证明了模型的可识别性、N^{-1/2}收缩性、方差随图代数连通性降低的性质，以及对拉普拉斯误设的鲁棒性，并通过信息几何学重新阐释了方法。

Conclusion: GS-B3SE通过概率化建模和图先验约束，显著提升了标签偏移估计的稳定性和泛化能力，统一了现有偏移估计框架。

Abstract: Label shift adaptation aims to recover target class priors when the labelled
source distribution $P$ and the unlabelled target distribution $Q$ share $P(X
\mid Y) = Q(X \mid Y)$ but $P(Y) \neq Q(Y)$. Classical black-box shift
estimators invert an empirical confusion matrix of a frozen classifier,
producing a brittle point estimate that ignores sampling noise and similarity
among classes. We present Graph-Smoothed Bayesian BBSE (GS-B$^3$SE), a fully
probabilistic alternative that places Laplacian-Gaussian priors on both target
log-priors and confusion-matrix columns, tying them together on a
label-similarity graph. The resulting posterior is tractable with HMC or a fast
block Newton-CG scheme. We prove identifiability, $N^{-1/2}$ contraction,
variance bounds that shrink with the graph's algebraic connectivity, and
robustness to Laplacian misspecification. We also reinterpret GS-B$^3$SE
through information geometry, showing that it generalizes existing shift
estimators.

Conclusion: 结论表明，高阶修正和稳健的一步更新方法可以显著提升BN层在适应变化数据分布时的可靠性和性能，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This study develops a higher-order asymptotic framework for test-time
adaptation (TTA) of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics under distribution
shift by integrating classical Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint
approximation techniques with a novel one-step M-estimation perspective. By
analyzing the statistical discrepancy between training and test distributions,
we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the normalized difference in BN means and
obtain an optimal weighting parameter that minimizes the mean-squared error of
the adapted statistic. Reinterpreting BN TTA as a one-step M-estimator allows
us to derive higher-order local asymptotic normality results, which incorporate
skewness and other higher moments into the estimator's behavior. Moreover, we
quantify the trade-offs among bias, variance, and skewness in the adaptation
process and establish a corresponding generalization bound on the model risk.
The refined saddlepoint approximations further deliver uniformly accurate
density and tail probability estimates for the BN TTA statistic. These
theoretical insights provide a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order
corrections and robust one-step updating can enhance the reliability and
performance of BN layers in adapting to changing data distributions.

Conclusion: GAMBITTS通过有效利用生成模型的结构特性，为生成式AI驱动的干预措施提供了一种更高效的决策方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have
enabled the generation of personalized content that adapts to up-to-date user
context. While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit
formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise
classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the
agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response
drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly
account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through
stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated
bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this
action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language
model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models
both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the
delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods.
We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty
in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger
guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS
consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed
treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.

Conclusion: 通过ODE框架揭示了DP-SGD的实际运行机制，为差分隐私机器学习中的超参数选择提供了理论依据，特别验证了实践中高频裁剪策略的有效性。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) linear regression has received significant
attention in the recent theoretical literature, with several works aimed at
obtaining improved error rates. A common approach is to set the clipping
constant much larger than the expected norm of the per-sample gradients. While
simplifying the analysis, this is however in sharp contrast with what empirical
evidence suggests to optimize performance. Our work bridges this gap between
theory and practice: we provide sharper rates for DP stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD) by crucially operating in a regime where clipping happens
frequently. Specifically, we consider the setting where the data is
multivariate Gaussian, the number of training samples $n$ is proportional to
the input dimension $d$, and the algorithm guarantees constant-order zero
concentrated DP. Our method relies on establishing a deterministic equivalent
for the trajectory of DP-SGD in terms of a family of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). As a consequence, the risk of DP-SGD is bounded between two
ODEs, with upper and lower bounds matching for isotropic data. By studying
these ODEs when $n / d$ is large enough, we demonstrate the optimality of
aggressive clipping, and we uncover the benefits of decaying learning rate and
private noise scheduling.

Motivation: 现有文献大多假设布朗参考动力学，隐含限于势驱动动态。本文旨在突破这一限制，研究非平衡系统中非保守力作用下的动态重建，尤其适用于生物系统。

Method: 针对高斯边缘分布，推导了静态和动态Schrödinger桥解的显式表达式；对于一般边缘分布，提出了基于流和得分匹配的无模拟算法mvOU-OTFM。

Result: 在合成和真实单细胞数据实验中，mvOU-OTFM相比竞争方法实现了更高精度，同时训练速度显著更快。

Conclusion: mvOU-OTFM为生物等非平衡系统的动态重建提供了高效解决方案，验证了其在复杂场景下的优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger bridge problem which, given ensemble
measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical
system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most
likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing
literature assume Brownian reference dynamics and are implicitly limited to
potential-driven dynamics. We depart from this regime and consider reference
processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic
drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is
asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system with non-conservative
forces at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which
are naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we
derive explicit expressions that characterise the solution of both the static
and dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM,
a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning the
Schr\"odinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic
and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher
accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to
train.

Conclusion: 论文在广泛设置下建立了均匀泛化误差的集中性和收敛性，为二元线性分类问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their
expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric
argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities
for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input
vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived
concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those
under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost
sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs
in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using
this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under
dimension-free conditions.

Motivation: 研究数据点云的几何结构，明确三种维度概念（环境内在维度、相关秩和潜在内在维度）在数据分析中的作用，并探索其在神经科学中的应用。

Method: 使用广义Hanson-Wright不等式，分析随机函数模型中的数据，研究不同维度概念之间的关系及其对数据几何结构的影响。

Result: 发现当环境内在维度远大于样本量的对数时，持续图能够揭示潜在同源性和流形结构。在神经科学中，首次证明网格细胞活动的环面结构与物理空间等距。

Conclusion: 理论分析为数据几何结构提供了新见解，并在神经科学中验证了网格细胞活动对物理空间的几何忠实表示。

Abstract: We present a generalised Hanson-Wright inequality and use it to establish new
statistical insights into the geometry of data point-clouds. In the setting of
a general random function model of data, we clarify the roles played by three
notions of dimensionality: ambient intrinsic dimension $p_{\mathrm{int}}$,
which measures total variability across orthogonal feature directions;
correlation rank, which measures functional complexity across samples; and
latent intrinsic dimension, which is the dimension of manifold structure hidden
in data. Our analysis shows that in order for persistence diagrams to reveal
latent homology and for manifold structure to emerge it is sufficient that
$p_{\mathrm{int}}\gg \log n$, where $n$ is the sample size. Informed by these
theoretical perspectives, we revisit the ground-breaking neuroscience discovery
of toroidal structure in grid-cell activity made by Gardner et al. (Nature,
2022): our findings reveal, for the first time, evidence that this structure is
in fact isometric to physical space, meaning that grid cell activity conveys a
geometrically faithful representation of the real world.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统计测试框架，用于严格评估GNN显著性图的可靠性，解决了数据重复使用导致的I类错误率膨胀问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）的决策解释性是一个重要挑战，显著性图虽被广泛使用，但其可靠性尤其是对噪声的鲁棒性受到质疑。

Method: 论文利用选择性推断框架，提出了一种统计测试方法，生成统计有效的p值并控制I类错误率，确保识别的显著子图包含有意义的信息而非随机噪声。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效评估GNN解释的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为GNN显著性图的统计验证提供了可靠工具，增强了其解释的可信度。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to
process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN
decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency
maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the
reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of
their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing
framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main
contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused
by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our
method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I
error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful
information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.

Result: 在合成数据集和大规模OOD检测基准测试中，TULiP展现出最先进的性能，尤其是在近分布样本上。

Conclusion: TULiP为OOD检测提供了一种理论驱动的高效不确定性估计方法，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern
out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of
deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a
theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our
approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before
convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such
perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model
parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled
predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification
datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using
large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution
samples.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解不同激活函数下随机神经网络临界点数量随深度增加的变化规律，以及这些变化对网络优化和训练的影响。

Method: 在适当的正则条件下，推导了固定指数和超过给定阈值的临界点数量的精确渐近公式，并通过数值实验支持理论分析。

Result: 研究发现，根据协方差一阶导数的不同值，临界点数量可能收敛、多项式增长或指数增长。对于ReLU等不满足正则条件的激活函数，临界点数量可能随分辨率增加而发散。

Conclusion: 结论表明，神经网络深度和激活函数的选择对临界点数量有显著影响，这对理解网络优化和训练过程具有重要意义。

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random
neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in
the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive
precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed
index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three
distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the
covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge,
grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical
predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide
numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not
satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the
number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating
a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Abstract: Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative
effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and
social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect
fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation
characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND
dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We
also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different
platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose
a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural
networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments
show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake
news detection performance.

Motivation: 现有图粗化方法每次只能生成单一粗化图且需重复计算，且大多无法处理异构图的语义约束。

Result: 在23个真实数据集上验证了方法在保持图结构语义完整性的同时具有优越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次统一支持自适应和异构图粗化，显著提升了计算效率与语义保持能力。

Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique
that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference.
However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must
recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary
overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to
$\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints
of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge
types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable
$\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method
is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a
$\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency
by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first
unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening.
Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic,
heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method
achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic
integrity of the original graph.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI生成内容(AIG)的标识问题，发现现有视觉标识对盲人或视障用户(BLV)效果有限，通过访谈研究提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，平台采用可验证来源机制要求自我披露AIG内容，但现有标识主要依赖视觉提示，对BLV用户效果不佳，存在识别障碍。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈方法，调研了28名参与者（15名视力正常者，13名BLV用户），分析其与AIG标识的交互方式。

Result: 研究发现：1) 视力正常用户依赖视觉/音频线索，BLV用户依赖音频和辅助工具；2) 两类用户均易忽略平台菜单式标识，更多关注标题/评论等内容标识；3) 标识位置不一致、元数据不清晰等问题对BLV用户影响更大。

Conclusion: 提出多维度设计建议，强调需改进AIG标识的可访问性、一致性和认知负荷问题，特别是针对BLV用户的界面适配。

Abstract: AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent
advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly
lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images,
and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are
adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be
self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often
missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them
ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we
conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV
participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through
self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and
practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based
(e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While
sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants
primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability
to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided
indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based
indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges
stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive
overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the
insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical
recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across
several dimensions.

Motivation: 大学生面临日益增加的压力、焦虑和抑郁问题，但传统心理健康服务存在障碍。研究旨在探索移动健康工具在缓解这些症状方面的潜力。

Method: 采用12周随机对照试验，117名参与者分为使用完整mHELP功能的治疗组和仅进行压力记录及心理评估的对照组。通过生理指标和自评量表（GAD-7、PHQ-8、PSS）评估效果，使用广义线性混合模型（GLMM）分析数据。

Result: 治疗组的客观压力指标（MS）显著降低，但主观焦虑（GAD-7）、抑郁（PHQ-8）和压力（PSS）评分无显著组间差异。不过，治疗组的GAD-7和PSS分数出现有临床意义的下降。

Conclusion: 可穿戴设备支持的移动健康工具能有效减少大学生的急性压力，但需延长干预时间和定制化功能以改善慢性症状（如抑郁）。

Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and
depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study
evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health
Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor
and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and
self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),
participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of
interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress
logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of
Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and
analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,
secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also
analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a
substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control
group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective
scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the
treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS
scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth
tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for
extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like
depression.

Abstract: The 3D continuum presents a complex environment that spans the terrestrial,
aerial and space domains, with 6Gnetworks serving as a key enabling technology.
Current AI approaches for network management rely on monolithic models that
fail to capture cross-domain interactions, lack adaptability,and demand
prohibitive computational resources. This paper presents a formal model of
Compound AI systems, introducing a novel tripartite framework that decomposes
complex tasks into specialized, interoperable modules. The proposed modular
architecture provides essential capabilities to address the unique challenges
of 6G networks in the 3D continuum, where heterogeneous components require
coordinated, yet distributed, intelligence. This approach introduces a
fundamental trade-off between model and system performance, which must be
carefully addressed. Furthermore, we identify key challenges faced by Compound
AI systems within 6G networks operating in the 3D continuum, including
cross-domain resource orchestration, adaptation to dynamic topologies, and the
maintenance of consistent AI service quality across heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: PG-ZFO方法能够有效应对DT模型不确定性演化带来的挑战，显著提升用户在DT交互中的QoE。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quality of experience (QoE)-aware resource
allocation problem for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
digital twin (DT) interaction with uncertain evolution. In the considered
system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a
DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink
channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile
users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT
scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming
matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation.
While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution
of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require
us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves.
  To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision
transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial
intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the
prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization
(PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.

Motivation: 当前WiFi室内定位技术受环境干扰和设备差异影响，缺乏统一模型。论文旨在解决这些问题，提升定位精度。

Method: 采用生成预训练Transformer（GPT）模型，利用大语言模型（LLM）捕捉无线遥测中的空间模式，无需手动信号处理。

Result: WiFiGPT在RSSI和FTM上达到亚米级精度，CSI上达到厘米级，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的定位技术潜力巨大，能超越传统方法，适应多样化的实际场景。

Abstract: Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) based indoor positioning is a widely researched area
for determining the position of devices within a wireless network. Accurate
indoor location has numerous applications, such as asset tracking and indoor
navigation. Despite advances in WiFi localization techniques -- in particular
approaches that leverage WiFi telemetry -- their adoption in practice remains
limited due to several factors including environmental changes that cause
signal fading, multipath effects, interference, which, in turn, impact
positioning accuracy. In addition, telemetry data differs depending on the WiFi
device vendor, offering distinct features and formats; use case requirements
can also vary widely. Currently, there is no unified model to handle all these
variations effectively. In this paper, we present WiFiGPT, a Generative
Pretrained Transformer (GPT) based system that is able to handle these
variations while achieving high localization accuracy. Our experiments with
WiFiGPT demonstrate that GPTs, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), can
effectively capture subtle spatial patterns in noisy wireless telemetry, making
them reliable regressors. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our
method matches and often surpasses conventional approaches for multiple types
of telemetry. Achieving sub-meter accuracy for RSSI and FTM and
centimeter-level precision for CSI demonstrates the potential of LLM-based
localisation to outperform specialized techniques, all without handcrafted
signal processing or calibration.

Abstract: The transition from 5G networks to 6G highlights a significant demand for
machine learning (ML). Deep learning models, in particular, have seen wide
application in mobile networking and communications to support advanced
services in emerging wireless environments, such as smart healthcare, smart
grids, autonomous vehicles, aerial platforms, digital twins, and the metaverse.
The rapid expansion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, many with limited
computational capabilities, has accelerated the development of tiny machine
learning (TinyML) and resource-efficient ML approaches for cost-effective
services. However, the deployment of large-scale machine learning (LargeML)
solutions require major computing resources and complex management strategies
to support extensive IoT services and ML-generated content applications.
Consequently, the integration of TinyML and LargeML is projected as a promising
approach for future seamless connectivity and efficient resource management.
  Although the integration of TinyML and LargeML shows abundant potential,
several challenges persist, including performance optimization, practical
deployment strategies, effective resource management, and security
considerations. In this survey, we review and analyze the latest research aimed
at enabling the integration of TinyML and LargeML models for the realization of
smart services and applications in future 6G networks and beyond. The paper
concludes by outlining critical challenges and identifying future research
directions for the holistic integration of TinyML and LargeML in

Abstract: In today's world, modern infrastructures are being equipped with information
and communication technologies to create large IoT networks.
  It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by
detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour
proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations.
  This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links
using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time
series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture
based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the
level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides
competitive results compared to the state of the art while being
computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.

*Ziming liu,Bryan Liu,Alvaro Valcarce,Xiaoli Chu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文展示了如何将大型AI模型（LAMs）集成到6G移动网络中，通过微调解码器转换模型生成符合标准的RRC消息，提升控制平面操作的智能化水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管行业概念（如ETSI的ENI）设想利用LAM驱动的代理实现自适应网络切片和基于意图的管理，但实际应用中仍面临协议理解和现实部署的挑战。

Method: 论文采用参数高效的LoRA方法，在保留ASN.1语法结构的线性化RRC消息上微调解码器转换模型（LLaMA类），以实现对RRC协议状态的组合泛化。

Result: 在3万条现场测试请求-响应对上，8B模型在边缘GPU上实现了与真实消息0.97的中位数余弦相似度，比零样本LLaMA-3 8B基线提升了61%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合RAN特定推理的LAMs可以直接协调控制平面程序，为AI原生无线接口范式奠定了基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出VERDI框架，通过将视觉语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到自动驾驶系统中，以提升决策效率并保持推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在部分可观测和复杂现实环境中的决策能力不足，而人类驾驶员能基于常识进行高效决策。现有方法虽尝试利用视觉语言模型，但存在部署成本高和安全性问题。

Method: VERDI框架在训练时将视觉语言模型的推理过程和常识知识蒸馏到自动驾驶系统的感知、预测和规划模块中，通过潜在空间对齐实现结构化推理。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，VERDI比未嵌入推理的端到端方法性能提升10%，同时保持高推理速度。

Conclusion: VERDI有效提升了自动驾驶系统的决策能力，避免了大型视觉语言模型的高推理成本，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under
partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of
commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information.
Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite
their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to
deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires
more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits
safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for
autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the
reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI
augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning
intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages
with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs.
By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD
stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time
costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do
not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high
inference speed.

TL;DR: 论文提出EasyInsert框架，利用相对位姿预测实现高精度插入任务，仅需少量数据和人工演示即可在杂乱环境中零样本泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有插入任务方法泛化能力差，依赖结构化环境或CAD模型，难以处理初始位姿偏差大、场景杂乱或新物体的问题。

Method: 通过自动化数据收集训练相对位姿预测模型，采用由粗到精的执行策略，仅需5小时训练数据和1次人工演示即可适配新物体。

Result: 在15种新物体（如Type-C线缆）上实现13种零样本90%+成功率，微调后全部物体达90%+成功率。

Conclusion: EasyInsert以最小人工成本实现强泛化能力，为复杂场景下的插入任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Insertion task is highly challenging that requires robots to operate with
exceptional precision in cluttered environments. Existing methods often have
poor generalization capabilities. They typically function in restricted and
structured environments, and frequently fail when the plug and socket are far
apart, when the scene is densely cluttered, or when handling novel objects.
They also rely on strong assumptions such as access to CAD models or a digital
twin in simulation. To address this, we propose EasyInsert, a framework which
leverages the human intuition that relative pose (delta pose) between plug and
socket is sufficient for successful insertion, and employs efficient and
automated real-world data collection with minimal human labor to train a
generalizable model for relative pose prediction. During execution, EasyInsert
follows a coarse-to-fine execution procedure based on predicted delta pose, and
successfully performs various insertion tasks. EasyInsert demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization capability for unseen objects in cluttered
environments, handling cases with significant initial pose deviations while
maintaining high sample efficiency and requiring little human effort. In
real-world experiments, with just 5 hours of training data, EasyInsert achieves
over 90% success in zero-shot insertion for 13 out of 15 unseen novel objects,
including challenging objects like Type-C cables, HDMI cables, and Ethernet
cables. Furthermore, with only one human demonstration and 4 minutes of
automatically collected data for fine-tuning, it reaches over 90% success rate
for all 15 objects.

Motivation: 现有方法在机器人操作中存在空间理解不足的问题，3D点云模型缺乏语义抽象，2D图像编码器难以进行空间推理。

Method: SEM框架包含空间增强器和机器人状态编码器，前者通过3D几何上下文增强视觉表示，后者通过图模型捕捉关节依赖关系。

Result: SEM在多样化任务中表现出色，超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SEM通过增强空间理解和机器人状态编码，显著提升了机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with
strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object
relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point
cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with
spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced
Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly
enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial
enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a
robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased
modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly
improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable
manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Manipulating elasto-plastic objects remains a significant challenge due to
severe self-occlusion, difficulties of representation, and complicated
dynamics. This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object
manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D
occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D
occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these
challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect
full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy
dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction
network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated
dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural
network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex
deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive
control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a
novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve
the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully
shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified
in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出VL-SAFE框架，结合视觉语言模型与世界模型，实现离线安全强化学习，提升自动驾驶策略的安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在自动驾驶中存在样本效率低、泛化能力差的问题，且在线交互学习在安全关键场景中不可接受。现有安全强化学习方法难以准确捕捉复杂驾驶环境中的安全语义。

Method: 构建专家数据离线数据集，利用视觉语言模型标注安全分数；训练世界模型生成模拟轨迹与安全评估，基于此进行演员-评论家学习，优化驾驶策略。

Result: VL-SAFE在样本效率、泛化性、安全性和整体性能上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: VL-SAFE是首个引入视觉语言模型引导的世界模型方法，为安全自动驾驶提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous driving policy learning faces
critical limitations such as low sample efficiency and poor generalization; its
reliance on online interactions and trial-and-error learning is especially
unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods including safe RL
often fail to capture the true semantic meaning of "safety" in complex driving
contexts, leading to either overly conservative driving behavior or constraint
violations. To address these challenges, we propose VL-SAFE, a world
model-based safe RL framework with Vision-Language model
(VLM)-as-safety-guidance paradigm, designed for offline safe policy learning.
Specifically, we construct offline datasets containing data collected by expert
agents and labeled with safety scores derived from VLMs. A world model is
trained to generate imagined rollouts together with safety estimations,
allowing the agent to perform safe planning without interacting with the real
environment. Based on these imagined trajectories and safety evaluations,
actor-critic learning is conducted under VLM-based safety guidance to optimize
the driving policy more safely and efficiently. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VL-SAFE achieves superior sample efficiency, generalization,
safety, and overall performance compared to existing baselines. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces a VLM-guided world
model-based approach for safe autonomous driving. The demo video and code can

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出Raw2Drive，一种基于模型的双流强化学习方法，用于解决端到端自动驾驶中模仿学习的因果混淆和分布偏移问题，并在CARLA Leaderboard 2.0上取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）可以缓解模仿学习（IL）中的因果混淆和分布偏移问题，但在端到端自动驾驶（E2E-AD）中的应用仍存在训练困难。当前基于模型的强化学习（MBRL）方法通常需要特权信息而非原始传感器数据，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了Raw2Drive方法，首先训练一个辅助的特权世界模型和神经规划器，然后通过引导机制训练原始传感器世界模型，确保其与特权世界模型在推演中保持一致，最后利用特权世界模型的先验知识指导原始传感器策略的训练。

Result: Raw2Drive是目前CARLA Leaderboard 2.0上唯一基于强化学习的端到端方法，并取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Raw2Drive通过双流MBRL方法有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的训练难题，展示了强化学习在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and
distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to
end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training
difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and
industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated
promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require
privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap
by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently
train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that
uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor
world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures
consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model
during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior
knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively
guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL
based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统过度依赖预定义地图数据，难以应对道路布局变化、临时绕行或地图缺失等动态场景。

Method: 通过大语言模型生成答案集编程规则，将非正式导航指令转化为结构化逻辑推理框架。

Result: 实验表明该方法支持基于语义的决策，提供可解释的动态导航规划框架。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的ASP规则生成实现了类人类的导航意图表达，增强了自动驾驶的适应能力。

Abstract: Achieving full automation in self-driving vehicles remains a challenge,
especially in dynamic urban environments where navigation requires real-time
adaptability. Existing systems struggle to handle navigation plans when faced
with unpredictable changes in road layouts, spontaneous detours, or missing map
data, due to their heavy reliance on predefined cartographic information. In
this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set
Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into
structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning,
allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on
predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate
ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal
knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation
instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and
explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule
generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable
framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans
communicate navigational intent.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework
for occlusion-aware robotic manipulation in cluttered plant environments. Our
approach enables a robot to interact with a deformable plant to reveal hidden
objects of interest, such as fruits, using multimodal observations. We decouple
the kinematic planning problem from robot control to simplify zero-shot
sim2real transfer for the trained policy. Our results demonstrate that the
trained policy, deployed using our framework, achieves up to 86.7% success in
real-world trials across diverse initial conditions. Our findings pave the way
toward autonomous, perception-driven agricultural robots that intelligently
interact with complex foliage plants to "find the fruit" in challenging
occluded scenarios, without the need for explicitly designed geometric and

Motivation: 当前机器人辅助微创手术完全由训练有素的外科医生手动控制，自动化可以缓解体力负担、重复性任务和外科医生短缺等问题。然而，现有的人工智能方法缺乏可解释性和鲁棒的安全保证，因此需要一种更安全、可解释的自动化方案。

Abstract: Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually
controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for
alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and
shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized
Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite
these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack
explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework
for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of
Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an
Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is
used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to
release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario.
Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place
formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate
our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We
evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera,
and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations,
showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect
Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier
Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety
set in the case of unsafe predictions.

<details>

Motivation: Foley合成在创意产业中有广泛应用，但直接从零开始训练音频生成模型具有挑战性。利用预训练的音频生成模型进行视频同步的Foley合成是一个有吸引力的方向。然而，现有的ControlNet方法在Foley合成中表现不佳，与从零开始的模型存在性能差距。

Method: 论文提出了SpecMaskFoley方法，通过ControlNet引导预训练的SpecMaskGIT模型进行视频同步的Foley合成。为了解决视频特征与SpecMaskGIT的时间-频率特性之间的不一致性，论文引入了一个频率感知的时间特征对齐器，简化了条件机制。

Conclusion: SpecMaskFoley通过频率感知的时间特征对齐器，成功缩小了ControlNet方法与从零开始模型之间的性能差距，为Foley合成任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both
semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad
application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in
the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio
generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for
video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction.
ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative
models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to
handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch
models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted
using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between
ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose
SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward
video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a
single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video
features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a
frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated
conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common
foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform
strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of
ControlNet-based foley synthesis models. Demo page:

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

Result: 研究揭示了自监督学习模型在音乐信息检索中的结构特点和潜在应用，为模型优化和任务适配提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 通过分析MusicFM和MuQ，研究为自监督学习模型在音乐信息检索中的应用提供了理论基础和实践指导，有助于未来更高效地利用这些模型。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models for music information retrieval based on
self-supervised learning (SSL) are becoming popular, showing success in various
downstream tasks. However, there is limited research on the specific meanings
of the encoded information and their applicability. Exploring these aspects can
help us better understand their capabilities and limitations, leading to more
effective use in downstream tasks.
  In this study, we analyze the advanced music representation model MusicFM and
the newly emerged SSL model MuQ. We focus on three main aspects: (i) validating
the advantages of SSL models across multiple downstream tasks, (ii) exploring
the specialization of layer-wise information for different tasks, and (iii)
comparing performance differences when selecting specific layers. Through this
analysis, we reveal insights into the structure and potential applications of
SSL models in music information retrieval.

*Advait Joglekar,Divyanshu Singh,Rooshil Rohit Bhatia,S. Umesh*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合自监督模型的离散语音表示与基于扩散变换器的条件流匹配语音解码器的简单有效方法，用于提升零样本跨语言语音转换性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音转换方法在零样本跨语言场景中表现不佳，难以泛化到未见过的语言和口音。

Method: 采用自监督模型的离散语音表示与非自回归扩散变换器条件流匹配解码器，无需多编码器分离语音特征。

Result: 模型在零样本跨语言场景中表现优异，即使对未见过的语言也有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过纯无文本的自监督方式训练，显著提升了语音转换的零样本跨语言能力。

Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on
improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable
advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot
cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers
of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective
approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised
models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow
matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a
voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our
technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech
features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings
even for unseen languages.

*Stephen Asiedu,David Watson*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: GENESIS是一种基于约束的算法，利用基因型的自然因果优先性推断转录组数据中的祖先关系，解决了高维度和隐藏混杂因素等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多组学数据中的因果发现对理解基因调控机制至关重要，但由于高维度、直接与间接关系区分及隐藏混杂因素等问题，仍具挑战性。

Method: GENESIS通过将基因型作为固定因果锚点，初始化空祖先矩阵，并利用边际和条件独立性测试逐步填充直接、间接或非因果关系。

Result: GENESIS在合成和真实基因组数据集上进行了测试，展示了其在复杂性状中揭示因果通路的潜力。

Conclusion: GENESIS为功能基因组学、药物发现和精准医学提供了强大的因果发现工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the
bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to
high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and
hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from
Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the
natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in
transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start
with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix
and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships
using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests.
By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled
``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search
space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and
real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for
uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to
functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI（尤其是大语言模型）的云端部署存在延迟、成本和隐私问题，而小语言模型在边缘环境能力有限，需要协同解决方案。

Method: 提出边缘与云端资源协同推理策略，结合设计原则和实验分析。

Result: 提供了跨计算连续体部署生成式AI的实用指南。

Conclusion: 协同推理系统能有效平衡生成式AI的性能与资源限制。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), has exposed critical limitations of cloud-centric deployments,
including latency, cost, and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Small Language Models
(SLMs) are emerging as viable alternatives for resource-constrained edge
environments, though they often lack the capabilities of their larger
counterparts. This article explores the potential of collaborative inference

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在边缘计算和云计算环境中部署小型语言模型（SLMs）的性能和成本效益，提出了适应性推理系统的设计见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在各行业的广泛应用，如何在从云端到网络边缘的计算连续体中部署这些服务，以降低成本、减少延迟、提高可靠性和隐私保护成为研究热点。

Method: 研究从单一边缘设备的SLM能力详细基准测试开始，扩展到分布式边缘集群，分析了边缘推理与云计算的交互作用。

Result: 研究发现某些场景下边缘推理能以较低成本提供与云计算相当的性能，而在可扩展性或模型容量受限时，云计算的回退机制则变得必要。

Conclusion: 研究没有提出一刀切的解决方案，而是提供了平台级比较和设计见解，以构建跨异构环境的高效、适应性语言模型推理系统。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving
interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the
cloud to the network edge. This shift aims to reduce costs, lower latency, and
improve reliability and privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs), enabled by
advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to
on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines
the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed
benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to
distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers
comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback
becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than
proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons
and design insights for building efficient, adaptive LM inference systems
across heterogeneous environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的发展，现有的评估基准分散且缺乏系统分类，因此需要一种结构化的方法来评估其性能。

Method: 作者通过全面调研，提出了一个系统分类法，将LALMs的评估分为四个维度：通用听觉感知与处理、知识与推理、对话导向能力、以及公平性、安全性和可信度。

Result: 论文详细概述了每个评估类别，并指出了该领域的挑战，为未来的研究方向提供了见解。

Conclusion: 这是首个专注于LALMs评估的综述，为研究社区提供了清晰的指导，并将持续更新以支持该领域的发展。

Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large
language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to
demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous
benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented
and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive
survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing
them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory
Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented
Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed
overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering
insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing
clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the
surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅限分类，临床洞察不足，且文本无关模型在上下文相关情况下误分类不流畅。

Method: 引入Dysfluent-WFST，结合上游编码器如WavLM，无需额外训练，显式建模发音行为。

Result: 在模拟和真实语音数据上，音素错误率和不流畅检测均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 显式建模发音行为是改进不流畅处理系统的关键，方法轻量、可解释且有效。

Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in
efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and
treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification,
provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify
dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces
Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes
and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with
upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency
detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight,
interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of
pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key
to improving dysfluency processing systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种多模态深度学习方法，通过语音、视频和文本来评估精神分裂症症状严重程度，而非简单分类，以提高临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将精神分裂症评估简化为二分类任务，忽略了症状复杂性，临床价值有限。本研究旨在通过症状严重程度评估提升诊断精度和治疗个性化。

Method: 开发了单模态模型（语音、视频、文本）和多模态融合框架，以提高评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

Result: 多模态方法能够捕捉更详细的症状特征，为精神健康评估提供可扩展的客观工具。

Conclusion: 该研究通过多模态深度学习方法实现了对精神分裂症症状严重程度的精细评估，有助于提升诊断和治疗的个性化水平。

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable
and objective tool for mental health assessment.

TL;DR: Meta-PerSER是一种新型元学习框架，通过个性化适应每位听众的情感解读方式，显著提升了语音情感识别的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音情感识别系统依赖聚合标注，往往忽视个体差异，导致预测不一致。Meta-PerSER旨在解决这一问题，通过个性化适应提升识别效果。

Method: Meta-PerSER采用模型无关元学习（MAML）方法，结合组合集元训练、导数退火和逐层逐步学习率调整，利用预训练自监督模型的鲁棒表示，快速适应个人标注风格。

Result: 在IEMOCAP语料库上的实验表明，Meta-PerSER在已知和未知数据场景下均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Meta-PerSER展示了在个性化情感识别领域的潜力，能够有效适应个体差异，提升识别性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that
personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's
unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated
annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to
inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training,
Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid
adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust
representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first
captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal
annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that
Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen
data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于文本注册的开放词汇关键词检测（KWS）中，音频和文本嵌入通常在音素或话语级别进行比较，但两种模态间的异质性带来了显著挑战。

Method: 提出模态对抗学习（MAL），通过对抗训练模态分类器生成模态不变的嵌入；同时应用DML实现音素级对齐，并比较不同DML目标的效果。

Result: 在WSJ和LibriPhrase数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过减少模态差异和优化嵌入对齐，显著提升了开放词汇关键词检测的性能。

Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic
and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance
level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep
metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in
a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and
text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in
heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality
classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate
modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve
phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive
comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了说话人识别系统在环境不匹配场景下的性能，且无需额外标注或修改现有流程。

Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world
applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We
propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For
training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and
noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively,
via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean
embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are
regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor
any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on
evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method
can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while
retaining performance on conventional scenarios. We publish our code here

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种时间灵活编码（TFC）技术，首次将可变帧率（VFR）引入神经语音编解码器，以提高效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经语音编解码器通常采用恒定帧率（CFR），但语音段的信息密度随时间变化，CFR在比特率和令牌序列长度上并非最优，影响了实时应用的效率。

Method: 提出了时间灵活编码（TFC）技术，通过动态调整帧率，基于时间熵分配帧率，实现可变帧率（VFR）。

Result: 实验表明，采用TFC的编解码器在重建质量上表现优异，具有高灵活性，即使在较低帧率下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: TFC技术为开发低帧率神经语音编解码器提供了新思路，有望提升下游任务的效率。

Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame
mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However,
speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent
intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms
of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time
applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC)
technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for
the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and
dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental
results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with
high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame
rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to
develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream
tasks.

Motivation: 传统主动降噪（ANC）仅抑制外部干扰，而ASE旨在进一步主动调整语音信号，提升清晰度和感知质量。

Method: 采用Transformer-Mamba混合架构，设计任务专用损失函数联合优化干扰抑制与信号增强。

Result: 在去噪、去混响和削峰修复等任务中均超越现有基线，验证了主动调制在复杂声学环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE通过主动信号调制实现了语音质量的全面提升，为语音增强领域提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech
Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on
suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the
speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying
speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual
quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based
architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly
optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms
existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including
denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness
of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Motivation: 尽管基于视觉-语言预训练的基模型在胸片解读中显示出潜力，但其在多样化人群和诊断任务中的实际表现尚未充分评估。

Method: 研究评估了8个胸片诊断模型（5个基模型和3个CNN架构），在6个公共数据集和3个中国医院私有数据集上进行了37项标准化分类任务测试。

Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise
in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across
diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This
study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation
models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational
CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language
foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized
classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and
Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was
assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and
dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy
and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and
structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC:
0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets,
ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed
reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88
+/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings
highlight the value of structured supervision and prompt design in radiologic

Result: 实验表明，MambaStyle在反演精度、编辑质量和计算效率之间达到了优越的平衡，且模型复杂度更低、推理速度更快。

Conclusion: MambaStyle是一种高效的单阶段方法，适用于实时应用，显著提升了GAN反演和编辑的性能与效率。

Abstract: The task of inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space to manipulate
their attributes has been extensively studied. However, existing GAN inversion
methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability,
and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaStyle, an
efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing
that leverages vision state-space models (VSSMs) to address these challenges.
Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture,
enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly
fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a
superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational
efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results
with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for
real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NICU中的永磁MRI扫描仪因低信噪比和有限接收线圈导致扫描时间长，影响对患病新生儿的脑部异常评估。本研究旨在通过扩散概率生成模型加速扫描。

Method: 构建1特斯拉新生儿MRI临床数据集，提出包含多分辨率支持、类别嵌入向量训练、自监督去噪预训练及后验采样平均的四步流程，并通过欠采样实验和临床读片评估验证。

Result: 综合所有数据、去噪预训练和后验采样平均可定量改善重建效果。模型无需重新训练即支持两种加速率，临床读片确认1.5倍欠采样图像满足诊断需求。

Conclusion: 所提出的扩散概率生成模型训练流程能有效处理真实世界数据挑战，有望显著缩短NICU新生儿MRI的扫描时间。

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of
brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners
operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick
infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion
probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting
for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal
MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical
Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our
real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support
varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class
embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and
(4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling
experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed
methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric
neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x
under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior
samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative
model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at
two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that
proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are
adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the
proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan
time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to
support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant
a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational
expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for
improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational
efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it
affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and
therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly.
Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to
graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained
significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical
abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by
determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated.
A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed
approach.

*Nathan Brady,David Tennyson,Thomas Vandermeulen*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文应用监督和无监督机器学习算法研究6维超引力理论的弦景观和沼泽地，通过自动编码器实现数据降维和分类，并构建分类器预测模型一致性。

Method: 方法包括使用自动编码器进行无监督学习，将Gram矩阵数据压缩至2维实现自动分类；同时应用监督学习构建两个分类器，分别预测模型在探针弦插入下的和异常流入下的不一致性。

Result: 结果显示自动编码器能有效聚类相似模型并识别异常模型；监督学习分类器在预测模型一致性和不一致性方面分别达到0.78和0.91的精确度。

Conclusion: 结论表明机器学习算法能有效学习弦景观和沼泽地的复杂特征，自动编码器提供了一种新颖的方法来映射6维超引力理论的景观和沼泽地。

Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions.
Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$
supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients.
Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently
learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an
autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of
these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through
compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent
features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models
which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be
incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the
$\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape
extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two
classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion
(precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable
certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91,
predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these
predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent
models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt
interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a
novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional
supergravity theories.

*Reed Bender,Karina Kofman,Blaise Agüera y Arcas,Michael Levin*

Main category: q-bio.OT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，利用大语言模型分析跨学科专家对生命的定义，揭示了生命定义的连续性和潜在概念空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命定义问题长期困扰科学家和哲学家，随着合成生物学、人工智能和天体生物学的发展，传统生命概念面临挑战，亟需新的方法论来统一不同学科视角。

Method: 采用大语言模型分析专家定义，通过成对相关性分析、凝聚聚类、语义分析和t-SNE投影，构建生命定义的概念图谱。

Result: 研究发现生命定义呈现连续性特征，传统二元分类问题应视为统一潜在概念空间中的差异化视角。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和哲学基本问题提供了还原论与整体论之间的桥梁，计算语义分析可揭示跨学科概念模式，适用于其他争议性定义领域。

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers
for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery
of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear
on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single
definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge
becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it
means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation
analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by
agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection
to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a
continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life,
suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic
problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a
unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between
reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and
philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar
pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the
sciences.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种可解释的机器学习框架，通过全球新闻情绪提取宏观经济alpha因子，使用FinBERT处理新闻数据并构建情绪指数，结合XGBoost预测外汇和债券收益，取得了显著的投资回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何利用全球新闻情绪数据，结合领域特定的自然语言处理和可解释的机器学习方法，为宏观经济预测提供新的alpha来源。

Method: 使用FinBERT处理GDELT全球新闻数据，构建包含平均情绪、离散度和事件影响的每日情绪指数，并采用XGBoost分类器（基准为逻辑回归）预测次日EUR/USD、USD/JPY和10年期美国国债期货的收益。

Result: 严格的样本外回测显示，XGBoost策略在成本调整后表现卓越：外汇市场的夏普比率达5.87和4.65，债券市场为4.65；外汇年复合增长率超50%，债券超22%。SHAP分析确认情绪离散度和文章影响是关键预测特征。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合领域特定的自然语言处理和可解释的机器学习方法，能够提供强大且可解释的宏观经济alpha来源。

Abstract: This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to
extract macroeconomic alpha from global news sentiment. We process the Global
Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project's worldwide news feed
using FinBERT -- a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) based model pretrained on finance-specific language -- to construct
daily sentiment indices incorporating mean tone, dispersion, and event impact.
These indices drive an XGBoost classifier, benchmarked against logistic
regression, to predict next-day returns for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and 10-year U.S.
Treasury futures (ZN). Rigorous out-of-sample (OOS) backtesting (5-fold
expanding-window cross-validation, OOS period: c. 2017-April 2025) demonstrates
exceptional, cost-adjusted performance for the XGBoost strategy: Sharpe ratios
achieve 5.87 (EUR/USD), 4.65 (USD/JPY), and 4.65 (Treasuries), with respective
compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) exceeding 50% in Foreign Exchange (FX) and
22% in bonds. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) affirm that sentiment
dispersion and article impact are key predictive features. Our findings
establish that integrating domain-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with interpretable ML offers a potent and explainable source of macro alpha.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理的机器学习方法，用于预测地幔对流中的蠕变流速，从而绕过数值求解斯托克斯问题，显著提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地幔对流模拟是理解岩石行星演化的关键工具，但由于输入参数未知、传输性质对压力和温度的非线性依赖以及数十亿年的长时间积分，数值求解器面临巨大计算挑战。

Method: 采用基于物理的机器学习方法，通过卷积神经网络预测蠕变流速，并结合有限体积求解器对温度场进行平流和扩散，实现自回归推演。训练仅需少量模拟的温度-速度快照（94个）。

Conclusion: 该方法在未见过的情况下展示了其优势和局限性，为地幔对流模拟提供了一种高效的计算替代方案。

Abstract: Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date,
providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex
combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have
been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various
domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense
sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale
models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly
challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum
optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN
optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for
compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we
explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of
convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate
model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing
devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that
AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments
demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms
classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in
terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和提升量子对抗鲁棒性建立了关键实验框架，为安全可靠的量子机器学习应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we
report the first systematic experimental robustness benchmark for 20-qubit
quantum neural network (QNN) classifiers executed on a superconducting
processor. Our benchmarking framework features an efficient adversarial attack
algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of
adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that
adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by
regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness.
Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial
robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to
inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from
our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the
theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the
attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds.
This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and
improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and
reliable QML applications.

Conclusion: MDtrajNet-1突破了传统MD的速度限制，为高效、可扩展的原子尺度模拟开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of
atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits
simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that
directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force
calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to
two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by
machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant
neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong
accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both
known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated
by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the
conventional ab initio MD. The model's flexible design supports diverse
application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary
conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of
conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable
atomistic simulations.

Conclusion: 通过高维特征融合和多线性学习，该方法有效提升了行人重识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in
computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person
Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target
individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a
robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research
in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and
representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably
discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are
modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional
Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced
to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even
though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we
employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace
learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently
facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in
high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through
experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源视觉推理模型仅使用自然语言生成推理内容，缺乏视觉信息的显式整合，导致推理链不够清晰和视觉基础不足。

Method: GRIT引入了一种基于GRPO算法的强化学习方法GRPO-GR，生成结合自然语言和边界框坐标的推理链，无需标注推理链或边界框标签。

Result: GRIT仅需20个图像-问题-答案三元组即可高效训练模型，生成的推理链既连贯又具有视觉基础。

Conclusion: GRIT成功统一了推理和视觉基础能力，为多模态语言模型的视觉推理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to
producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling
reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning
models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking
explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to
produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this
end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method
for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning
paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural
language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to
regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning
process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,
GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused
on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which
eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit
bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,
requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to
produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful
unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment
industry, optimizing game development workflows has become essential for the
sector's sustained growth. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
offer considerable potential to automate and enhance various aspects of game
development, particularly Quality Assurance (QA), which remains one of the

accurately evaluate the performance of VLMs in video game QA tasks and
determine their effectiveness in handling real-world scenarios, there is a
clear need for standardized benchmarks, as existing benchmarks are insufficient
to address the specific requirements of this domain. To bridge this gap, we
introduce VideoGameQA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a wide array

testing, needle-in-a-haystack tasks, glitch detection, and bug report
generation for both images and videos of various games. Code and data are

Conclusion: 像素空间推理框架有效提升视觉语言模型性能，证明了视觉操作在复杂视觉任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning
process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its
effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we
introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel
framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual
reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable
VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby
enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space
reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the
model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly
introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a
two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on
synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual
operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a
curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space
reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can
interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos
to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning
benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on
TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy
achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the
importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially
in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal
prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models
with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal
prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in
domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of
Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification
performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while
accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision
transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including
HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning
approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance
domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore
that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an
improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong
likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular
models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal
prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for
challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

*Zhenglin Hua,Jinghan He,Zijun Yao,Tianxu Han,Haiyun Guo,Yuheng Jia,Junfeng Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）潜在方向的训练免费方法SSL，用于减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉现象，同时保持跨模型架构的可迁移性和低时间开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成的文本与视觉输入不一致。现有方法计算成本高且耗时，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）识别与幻觉或实际密切相关的语义方向，提出SSL方法，通过SAE潜在方向调整LVLM的内部表示，以精确干预幻觉现象。

Result: 实验表明，SSL在减少幻觉方面显著优于现有解码方法，同时保持跨模型架构的可迁移性，且额外时间开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: SSL是一种高效且无需训练的方法，能有效减少LVLM中的幻觉现象，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning.
However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent
with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications.
Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external
knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which
require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore
more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations.
Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently
suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal
semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify
semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality,
realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our
analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we
identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory
direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering
LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on
SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding
approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability
across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

*Zirui Pang,Haosheng Tan,Yuhan Pu,Zhijie Deng,Zhouan Shen,Keyu Hu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出REVEAL框架，结合先进视觉语言模型和标签清理方法，系统性解决图像分类基准数据集中的噪声标签和缺失标签问题，显著提升6个基准测试集的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类基准数据集（如CIFAR、MNIST、ImageNet）普遍存在噪声标签和缺失标签问题，导致模型评估不公平。现有方法主要关注噪声标签，而缺失标签问题被忽视。

Method: 整合预训练视觉语言模型（如LLaVA、BLIP）与标签清理方法（如Docta、Cleanlab），通过置信度预测和共识过滤检测噪声标签和缺失标签，并提供概率化软标签结果。

Result: REVEAL显著改善了6个基准测试集的质量，通过人工验证证明其标签与人类判断高度一致，实现了更准确的模型比较。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据集修复提供了系统解决方案，揭示了视觉语言模型在标签修正中的潜力与局限，推动了图像分类评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet
serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning
efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often
contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple
classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons
and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on
noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked.
Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named
REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g.,
LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods
(e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and
missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL
detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from
various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed
predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough
analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image
classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of
dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals
missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with
likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the
quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and
enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

*Benjamin Schneider,Dongfu Jiang,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuickVideo通过系统-算法协同设计加速长视频理解，解决视频解码和预填充的瓶颈，显著降低延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解在视频监控、会议总结等应用中至关重要，但现有方法因视频解码和预填充的高计算成本而难以实时处理。

Method: 提出QuickVideo，包含QuickDecoder（并行视频解码）、QuickPrefill（KV缓存剪枝的高效预填充）和CPU-GPU重叠处理。

Result: 实验表明，QuickVideo显著减少长视频处理时间，并在不同时长和采样率下表现良好。

Conclusion: QuickVideo使长视频处理在有限硬件上可行，支持实时高质量视频理解。

Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world
applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational
lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally
prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential
video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can
take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up
to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and
memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a
system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video
understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three
key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that
achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals
processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method
using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an
overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.
Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video
inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited
hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and
sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

*Mohammad Reza Taesiri,Brandon Collins,Logan Bolton,Viet Dac Lai,Franck Dernoncourt,Trung Bui,Anh Totti Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了83k个图像编辑请求，发现当前AI编辑器仅能处理约33%的请求，且在低创意精确编辑任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI（如GPT-4o）在自动化日常图像编辑任务中的潜力，了解用户最常见的编辑需求及AI编辑器的当前能力限制。

Method: 通过分析Reddit社区12年间的83k个编辑请求和305k个专业编辑作品，结合人类和VLM评估AI编辑器的表现。

Result: 仅33%的请求能被最佳AI编辑器（如GPT-4o）成功处理，AI在精确编辑和保留人物/动物身份方面表现不佳，且常进行非请求的修饰。

Conclusion: AI编辑器在创意任务上表现优于精确编辑，需改进身份保留和请求遵循能力；VLM评估与人类偏好存在差异。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image
editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25,
2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of
editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the
subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly
creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and
the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw
lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests
can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present
a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the
past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k
PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of
requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on
low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended
tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and
frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM
judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits
more than human edits. Code and qualitative examples are available at:

*Chaoya Jiang,Yongrui Heng,Wei Ye,Han Yang,Haiyang Xu,Ming Yan,Ji Zhang,Fei Huang,Shikun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-R$^3$框架通过区域识别与推理增强MLLM，实现动态视觉证据聚焦，在复杂任务中取得新突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的多模态大语言模型在生成长文本推理链时表现良好，但在需要动态迭代聚焦视觉区域以实现文本推理与视觉证据精准对接的复杂任务中仍存在困难。

Method: 提出VLM-R$^3$框架，结合区域条件强化策略优化（R-GRPO）训练范式，并构建VLIR语料库提供区域选择与文本论证的步骤级监督。

Result: 在MathVista、ScienceQA等基准测试中，VLM-R$^3$在零样本和少样本设置下达到新最优性能，尤其在需要精细空间推理或视觉线索提取的任务中提升显著。

Conclusion: VLM-R$^3$通过动态视觉区域聚焦与推理链交织，显著提升了多模态复杂任务的解决能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in
generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle
with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and
revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning
in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and
\textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i)
decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine
\emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the
relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core
of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization
(R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative
regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and
integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To
bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual
Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on
region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista,
ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on
questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue
extraction.

*Yan Zhao,Zhengxue Cheng,Junxuan Zhang,Qunshan Gu,Qi Wang,Li Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualComp是一种轻量级、统一的双模态无损压缩器，适用于图像和文本数据，通过特定结构优化和参数共享实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型无损压缩器多为单模态设计，多模态数据需独立模型，灵活性不足；而多模态大模型虽能统一压缩，但复杂度高难以实用。

Method: 基于轻量级主干网络，提出模态统一分词、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由专家混合三项结构增强，结合重参数化训练策略。

Result: 在桌面CPU上实现近实时推理（200KB/s），参数量远低于SOTA方法却达到同等压缩性能，单模态变体在Kodak数据集上以1.2%模型尺寸超越之前最佳图像压缩器9%。

Conclusion: DualComp通过模态特定与共享参数的协同设计，首次实现了轻量级双模态无损压缩，为多模态压缩提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality,
requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility.
However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical
properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack
modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive
complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus
on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the
first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor.
Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural
enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization,
modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing
mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to
boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and
shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time
inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp
achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for
both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses
the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just
1.2% of the model size.

TL;DR: DriveMoE提出了一种基于混合专家（MoE）架构的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过视觉和动作MoE模块动态选择相关摄像头和专家模块，有效处理复杂驾驶场景，并在Bench2Drive评估中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶模型在处理复杂场景（如激进转弯）时存在模式平均问题，而MoE架构在LLMs中的成功表明参数专业化能提升扩展性。

Method: 在Drive-π0基线模型上添加视觉MoE（动态路由选择摄像头）和动作MoE（激活行为专用专家模块），模拟人类驾驶的注意力机制和行为专业化。

Result: DriveMoE在Bench2Drive闭环评估中取得SOTA性能，验证了视觉与动作MoE结合的有效性。

Conclusion: DriveMoE通过MoE架构实现场景和技能的动态专业化，为自动驾驶任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of
multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving
scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In
this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a
Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is
built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from
the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE
to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to
the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition,
where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than
exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE
by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different
driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able
to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like
existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness
of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release
our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前基于CLIP的文本到图像检索器在处理属性聚焦查询时表现不佳，提出使用可提示图像嵌入方法提升性能，并通过预处理和线性近似加速策略优化实际应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像检索器（如CLIP）在处理需要关注特定视觉属性的查询时表现不均衡且效果较差，因为它们主要关注全局语义而忽略了细节。这促使研究者探索更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出使用基于多模态检索器的可提示图像嵌入方法，通过突出所需属性来提升检索性能，并采用预处理和线性近似策略加速计算。

Result: 实验表明，可提示图像嵌入方法显著提升了检索性能，预处理策略在预定义提示下Recall@5提高了15%，线性近似在推理时可用提示下提升了8%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通用图像嵌入对于属性聚焦查询并非最优解，而可提示图像嵌入方法能有效解决这一问题，并通过加速策略增强了实际应用性。

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide
crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of
this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual
attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling
attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with
9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like
retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot
ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image
embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other
details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with
this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image
embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose
to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,
which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for
deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base
retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two
acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear
approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5
when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when
prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced
LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding
promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms
to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant
improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and
decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with
language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work
presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA)
that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside
YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes
a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced
performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also
enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and
providing valuable support for verification and increased output reliability

TL;DR: 提出OViP框架，通过动态构建对比训练数据减少大视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持多模态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义或随机编辑的负样本，无法反映模型实际错误，限制了训练效果。

Method: 基于模型自身幻觉输出动态构建对比数据，利用扩散模型合成负样本，实时生成相关监督信号。

Result: 实验表明OViP有效减少幻觉，同时保持核心多模态能力。

Conclusion: OViP框架通过失败驱动训练自适应对齐文本和视觉偏好，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination,
often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches
advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate
hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative
samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.
In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)
framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the
model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between
sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion
model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This
failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual
preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better
capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.
Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP
effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPQVAR是一种高效的浮点量化框架，通过算法和硬件协同设计，显著降低了VAR模型的存储和计算成本，同时提升了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中表现出色，但其大参数规模和计算成本阻碍了在边缘设备上的部署。为了降低内存和计算成本，作者提出了FPQVAR框架。

Method: FPQVAR采用双格式量化处理高度不平衡的输入激活，提出组级Hadamard变换和GHT感知可学习变换应对时变异常通道，并设计了首个低比特浮点量化器和乘法器。

Result: 实验表明，FPQVAR在4位量化下显著提升了FID和IS分数，6位量化性能接近FP16模型。FPGA加速器吞吐量提升3.1倍，能效优于整数加速器和GPU基线。

Conclusion: FPQVAR通过算法和硬件协同设计，有效解决了VAR模型的量化挑战，显著提升了性能和能效，为边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image
generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a
set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image
quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models.
However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on
edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an
efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR
featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first
identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual
Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further
propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable
Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware
level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup
tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring
low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive
experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our
proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from
10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in
image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from
low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic
understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based
retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image
characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely
on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph
pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based
supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval
reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based
unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled
training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and
runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and
supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as
a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,
replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in
image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability
of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph
generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in
counterfactual image retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的时空特征融合框架TSFmicro，用于动态微表情识别（DMER），通过结合Retention Network和基于transformer的网络，有效捕捉和融合时空关系，提升了微表情识别的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情作为真实情感的窗口，其短暂性和高度局部性使得准确识别极具挑战性，即使是专业人士的识别准确率也仅为50%。因此，需要探索多模态融合技术来提升动态微表情识别的效果。

Method: 论文提出了TSFmicro框架，整合了Retention Network（RetNet）和基于transformer的DMER网络，通过并行时空融合方法在高维特征空间融合时空信息，形成互补的'where-how'关系，为模型提供更丰富的语义信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSFmicro方法在三个公认的微表情数据集上表现优异，优于其他当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TSFmicro框架通过有效的时空特征融合，显著提升了动态微表情识别的性能，为微表情分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed
through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a
genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the
transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant
challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of
micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In
order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of
dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques,
with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal
features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion
framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network
(RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient
micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and
spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion
method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal
information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary
"where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic
information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary
state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three
well-recognised micro-expression datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时计算成本过高，难以扩展。

Method: DeCafNet引入侧边编码器进行密集特征提取，并生成显著性图以识别最相关的片段，再由专家编码器处理。

Result: 实验表明，DeCafNet减少计算量达47%，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeCafNet在效率和性能上均达到新高度，为长视频时间定位提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments
within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content
retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips
and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to
scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of
clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach
employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency
without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick
encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a
resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most
relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively
leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different
temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines
them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement
for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming
existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both
efficiency and performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索视觉模型是否能够学习并编码ImageNet分类学层次结构，从而理解模型内部表示与物体类别层次之间的关系。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）作为解释工具，分析视觉模型（特别是DINOv2）的内部表示，研究其是否与ImageNet分类学结构对齐。

Result: 结果显示SAEs能够揭示模型激活中的层次关系，表明模型内部隐含了分类学结构。同时，研究发现DINOv2模型中类别信息通过每一层逐步增强。

Conclusion: 该研究为系统分析视觉模型的层次表示提供了框架，并展示了SAEs在探索深度网络语义结构中的潜力。

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories,
offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned
by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how
vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as
an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the
discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to
vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the
ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that
SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an
implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these
representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model
DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize
hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token
through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic
hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the
potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

TL;DR: 提出Redemption Score混合框架，通过三重信号评估图像描述质量，优于现有方法且无需任务特定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标难以全面评估图像描述的视觉语义和语言语用，需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 结合三种信号：(1) MID全局对齐，(2) DINO视觉相似性，(3) BERTScore文本相似性，进行校准融合。

Result: 在Flickr8k上Kendall-τ达56.43，优于12种方法，与人类判断相关性更高。

Conclusion: Redemption Score通过有效结合视觉语义和语言解释性，提供了更鲁棒和细致的评估。

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual
semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most
metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks
image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual
Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment,
(2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual
grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human
references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to
offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score
achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and
demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring
task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced
evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic
interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual
Captions and MS COCO datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出Circle-RoPE方法，解决视觉语言模型中旋转位置编码（RoPE）引入的跨模态位置偏差问题，通过圆形轨迹映射图像标记索引，减少虚假对齐，并采用分层策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的旋转位置编码（RoPE）在视觉语言模型（LVLM）中会引入跨模态位置偏差，导致图像标记与文本标记之间出现虚假对齐，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出Per-Token Distance（PTD）度量跨模态位置编码独立性，并设计Circle-RoPE方法，将图像标记索引映射到与文本标记正交的圆形轨迹上，同时采用分层策略结合不同RoPE变体。

Result: 实验表明，Circle-RoPE有效减少了跨模态位置偏差，同时保留了图像空间信息，提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: Circle-RoPE为视觉语言模型提供了更鲁棒和灵活的位置编码框架，解决了跨模态偏差问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding
relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when
extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce
unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative
positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing
spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the
same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct
positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address
this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for
quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.
Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme
that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the
linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This
configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all
image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving
intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a
staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers.
This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby
enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while
reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible
positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人类与深度学习模型在物体表征上的相似性，发现CLIP模型在细粒度和粗粒度层面均与人类表征高度匹配，而自监督模型仅能捕捉粗粒度类别结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类如何获取物体内部表征的机制尚不明确。深度神经网络（DNNs）因其优化过程中产生的与人类相似的表征，成为研究这一问题的有力工具。然而，先前研究未明确这种相似性是仅存在于粗粒度类别层面，还是延伸至更细粒度的细节。

Method: 研究采用基于Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的无监督对齐方法，比较人类和模型在细粒度和粗粒度层面的物体表征。该方法独特之处在于能估计人类与模型表征中每个物体之间的最优细粒度映射。

Result: 使用THINGS数据集中1,854个物体的人类相似性判断，发现CLIP训练的模型在细粒度和粗粒度层面均与人类表征高度匹配。自监督模型在两个层面匹配有限，但仍能形成反映人类粗粒度类别结构的物体聚类。

Conclusion: 研究结果为语言信息在获取精确物体表征中的作用提供了新见解，并展示了自监督学习在捕捉粗粒度类别结构方面的潜力。

Abstract: The learning mechanisms by which humans acquire internal representations of
objects are not fully understood. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a
useful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal
representations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their
objective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with
various learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -
acquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity
to human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to
finer details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on
Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object
representations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique
feature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity
analysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the
representation of each object in human and model representations. We used this
unsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation
of each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding
representation of the same object in models. Using human similarity judgments
of 1,854 objects from the THINGS dataset, we find that models trained with CLIP
consistently achieve strong fine- and coarse-grained matching with human object
representations. In contrast, self-supervised models showed limited matching at
both fine- and coarse-grained levels, but still formed object clusters that
reflected human coarse category structure. Our results offer new insights into
the role of linguistic information in acquiring precise object representations
and the potential of self-supervised learning to capture coarse categorical
structures.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种端到端的深度学习模型，用于联合估计心脏电影MRI图像的组配准和分割，以提高心脏功能评估的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 左心室射血分数（LVEF）是评估心脏泵血功能的常用指标，但其受观察者间变异性和前后负荷条件的影响，且在某些心脏疾病中可能无法准确反映功能障碍。心肌应变和应变率作为替代指标，可以提供相对负荷独立的心肌收缩力评估。现有方法通常分别进行LVEF和应变的计算，可能限制心脏功能的全面评估。

Method: 研究提出了一种端到端的深度学习模型，称为解剖引导的深度组配准网络（Deep GW），用于联合估计心脏电影MRI图像的组配准和分割。该模型在374名受试者的四腔视图电影MRI图像序列上进行了训练和验证。

Result: 与传统的elastix组配准和两种基于深度学习的方法相比，所提出的模型在性能上有所提升，并显著减少了计算时间。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的端到端深度学习模型能够有效联合估计心脏电影MRI图像的组配准和分割，为心脏功能的全面评估提供了一种高效且准确的方法。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for
the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most
commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors
such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load
conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac
dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart
failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a
relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility
is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with
myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac
function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from
cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain
calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential
frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are
often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac
function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and
segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep
GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view
cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with
conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that
the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation
time.

Conclusion: 放射报告的显式整合能有效提升医学VQA任务性能，两阶段生成框架为临床影像时序分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Chest X-ray (CXR) Visual Question Answering
(VQA), addressing both single-image image-difference questions. Single-image
questions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR ("What abnormalities are
seen in image X?"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal
CXRs acquired at different time points ("What are the differences between image
X and Y?"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can
enhance the performance of VQA models. While previous approaches have
demonstrated the utility of radiology reports during the pre-training phase, we
extend this idea by showing that the reports can also be leveraged as
additional input to improve the VQA model's predicted answers. First, we
propose a unified method that handles both types of questions and
auto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model
is provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is
provided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time
points, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking
inspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance
on the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module
with a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA
model is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer
Generation (AG). Our results demonstrate that incorporating predicted radiology
reports as evidence to the AG model enhances performance on both single-image
and image-difference questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the
Medical-Diff-VQA dataset.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large

effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing

tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories
over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the
question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and
then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over
the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories
across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares
reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution
advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more
accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of
policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning
benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be

Conclusion: DigiFakeAV数据集揭示了当前检测技术的不足，DigiShield通过细粒度时空-音频特征融合为深度伪造防御提供新基准。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise
to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based
digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such
models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal
control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to
existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the
first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion
models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo,
etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising
60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin
tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data
diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged
and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection
models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the
challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose
DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal
fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the
semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on
both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method
effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the
temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

Conclusion: TextureSAM有效缓解了SAM的形状偏差，为纹理敏感任务提供了更优的分割解决方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object
segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are
predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which
introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image.
This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material
classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object
boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over
textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which
performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this,
we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation
techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture
features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we
guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the
inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both
natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation
datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation
model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many
aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters
and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose
Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization

Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with
the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource
constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the
feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across
diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon,

### [453] [Accelerating Targeted Hard-Label Adversarial Attacks in Low-Query Black-Box Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16313)
*Arjhun Swaminathan,Mete Akgün*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TEA的新型对抗攻击方法，利用目标图像的边缘信息生成对抗样本，在低查询量场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前黑盒攻击方法主要依赖决策边界的几何特性，而忽略了图像本身的信息，导致在目标攻击中效果受限。

Method: TEA通过结合目标图像的边缘信息，生成更接近源图像但仍能误导分类器的对抗样本。

Result: TEA在低查询量场景下（减少近70%查询）表现优于现有方法，并为几何攻击提供了更好的初始化。

Conclusion: TEA通过利用图像边缘信息，显著提升了黑盒目标攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce
misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is
accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific
target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions.
Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the
decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than
incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose
Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge
information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an
adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the
desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly
70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world
applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by
efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved
target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

*Suhao Yu,Haojin Wang,Juncheng Wu,Cihang Xie,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了首个评估医学视觉问答中多图像推理能力的基准MedFrameQA，发现现有多模态大模型在该任务上表现不佳，准确率普遍低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准多关注单图像分析，而临床诊断通常需要比较多张图像。为更好模拟这一流程，研究者构建了首个专注于多图像推理的医学VQA基准。

Method: 1) 开发自动化流程从医疗视频提取时序连贯帧并构建逻辑递进的VQA条目 2) 采用多阶段过滤策略（包括模型筛选和人工审核）确保数据质量

Result: 测试10个先进多模态LLM显示：所有模型表现不佳（准确率<50%），且准确率随图像数量增加而波动；模型常见错误包括忽略关键发现、跨图像证据整合错误和错误传递

Conclusion: 该工作有望推动基于临床的多图像推理研究，加速诊断AI系统发展，同时揭示了当前模型在复杂医学推理任务上的重大局限性。

Abstract: Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet
clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a
diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the
first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.
To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an
automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos
and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)
a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,
to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting
dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in
3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question
is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced
Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit
reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that
all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy
fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis
further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate
evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning
chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and
modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,
multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种基于扩散模型的语义一致风格迁移技术（CACTI和CACTIF），通过类感知方法缩小合成数据与真实数据间的领域差距，提升视觉模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于领域差距，基于合成数据训练的语义分割模型在真实图像上表现不佳，尤其是在标注数据稀缺的恶劣条件下。论文旨在利用无需训练的扩散模型提升模型在合成数据上的性能。

Method: 提出两种技术：类自适应实例归一化与交叉注意力（CACTI）及其带选择性注意力过滤的扩展（CACTIF）。CACTI基于语义类别选择性应用统计归一化，CACTIF则通过特征相似性过滤交叉注意力图，避免弱对应区域产生伪影。

Result: 在GTA5到Cityscapes/ACDC的实验中，该方法生成图像质量更高（FID分数更低），内容保持更好，有效缩小了合成到真实的领域差距。

Conclusion: 类感知的扩散风格迁移能有效桥接合成与真实数据间的领域差距，即使目标领域数据极少，也能推动鲁棒感知系统在挑战性现实应用中的发展。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly
on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions
where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate
realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such
diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on
synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent
style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance
Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective
attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization
selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters
cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in
regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style
characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,
unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without
constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target
domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID
scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware
diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain
gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems
for challenging real-world applications. The source code is available at:

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence in sports analytics has
transformed soccer video understanding, enabling real-time, automated insights
into complex game dynamics. Traditional approaches rely on isolated data
streams, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the full context of a match.
To address this, we introduce SoccerChat, a multimodal conversational AI
framework that integrates visual and textual data for enhanced soccer video
comprehension. Leveraging the extensive SoccerNet dataset, enriched with jersey
color annotations and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts,
SoccerChat is fine-tuned on a structured video instruction dataset to
facilitate accurate game understanding, event classification, and referee
decision making. We benchmark SoccerChat on action classification and referee
decision-making tasks, demonstrating its performance in general soccer event
comprehension while maintaining competitive accuracy in referee decision
making. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal integration in
advancing soccer analytics, paving the way for more interactive and explainable
AI-driven sports analysis. https://github.com/simula/SoccerChat

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SPIN方法，通过选择性抑制注意力头减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉现象，同时保持推理速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在多模态理解任务中表现出色，但常产生与视觉内容不符的幻觉文本。现有方法虽能减少幻觉，但显著增加延迟。

Method: SPIN是一种任务无关的注意力头抑制策略，通过分析发现幻觉与特定注意力头相关，选择性抑制对图像关注度低的注意力头，保留前K个注意力头。

Result: 在视觉问答和图像描述任务中，SPIN将幻觉分数降低至2.7倍，保持F1分数，并将吞吐量提高1.8倍。

Conclusion: SPIN有效减少LVLMs的幻觉现象，且不增加计算或延迟开销，为模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large
vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating
texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing
hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase
in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided
head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,
without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate
whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our
analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of
attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query
token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to
image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations
on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the
efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining
F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is

Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中表现出色，但其空间理解仅限于单幅图像，无法满足机器人等需要多帧推理的实际应用需求。

Method: 提出一个框架，整合深度感知、视觉对应和动态感知，并构建MultiSPA数据集（包含2700多万个样本）和综合基准测试。

Result: 提出的Multi-SpatialMLLM模型在基线测试和专有系统上均取得显著提升，展示了可扩展、可泛化的多帧推理能力，并在机器人任务中表现出多任务优势和新兴能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了MLLMs的多帧空间理解能力，为机器人等实际应用提供了有力支持，并展示了多任务协同和新兴能力的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual
tasks, yet their spatial understanding remains limited to single images,
leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that
require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip
MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth
perception, visual correspondence, and dynamic perception. Central to our
approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than
27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks
under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves
significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating
scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task
benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging
scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward
annotator for robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于图像的大语言模型的安全风险已被广泛研究，但其视频对应物（Video LLMs）的安全问题仍未被充分探讨。为了系统研究这一问题，作者构建了首个大规模、文化多样的视频安全基准。

Method: 提出了VideoSafety-R1框架，包括两个创新：(1) 警报令牌引导的安全微调（AT-SFT），通过多任务目标实现跨模态的显式伤害感知；(2) 安全引导的GRPO，通过基于规则奖励的动态策略优化增强防御推理。

Result: 该框架在VSB-Eval-HH上实现了65.1%的改进，在图像安全数据集MMBench、VLGuard和FigStep上分别提高了59.1%、44.3%和15.0%。

Conclusion: VideoSafety-R1框架将安全对齐从被动伤害识别转变为主动推理，显著提升了视频大语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been
extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain
critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce
\textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse
benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and
spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We
reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an
average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}
To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage
framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1)
Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens
into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across
modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances
defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards
derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift
safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The
resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves
by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard,
and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary
materials.} \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful

Motivation: 近年来，强化学习在提升大语言模型的思维链推理能力方面取得了显著进展，但在自回归图像生成领域的应用仍缺乏深入分析。该论文旨在填补这一空白，探索RL算法在该领域的表现及其面临的独特挑战。

Method: 论文首次对GRPO和DPO算法在自回归图像生成中的表现进行了全面研究，评估了它们在领域内外的性能，并分析了不同奖励模型对算法能力的影响。此外，还系统探索了三种常见的扩展策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更有效的RL算法以实现自回归图像生成中鲁棒的思维链推理开辟了新路径，有望启发未来的相关工作。

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central
to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image
generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents
unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass
ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and
designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler
rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these
explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific
challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this
gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO
algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain
performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of
different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal
that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward
models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially
enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,
we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both
their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into
efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a
new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms
to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image
generation. Code is released at

Method: 使用MedMultiPoints多模态数据集，将任务转化为适合视觉语言推理的指令提示，并采用低秩适应（LoRA）方法微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 多任务训练提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，例如减少了计数平均绝对误差（MAE）并提高了匹配准确率，但也导致边缘案例的零预测增加，可靠性有所下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过指令微调通用VLM可以学习复合诊断推理模式，生成可解释的结构化输出，为可解释且多功能的医学AI迈出了有希望的一步。

Abstract: We investigate fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-task
medical image understanding, focusing on detection, localization, and counting
of findings in medical images. Our objective is to evaluate whether
instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a
multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and
microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based
prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task
combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and
accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However,
trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced
reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study
highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized
medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical
workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe
findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning
patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a
promising step toward explainable and versatile medical AI. Code, model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测试时适应中，熵最小化因其高效性和适应性成为主流策略，但在持续测试时适应中，稳定性更为重要。作者发现熵最小化方法容易导致模型崩溃，即模型预测所有图像为单一类别，因此需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 论文提出了排名熵最小化方法，通过渐进掩码策略显式结构化预测难度，逐步对齐模型在不同预测难度下的概率分布，同时保持熵的排名顺序。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中进行了广泛评估，实证结果表明其有效性。

Conclusion: 排名熵最小化方法有效缓解了熵最小化的稳定性问题，并扩展了其在持续场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online
manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and
adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time
adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy
minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model
converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial
solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability
problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to
continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction
difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually
aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of
prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed
method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GoT-R1通过将复杂推理能力迁移至视觉生成领域，推动了图像生成技术的进步，并公开了代码和预训练模型以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic
images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify
multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective
handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content
and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement
learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building
upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to
autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined
templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,
we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs
to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective
supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses
semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench
benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial
relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in
image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning
capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we

Motivation: 传统视觉Transformer因全局自注意力机制导致计算复杂度高，且图像中关键信息分布不均，部分令牌对下游任务无益。

Method: 提出AnchorFormer，利用锚点令牌学习关键信息，通过二分注意力降低复杂度，并通过马尔可夫过程近似全局自注意力。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中准确率提升9.0%或计算量减少46.7%，在COCO检测任务中mAP提升81.3%。

Conclusion: AnchorFormer有效降低了计算成本并提升了性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions
and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we
extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification,
detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of
our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs
reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under
comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Conclusion: CodeMerge在保证适应质量的同时显著降低了计算开销，为动态环境下的3D感知提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time
conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems.
Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks
like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While
recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer
improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are
computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple
forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and
scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating
in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents
each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source
model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute
merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints,
enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality.
Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving
end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by
over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as
online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and

*Vignesh Gopinathan,Urs Zimmermann,Michael Arnold,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LiDAR的自动视频字幕生成方法，通过规则系统和模板字幕提升视频字幕模型对时间动态的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频字幕模型在时间语义捕捉和利用方面存在不足，尤其是在高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）中。论文旨在填补这一空白，提升模型对交通参与者时间动态的理解。

Method: 采用基于LiDAR的规则系统提取车道位置和相对运动等关键信息，结合模板生成字幕，并使用这些字幕监督训练SwinBERT模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个数据集上均能显著提升模型对时间动态的理解，有效减少现有模型中的视觉/静态偏差。

Conclusion: 基于LiDAR的字幕监督能显著增强视频字幕模型的时间理解能力，为解决当前模型架构中的视觉/静态偏差提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years,
especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While
many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as
temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how
models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature
extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We
propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the
temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based
system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion
from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our
findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only
front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions,
specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to
improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In
conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based
caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively
addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current
state-of-the-art model architectures.

### [467] [Semantic Compression of 3D Objects for Open and Collaborative Virtual Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16679)
*Jordan Dotzel,Tony Montes,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Zhiru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义的3D对象压缩方法，通过忽略结构信息并利用自然语言作为存储格式，实现了高达105倍的压缩率，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D对象压缩方法在处理高压缩率时会出现纹理伪影、多边形数量不足和网格间隙等问题，而语义压缩方法通过直接操作核心概念，能够实现更高的压缩率并保持质量。

Method: 论文构建了一个基于公共生成模型的3D语义压缩流程，利用自然语言作为存储格式，并通过先进的深度生成模型预测缺失信息。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上的实验表明，语义压缩可以实现高达105倍的压缩率，并在100倍压缩率附近的质量保持区域优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义压缩方法在高压缩率场景下表现优异，尤其适合增强现实和虚拟现实中的大规模协作项目。

Abstract: Traditional methods for 3D object compression operate only on structural
information within the object vertices, polygons, and textures. These methods
are effective at compression rates up to 10x for standard object sizes but
quickly deteriorate at higher compression rates with texture artifacts,
low-polygon counts, and mesh gaps. In contrast, semantic compression ignores
structural information and operates directly on the core concepts to push to
extreme levels of compression. In addition, it uses natural language as its
storage format, which makes it natively human-readable and a natural fit for
emerging applications built around large-scale, collaborative projects within
augmented and virtual reality. It deprioritizes structural information like
location, size, and orientation and predicts the missing information with
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In this work, we construct a pipeline
for 3D semantic compression from public generative models and explore the
quality-compression frontier for 3D object compression. We apply this pipeline
to achieve rates as high as 105x for 3D objects taken from the Objaverse
dataset and show that semantic compression can outperform traditional methods
in the important quality-preserving region around 100x compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出FarSight解码策略，通过因果掩码优化减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，提升视觉问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中表现优异，但常出现幻觉问题，分为初始幻觉和雪球幻觉两类。作者认为通过增强多模态令牌间的信息交互可以减少对异常令牌的依赖。

Method: 提出FarSight解码策略，利用因果掩码优化信息传播，设计注意力寄存器结构和位置感知编码方法，动态分配注意力并减少异常令牌干扰。

Result: FarSight在图像和视频基准测试中显著减少了多种MLLM的幻觉问题，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: FarSight作为一种即插即用的解码策略，通过优化因果掩码和信息传播，有效缓解了多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they
often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized
into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We
argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the
token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding
strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information
propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient
interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens,
overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene
in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context
inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play
decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely
by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token
propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper
triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to
capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness
encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model
to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks.
With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant
hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and
video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

*Alya Zouzou,Léo andéol,Mélanie Ducoffe,Ryma Boumazouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用共形预测提升基于视觉的着陆系统中跑道检测的可靠性，通过量化统计不确定性并提出新指标C-mAP，为航空航天领域机器学习系统认证铺路。

Abstract: We explore the use of conformal prediction to provide statistical uncertainty
guarantees for runway detection in vision-based landing systems (VLS). Using
fine-tuned YOLOv5 and YOLOv6 models on aerial imagery, we apply conformal
prediction to quantify localization reliability under user-defined risk levels.
We also introduce Conformal mean Average Precision (C-mAP), a novel metric
aligning object detection performance with conformal guarantees. Our results
show that conformal prediction can improve the reliability of runway detection
by quantifying uncertainty in a statistically sound way, increasing safety
on-board and paving the way for certification of ML system in the aerospace
domain.

### [470] [T2I-ConBench: Text-to-Image Benchmark for Continual Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16875)
*Zhehao Huang,Yuhang Liu,Yixin Lou,Zhengbao He,Mingzhen He,Wenxing Zhou,Tao Li,Kehan Li,Zeyi Huang,Xiaolin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了T2I-ConBench基准，用于评估文本到图像模型的持续后训练性能，发现现有方法在多个维度上存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的持续后训练缺乏标准化评估协议，导致研究进展受限。

Method: 引入T2I-ConBench基准，结合自动化指标、人类偏好建模和视觉语言问答，评估四种维度。

Result: 测试了十种代表性方法，发现没有方法在所有方面表现优异，跨任务泛化问题仍未解决。

Conclusion: 发布了所有数据集、代码和评估工具，以加速文本到图像模型持续后训练的研究。

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to
learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive
post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines
zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized
evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To
address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual
post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical
scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four
dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3)
catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines
automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for
comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three
realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even
joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task
generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation
tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image
models.

*Iván Matas,Carmen Serrano,Miguel Nogales,David Moreno,Lara Ferrándiz,Teresa Ojeda,Begoña Acha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种无监督学习框架，用于提取皮肤科图像的高价值特征，与基于ImageNet的预训练模型相比，展示了更好的泛化能力和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在计算机视觉中依赖大量标注数据和计算资源，而基于自然图像数据集（如ImageNet）预训练的模型可能无法捕捉医学影像的领域特定特征。

Method: 研究使用变分自编码器（VAE）在专有皮肤科数据集上从头训练，学习结构化和临床相关的潜在空间，并与ImageNet预训练模型在相同分类条件下进行比较。

Result: 自监督模型的最终验证损失为0.110（降低33.33%），而ImageNet预训练模型停滞在0.100（降低16.67%），显示过拟合。自监督模型准确率从45%提升至65%（+44.44%），过拟合差距接近零；ImageNet预训练模型达到87%（+50.00%）但最终稳定在75%（+19.05%），过拟合差距增至+0.060。

Conclusion: ImageNet预训练虽加速收敛，但会放大非临床相关特征的过拟合；自监督学习则实现稳定改进、更强泛化和更优适应性，凸显医学影像中领域特定特征提取的重要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision but relies heavily on large
labeled datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning, particularly
fine-tuning pretrained models, offers a practical alternative; however, models
pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet may fail to capture
domain-specific characteristics in medical imaging. This study introduces an
unsupervised learning framework that extracts high-value dermatological
features instead of relying solely on ImageNet-based pretraining. We employ a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained from scratch on a proprietary
dermatological dataset, allowing the model to learn a structured and clinically
relevant latent space. This self-supervised feature extractor is then compared
to an ImageNet-pretrained backbone under identical classification conditions,
highlighting the trade-offs between general-purpose and domain-specific
pretraining. Our results reveal distinct learning patterns. The self-supervised
model achieves a final validation loss of 0.110 (-33.33%), while the
ImageNet-pretrained model stagnates at 0.100 (-16.67%), indicating overfitting.
Accuracy trends confirm this: the self-supervised model improves from 45% to
65% (+44.44%) with a near-zero overfitting gap, whereas the ImageNet-pretrained
model reaches 87% (+50.00%) but plateaus at 75% (+19.05%), with its overfitting
gap increasing to +0.060. These findings suggest that while ImageNet
pretraining accelerates convergence, it also amplifies overfitting on
non-clinically relevant features. In contrast, self-supervised learning
achieves steady improvements, stronger generalization, and superior
adaptability, underscoring the importance of domain-specific feature extraction
in medical imaging.

### [472] [REPA Works Until It Doesn't: Early-Stopped, Holistic Alignment Supercharges Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16792)
*Ziqiao Wang,Wangbo Zhao,Yuhao Zhou,Zekai Li,Zhiyuan Liang,Mingjia Shi,Xuanlei Zhao,Pengfei Zhou,Kaipeng Zhang,Zhangyang Wang,Kai Wang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HASTE提出了一种两阶段训练方法，通过早期对齐教师模型特征和注意力模式加速扩散变换器（DiTs）训练，后期终止对齐以释放生成能力，显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法REPA虽能加速DiTs早期训练，但因教师模型低维嵌入限制学生模型后期生成能力。本文旨在解决这一容量不匹配问题。

Method: HASTE分为两阶段：1）综合对齐教师模型的注意力图和特征投影；2）达到触发条件后一次性终止对齐，专注去噪任务。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，HASTE仅用50轮达到基线性能，500轮匹配REPA最佳结果，训练步骤减少28倍。MS-COCO文本生成任务同样有效。

Conclusion: HASTE通过动态调整对齐策略，实现了DiTs高效训练，且无需修改模型架构，具有跨任务普适性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet
their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation
alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative
teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus
or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity
mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data
distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns
become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic
Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase
schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a
holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational
priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into
mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs
one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger
such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and
exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs
without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla
SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,
amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves
text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled
recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/HASTE .

*Karlis Martins Briedis,Markus Gross,Christopher Schroers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种更高效的全对相关体积采样实现方法，显著降低内存使用和计算复杂度，同时保持高分辨率下的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前光流估计方法通常使用密集全对相关体积的局部成本采样，导致计算和内存复杂度呈二次方增长。现有内存高效实现方法速度较慢，通常需降低图像分辨率处理，丢失细节信息。

Method: 提出了一种更高效的全对相关体积采样实现方法，与RAFT定义的精确数学运算符匹配，同时保持低内存使用。

Result: 该方法比按需采样快90%，内存使用降低95%，整体模型推理时间节省50%，在8K超高分辨率数据集上取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存受限环境下实现了高效、高精度的光流估计，适用于高分辨率场景。

Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from
a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational
and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative
memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is
slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at
reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs
correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as
defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while
maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default
implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a
significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50%
savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained
environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K
ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of
the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at
high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态虚假信息快速传播，但现有研究因缺乏大规模多样化数据集和深度推理能力而受限。

Method: 构建FakeVV数据集（10万+视频-文本对），提出Fact-R1框架：1) 长链思维指令微调 2) DPO偏好对齐 3) GRPO策略优化。

Result: Fact-R1在复杂多模态场景中展现出与先进文本强化学习系统相当的推理能力，建立了可解释的虚假信息检测新范式。

Conclusion: 该研究通过融合大规模视频理解、推理引导对齐和可解释验证，为虚假信息检测领域提供了新基准和方法框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised
growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains
limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods
often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive
content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale
benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained,
interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel
framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based
reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1)
misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference
alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This
enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those
observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more
complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm
for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding,
reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Feature Mixing的简单快速方法，用于多模态异常合成，以改进OOD检测和分割，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界应用（如自动驾驶和机器人辅助手术）本质上是多模态的，而现有研究主要关注单模态图像数据，缺乏对未知数据的监督信号，导致对OOD样本的预测过于自信。

Method: 提出Feature Mixing方法，这是一种理论支持的多模态异常合成方法，适用于各种模态组合，且无需特定模态知识。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes、CARLA-OOD数据集和MultiOOD基准测试中，Feature Mixing实现了最先进的性能，速度提升了10到370倍。

Conclusion: Feature Mixing是一种高效且通用的方法，能够显著提升多模态OOD检测和分割的性能，适用于多种现实场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for
deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has
primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are
inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for
improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from
unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address
this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method
for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further
optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various
modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal
dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse
scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI,
nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that
Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370
\times$ speedup. Our source code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于内容感知空间分组的视觉Transformer架构，无需额外分割头即可实现原生分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉主干网络采用均匀下采样降低空间分辨率，但缺乏对图像边界和语义内容的动态适应能力。

Method: 通过堆叠内容感知的空间分组层，动态将token分配到基于图像边界和语义内容的集合中，形成层次化分割。

Result: 该架构仅通过分组层即可产生强分割掩码，支持零样本分割任务，并实现高效的下游分割模型设计。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的原生分割范式，为无监督分割和高效模型设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial
resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design
built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns
tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content.
Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in
hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction
process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We
show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong
segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional
segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of
native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results
without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model
design for downstream segmentation tasks. Our project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在简短描述下表现优异，但在处理专业应用中所需的长篇、细节密集提示时性能显著下降，缺乏专门的评估基准。

Method: 提出DetailMaster基准，包含四个评估维度：角色属性、结构化角色位置、多维场景属性和显式空间/交互关系，使用平均284.89个token的长提示进行评估。

Result: 评估了7个通用和5个长提示优化的模型，发现最先进模型在关键维度上仅达到约50%的准确率，且随着提示长度增加性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型在结构理解和细节处理上的系统性缺陷，推动未来研究开发具有更强组合推理能力的架构，并开源了数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in
synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly
degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in
professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities
to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional
requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions:
Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene
Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark
comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high
quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5
long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations:
state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like
attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive
performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights
systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling,
motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional
reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools
to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would
otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Conclusion: 通过精确对齐嵌入空间和增强门控融合，本文方法有效提升了人脸与声音关联的准确性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We study the task of learning association between faces and voices, which is
gaining interest in the multimodal community lately. These methods suffer from
the deliberate crafting of negative mining procedures as well as the reliance
on the distant margin parameter. These issues are addressed by learning a joint
embedding space in which orthogonality constraints are applied to the fused
embeddings of faces and voices. However, embedding spaces of faces and voices
possess different characteristics and require spaces to be aligned before
fusing them. To this end, we propose a method that accurately aligns the
embedding spaces and fuses them with an enhanced gated fusion thereby improving
the performance of face-voice association. Extensive experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset reveals the merits of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive success in
question-answering tasks, yet their capabilities for spatial understanding are
less explored. This work investigates a critical question: do existing MLLMs
possess 3D spatial perception and understanding abilities? Concretely, we make
the following contributions in this paper: (i) we introduce VGBench, a
benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs for visual geometry perception,
e.g., camera pose and motion estimation; (ii) we propose SpatialScore, the most
comprehensive and diverse multimodal spatial understanding benchmark to date,
integrating VGBench with relevant data from the other 11 existing datasets.
This benchmark comprises 28K samples across various spatial understanding
tasks, modalities, and QA formats, along with a carefully curated challenging
subset, SpatialScore-Hard; (iii) we develop SpatialAgent, a novel multi-agent
system incorporating 9 specialized tools for spatial understanding, supporting
both Plan-Execute and ReAct reasoning paradigms; (iv) we conduct extensive
evaluations to reveal persistent challenges in spatial reasoning while
demonstrating the effectiveness of SpatialAgent. We believe SpatialScore will
offer valuable insights and serve as a rigorous benchmark for the next
evolution of MLLMs.

Result: 轻量级GPT-4o-mini模型在英文基准测试达到SOTA，中文测试显著提升，多选题表现媲美GPT-4o，开放式问题优于36.7%。

Conclusion: LAD为AI理解图像隐喻提供新思路，推动视觉-语言推理和人机交互领域发展，项目已开源。

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain
circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However,
the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously
reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly
understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines
sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that
encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that
noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using
change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which,
in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations
observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using
numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position
estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on
angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for
modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization
in noisy neural circuits.
