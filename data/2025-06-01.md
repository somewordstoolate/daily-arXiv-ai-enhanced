### [1] [Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704)
*Feng Yao,Zilong Wang,Liyuan Liu,Junxia Cui,Li Zhong,Xiaohan Fu,Haohui Mai,Vish Krishnan,Jianfeng Gao,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出REAL框架，通过强化学习结合程序分析和单元测试反馈，提升大语言模型生成代码的质量和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型生成的代码在安全性和可维护性上存在缺陷，现有方法依赖人工标注或启发式规则，难以扩展。

Method: REAL框架利用程序分析检测缺陷和单元测试验证功能，通过强化学习自动优化模型生成的代码。

Result: 实验表明，REAL在功能性和代码质量评估上优于现有方法，且无需人工干预。

Conclusion: REAL框架缩小了快速原型和生产级代码间的差距，使大语言模型能同时保证速度和质量。

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

### [2] [Climate Finance Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22752)
*Rafik Mankour,Yassine Chafai,Hamada Saleh,Ghassen Ben Hassine,Thibaud Barreau,Peter Tankov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Climate Finance Bench开放基准，用于评估大语言模型在企业气候披露问答中的表现，并通过RAG方法比较指出检索能力是关键瓶颈，同时倡导AI气候应用中的透明碳报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对企业气候披露信息缺乏标准化评估工具的问题，构建一个开放基准以促进大语言模型在该领域的应用优化。

Method: 收集11个GICS行业33份英文可持续发展报告，标注330组专家验证的QA对（涵盖提取/数值/逻辑推理），并基于此比较不同RAG方法。

Result: 发现检索模块定位答案段落的能力是主要性能瓶颈，量化权重等技术可提升碳报告透明度。

Conclusion: 强调检索优化对气候问答系统的重要性，并提倡在AI气候应用中采用透明碳计量方法。

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)
*Ansar Aynetdinov,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对小型语言模型的多令牌预测训练策略，通过课程学习逐步调整训练目标，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多令牌预测（MTP）在大模型中表现优异，但小型语言模型（SLMs）难以有效利用该目标。为此，研究旨在探索如何通过课程学习帮助SLMs更好地适应MTP训练。

Method: 提出两种课程学习变体：正向课程（从单令牌预测逐步过渡到多令牌预测）和反向课程（从多令牌预测过渡到单令牌预测）。

Result: 正向课程使SLMs在预训练中更好地利用MTP，提升下游任务性能和生成质量，同时保留自推测解码优势；反向课程虽提升性能但失去自推测解码优势。

Conclusion: 课程学习策略能有效帮助SLMs适应MTP训练，正向课程在性能与解码效率间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

### [4] [FAMA: The First Large-Scale Open-Science Speech Foundation Model for English and Italian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22759)
*Sara Papi,Marco Gaido,Luisa Bentivogli,Alessio Brutti,Mauro Cettolo,Roberto Gretter,Marco Matassoni,Mohamed Nabih,Matteo Negri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAMA是一系列开放科学的语音基础模型，针对英语和意大利语训练，性能接近现有模型且速度更快，所有资源开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音基础模型（如Whisper和SeamlessM4T）的封闭性（训练数据和代码不可获取）导致可复现性和公平评估的挑战。为促进语音技术的开放科学，作者开发了FAMA系列模型。

Method: 使用超过15万小时的开源语音数据训练FAMA模型，并提供了一个包含1.6万小时清理和伪标注语音的新数据集。

Result: FAMA在性能上与现有语音基础模型相当，且速度提升高达8倍。所有代码、数据集和模型均以开源许可证发布。

Conclusion: FAMA填补了语音领域开放科学的空白，为研究社区提供了透明、高效的语音基础模型和数据集。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

### [5] [StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22765)
*Iddo Yosha,Gallil Maimon,Yossi Adi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StressTest基准和Stress17k数据集，用于评估和提升语音感知语言模型在句子重音理解上的能力，并展示了微调后的StresSLM模型显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子重音在表达意义和说话者意图中起关键作用，但在语音感知语言模型的评估和开发中常被忽视。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入StressTest基准评估模型对重音模式的区分能力，提出合成数据生成流程创建Stress17k训练集，并用于微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在重音任务上表现不佳，而微调后的StresSLM在句子重音推理和检测任务上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据微调模型能有效提升其对句子重音的理解能力，StresSLM在相关任务上表现卓越。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

### [6] [Automated Essay Scoring Incorporating Annotations from Automated Feedback Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22771)
*Christopher Ormerod*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过整合反馈导向的注释（拼写/语法纠错和论证结构标注）到自动作文评分流程中，使用大语言模型提升评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用反馈性注释（如错误标记和论证要素标注）增强自动化作文评分系统的准确性，并以PERSUADE语料库为例验证其可行性。

Method: 结合生成式语言模型（拼写纠错）和编码器分类模型（论证要素识别），将两类注释融入基于编码器大语言模型的评分分类器。

Result: 实验表明，整合注释后的评分模型性能得到提升。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的注释能有效优化自动化作文评分，为实际应用提供可扩展方案。

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

### [7] [Counting trees: A treebank-driven exploration of syntactic variation in speech and writing across languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22774)
*Kaja Dobrovoljc*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于树库的依赖解析方法，对比分析了英语和斯洛文尼亚语口语与书面语的句法结构差异，发现口语的句法结构更少且多样性较低，两者重叠有限，反映了不同交际需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于系统比较口语和书面语的句法结构差异，以理解不同交际模态对句法组织的影响，并为语料库驱动的语法理论提供基础。

Method: 采用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的通用依存树库中提取去词汇化的依存子树，分析句法结构的数量、多样性、分布及其在两种模态中的重叠情况。

Result: 结果显示，口语语料库的句法结构数量和多样性均低于书面语，两者句法结构重叠有限，且口语特有结构多与互动性、语境依托和表达经济性相关。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的可扩展、语言无关的框架为系统研究语料库间的句法变异提供了通用方法，为基于使用的语法理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

### [8] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)
*John Mendonça,Alon Lavie,Isabel Trancoso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MEDAL框架，通过多智能体自动生成多语言对话评估基准，发现当前LLM在检测细微问题（如共情和推理）方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聊天机器人评估数据集多为静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，难以捕捉语言和文化差异，阻碍了LLM的进一步发展。

Method: 使用多智能体框架MEDAL，结合先进LLM生成多语言对话，并利用GPT-4.1进行多维度分析，最终构建人工标注的元评估基准。

Result: 发现LLM在跨语言表现上存在显著差异，且难以识别共情和推理等细微问题。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为开放域对话评估者仍有局限，需进一步提升对复杂语言现象的理解能力。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

### [9] [Can Large Language Models Match the Conclusions of Systematic Reviews?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22787)
*Christopher Polzak,Alejandro Lozano,Min Woo Sun,James Burgess,Yuhui Zhang,Kevin Wu,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）能否在获得相同研究资料的情况下，匹配临床专家撰写的系统评价结论，并通过MedEvidence基准测试了24个LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着科学文章的指数级增长，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化生成系统评价（SR）的兴趣日益增加。然而，LLMs在批判性评估证据和跨文档推理方面的能力尚不明确。

Method: 研究提出了MedEvidence基准，将100个系统评价的发现与基于的研究配对，并对24个LLMs进行了基准测试，包括推理和非推理模型、医学专业模型以及不同规模的模型（从7B到700B）。

Result: 研究发现，推理并不一定能提高性能，更大的模型也不一定带来更大的增益，而基于知识的微调会降低MedEvidence上的准确性。大多数模型表现出相似的行为：性能随着令牌长度的增加而下降，响应表现出过度自信，并且与人类专家相反，所有模型对低质量发现缺乏科学怀疑。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，尽管这些系统已经被临床医生使用，但在LLMs能够可靠地匹配专家进行的系统评价观察之前，还需要更多的工作。研究团队向更广泛的研究社区发布了代码库和基准，以进一步研究基于LLM的SR系统。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

### [10] [Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801)
*Qing Wang,Yuepei Li,Qiao Qiao,Kang Zhou,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出MixORE框架，解决开放关系抽取中已知与未知关系混合分布的问题，通过两阶段分类与聚类方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开放关系抽取方法假设未标注数据仅含新关系或已预分割已知/新实例，但现实中新关系随机分布，需更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出MixORE框架，结合关系分类和聚类的两阶段方法，联合学习已知和新关系。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MixORE在已知关系分类和新关系聚类任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了通用开放关系抽取的发展，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

### [11] [First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809)
*Andrew Zhu,Evan Osgood,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的'旁听代理'范式，通过监听人类对话而非直接交互来提供辅助，并以《龙与地下城》游戏为场景验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式LLM代理需直接与用户交互，本文探索通过旁听人类对话提供背景支持的替代范式，旨在更自然地融入人类社交场景。

Method: 使用多模态音频-语言大模型作为旁听代理，在《龙与地下城》游戏中辅助地下城主，通过人类评估检验有效性。

Result: 研究发现某些音频-语言大模型能利用隐含音频线索完成旁听任务，相关代码库已开源以促进后续研究。

Conclusion: 旁听代理范式具有实践潜力，大模型展现出通过环境音频理解场景的涌现能力，为LLM应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

### [12] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)
*Yingming Wang,Pepa Atanasova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SR-NLE框架，通过自批判和迭代优化提升大语言模型解释的忠实度，无需外部监督即可显著降低不忠实率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型生成的解释常无法真实反映模型推理过程，而模型自我优化解释忠实度的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 引入SR-NLE框架，通过自然语言自反馈和基于特征归因的新型反馈机制，指导模型迭代优化事后解释。

Result: 在三个数据集和四个先进模型上，最佳方法将平均不忠实率从54.81%降至36.02%，绝对降低18.79%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅需适当反馈引导，大语言模型即可自我优化解释忠实度，无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

*Alexander Gill,Abhilasha Ravichander,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大语言模型(LLM)生成评估基准的可行性，发现虽然成本低但生成的数据对LLM挑战性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM生成数据作为评估基准的有效性，特别是在需要特定推理能力的任务上。

Method: 通过两个案例研究，比较LLM生成的阅读理解数据集与人工众包数据集的质量和难度。

Result: LLM生成的数据集成本低且符合标注规范，但对LLM的挑战性低于人工创建的数据集。

Conclusion: 结论指出需审慎评估LLM生成基准数据的直接使用，因其可能降低评估的挑战性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

*Arthur S. Bianchessi,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了贝叶斯注意力机制（BAM），通过将位置编码建模为概率先验，统一现有方法并显著提升长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法缺乏理论清晰性，且依赖有限评估指标验证其外推能力。

Method: 提出贝叶斯注意力机制（BAM），将位置编码视为概率模型中的先验，并推导出广义高斯位置先验。

Result: BAM在训练上下文长度500倍的范围内实现精准信息检索，长上下文检索准确率超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: BAM为位置编码提供了理论框架，显著提升模型的长上下文泛化能力，且参数开销极小。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

*Pingjun Hong,Beiduo Chen,Siyao Peng,Marie-Catherine de Marneffe,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文针对自然语言推理（NLI）中标注者标签内部差异问题，提出LITEX分类法，并通过实验验证其在解释生成中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言推理（NLI）中存在标注者标签内部差异问题，即标注者虽然给出相同标签，但推理过程却不同。这一问题尚未得到充分研究，论文旨在系统理解并解决这一问题。

Method: 论文引入LITEX，一种基于语言学的分类法，用于对自由文本解释进行分类。作者在e-SNLI数据集的一个子集上应用该分类法，并验证其可靠性。

Result: 实验表明，基于LITEX生成的解释在语言学上更接近人类解释，优于仅基于标签或高亮内容的生成方法。

Conclusion: LITEX不仅能够捕捉标签内部差异，还能通过分类法指导的生成方法，有效缩小人类与模型解释之间的差距。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

*Iknoor Singh,Carolina Scarton,Kalina Bontcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为H3Prompt的分层三步骤提示方法，用于多语言新闻叙事分类，并在SemEval 2025任务中取得最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线新闻的激增和错误信息的传播，自动数据分析方法变得至关重要。叙事分类成为重要任务，因为它能帮助事实核查者和政策制定者等专业人士识别在线信息内容。

Method: 采用分层三步骤提示策略（H3Prompt），首先将新闻分类到两个领域之一（乌克兰-俄罗斯战争或气候变化），然后识别主要叙事，最后分配子叙事。

Result: 该方法在全球28个参赛团队中，在英语测试集上取得了第一名。

Conclusion: H3Prompt方法在多语言叙事分类任务中表现出色，为自动新闻分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

*Jirui Qi,Shan Chen,Zidi Xiong,Raquel Fernández,Danielle S. Bitterman,Arianna Bisazza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在英语任务表现优异，但多语言推理能力不足，影响实际应用。研究发现强制使用用户语言会降低准确性，但少量针对性训练可部分缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言环境下的推理能力，因为用户需要母语推理过程进行有效监督，而现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 方法包括在XReasoning基准上全面评估两类领先的LRMs，测试其多语言推理表现，并尝试通过提示干预和少量针对性训练（100个样本）改善效果。

Result: 结果显示先进模型常退回英语或产生碎片化推理；强制使用用户语言提升可读性但降低准确性；100样本的微调可缓解问题，但仍存在准确率损失。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，揭示了可读性与准确性的权衡，并表明小规模针对性训练是可行改进方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

*Chahat Raj,Bowen Wei,Aylin Caliskan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Ziwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VIGNETTE基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方面的偏见，揭示了VLMs如何通过视觉线索构建社会意义并编码社会等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的偏见已被广泛研究，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见问题却较少受到关注。现有研究多集中于肖像类图像和性别-职业关联，忽略了更广泛和复杂的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害。

Method: 通过构建一个包含3000万+图像的大规模VQA基准VIGNETTE，采用问答框架评估VLMs在四个方向（事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策）的偏见，并结合社会心理学分析VLMs如何从视觉线索推断特质和角色。

Result: 研究发现VLMs在解释身份时表现出微妙、多面且令人惊讶的刻板印象模式，揭示了模型如何通过偏见选择编码社会等级和构建社会意义。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs如何从输入中构建社会意义提供了新见解，强调了评估和解决VLMs中广泛社会偏见的必要性。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在归因事件结果时如何隐含偏见，影响公平性。

Method: 提出基于认知的偏见评估框架，分析模型推理差异如何导向人口统计学偏见。

Result: 揭示了LLMs在归因时存在的人口统计学偏见，影响决策公平。

Conclusion: 认知框架有效识别LLMs的偏见，为公平性改进提供方向。

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学问答评估依赖昂贵的人工标注，且缺乏对临床推理和工作流程的全面评估，尤其在急诊室这种高风险、快节奏环境中。

Method: 构建ER-Reason基准，包含3,984名患者的25,174份纵向临床记录，覆盖急诊工作流关键阶段，并收集72份医生撰写的推理过程。

Result: 评估显示，当前最先进的大语言模型在急诊决策中的临床推理与医生水平存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以缩小大语言模型与医生临床推理的差距，提升其在急诊等高风险场景的应用能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长期上下文时存在语义信息保留和检索的局限性，导致上下文丢失和语义漂移问题。

Method: 模型整合了显式记忆单元、门控写入机制、注意力读取模块和遗忘功能，并设计了联合训练目标，结合主任务损失与记忆写入/遗忘约束。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在文本生成一致性、多轮问答稳定性和跨上下文推理准确性上具有优势，有效缓解了传统模型处理长期依赖时的缺陷。

Conclusion: 记忆机制在语言理解中起关键作用，所提出的方法在架构设计和性能表现上均具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在处理使用LoRA微调的模型时，常因参数与数据分布的相互作用导致性能显著下降，亟需一种能保持单任务精度并提升合并鲁棒性的解决方案。

Method: 提出OSRM（正交子空间鲁棒模型合并）方法，在微调前约束LoRA子空间，确保任务相关更新不会对其他任务产生负面影响，并可兼容现有合并算法。

Result: 在8个数据集、3种常用LM和2种大LM上的实验表明，OSRM显著提升合并性能，保持单任务精度，且对合并超参数更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数据-参数交互在模型合并中的重要性，OSRM为LoRA模型合并提供了即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: This study presents an efficient transformer-based question-answering (QA)
model optimized for deployment on a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U CPU, using the
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1. Leveraging exploratory data
analysis, data augmentation, and fine-tuning of a DistilBERT architecture, the
model achieves a validation F1 score of 0.6536 with an average inference time
of 0.1208 seconds per question. Compared to a rule-based baseline (F1: 0.3124)
and full BERT-based models, our approach offers a favorable trade-off between
accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it well-suited for real-time
applications on resource-constrained systems. The study includes systematic
evaluation of data augmentation strategies and hyperparameter configurations,
providing practical insights into optimizing transformer models for CPU-based
inference.

Result: 在WorkArena基准测试中，WorkForceAgent-R1比SFT基线性能提升10.26-16.59%，与专有LLM代理（如GPT-4o）性能相当。

Conclusion: WorkForceAgent-R1通过强化学习有效提升了业务场景下网络导航任务的推理和规划能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Conclusion: MAC基准和自训练方法为多模态表示的组合鲁棒性评估提供了新工具，同时揭示了当前模型的潜在改进方向。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs在非英语语言中的记忆能力，以及这种能力是否能在不同语言间迁移，尤其是对于低资源语言。

Method: 研究方法包括构建OWL数据集（包含10种语言的31.5K对齐文本），并通过三种任务（直接探测、名称填空和前缀探测）评估模型的记忆能力。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs在不同语言间均能回忆内容，例如GPT-4o在新翻译文本中识别作者和标题的准确率为69%，预测掩码实体的准确率为6%。扰动（如打乱单词）对官方翻译文本的直接探测准确率影响较小（下降7%）。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了LLMs跨语言记忆的广泛性，并揭示了不同模型之间的差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在高风险应用中的部署，评估其理解否定句的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 通过利用大型语言模型从现有VQA数据集中生成否定问题，构建了包含7,379个二选一问题的NegVQA基准。

Result: 评估了20个先进视觉语言模型，发现它们在否定句理解上表现显著下降，并揭示了一个U型缩放趋势。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了视觉语言模型在否定理解上的关键差距，为未来模型发展提供了见解。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在零样本摘要中表现优异，但在长文本中建模文档结构和识别关键信息方面存在困难。

Method: 提出StrucSum框架，采用三种策略：邻居感知提示（NAP）、中心性感知提示（CAP）和中心性引导掩码（CGM）。

Result: 在ArXiv、PubMed和Multi-News数据集上，StrucSum显著提升摘要质量和事实一致性，尤其在ArXiv上FactCC和SummaC分别提升19.2和9.7分。

Conclusion: 结构感知提示是一种简单有效的零样本抽取式摘要方法，无需训练或任务特定调优。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Result: 结果显示，大规模和微调模型整体表现强劲，但存在高环境成本；同时模型在长文本、微妙表述和情感化语言处理上存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: 结论强调了大语言模型在在线评论自动论点分析中的潜力与当前局限，对内容审核等下游应用提出了警示。

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出HSE-Bench基准数据集，评估大语言模型在HSE合规评估中的能力，发现其依赖语义匹配而非原则推理，并提出新的提示技术RoE以改进推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSE合规评估需要复杂法规和人机环境交互下的实时决策，而大语言模型在该领域的专业知识和结构化法律推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含1000多个问题的HSE-Bench数据集，采用IRAC推理流程评估模型，并提出RoE提示技术模拟专家推理。

Result: 当前大语言模型表现良好但依赖语义匹配，缺乏系统法律推理能力；RoE技术能提升决策准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在HSE合规推理中的不足，RoE技术为相关任务提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ToMAP方法，通过增强LLM的心理理论推理能力来提升说服效果，实验显示其性能优于GPT-4等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在心理理论推理上存在不足，导致说服过程中缺乏多样性和对手意识，无法像人类一样主动动态建模对方观点。

Method: 引入ToMAP框架，包含两个心理理论模块：先预测对方对核心主张的潜在反对意见，再用强化学习训练说服者分析对手信息并生成更有效论据。

Result: 仅含30亿参数的ToMAP在多个测试场景中相对GPT-4o实现39.4%的性能提升，能生成更多样、逻辑性更强的论据，并适用于长对话。

Conclusion: ToMAP通过增强对手意识显著提升了LLM的说服能力，为开发更具说服力的语言智能体提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

*Sheng Zhang,Qin Liu,Naoto Usuyama,Cliff Wong,Tristan Naumann,Hoifung Poon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次探索了电子健康记录（EHR）基础模型的扩展规律，发现其与大型语言模型（LLM）类似，可通过模型规模、数据量和计算资源的系统增加实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩展规律在大型语言模型中已被广泛研究，但在电子健康记录（EHR）领域仍未被探索。EHR数据具有丰富的时序性和结构性差异，研究其扩展规律有助于优化资源分配并推动个性化医疗发展。

Method: 研究使用MIMIC-IV数据库中的患者时间线数据，通过变换不同模型规模和计算预算训练Transformer架构，分析扩展行为。

Result: 研究发现EHR模型表现出与LLM类似的扩展规律，包括抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线和计算、模型参数、数据量与临床效用之间的幂律关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发高效的EHR基础模型奠定了基础，有望推动临床预测任务和个性化医疗的进步。

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VeGraph框架，利用LLM代理解决复杂声明验证中的实体消歧问题，通过图表示、实体消歧和验证三阶段提升验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法在处理复杂语义结构或模糊实体时缺乏有效消歧策略，影响验证准确性。大语言模型时代下，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: VeGraph框架分三阶段：1) 将声明分解为结构化三元组构建图表示；2) 迭代交互知识库消歧实体；3) 验证剩余三元组完成事实核查。

Result: 基于Meta-Llama-3-70B的实验表明，VeGraph在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准上性能优于基线，有效解决声明验证挑战。

Conclusion: VeGraph通过图结构与LLM推理能力结合，为复杂声明验证提供了可解释、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

TL;DR: DyePack框架通过后门攻击检测语言模型是否在训练中使用了基准测试集，无需访问模型内部细节，有效识别污染模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放基准测试集对评估和推进大语言模型至关重要，但其易获取性可能导致测试集污染。本文旨在解决如何在不依赖模型内部信息的情况下，准确检测模型是否在训练中使用了测试集数据。

Method: 提出DyePack框架，通过向测试数据中混入带有随机目标的后门样本，利用多后门设计和随机目标实现精确的假阳性率计算，从而可靠地标记污染模型。

Result: 在多项选择题任务中，DyePack成功检测出所有污染模型，假阳性率极低（MMLU-Pro为0.000073%，Big-Bench-Hard为0.000017%）。在开放式生成任务中，假阳性率为0.127%，同样有效识别所有污染模型。

Conclusion: DyePack提供了一种无需模型内部信息的可靠方法，能够准确检测语言模型是否在训练中使用了测试集数据，有效防止误判并确保检测的可信度。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于参考过滤和TF-IDF聚类的隐蔽后门样本检测方法（RFTC），有效识别并清除大语言模型中的恶意样本，提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门检测方法在生成任务中效果有限，或可能影响生成性能。隐蔽后门样本对下游应用构成安全威胁，亟需高效清除方法。

Method: RFTC方法：1) 通过参考模型输出对比筛选可疑样本；2) 对可疑样本进行TF-IDF聚类，利用类内距离差异识别真实后门样本。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集和一个QA数据集上的实验表明，RFTC在后门检测和模型性能上均优于基线方法。参考过滤机制有效性得到验证。

Conclusion: RFTC通过结合参考过滤和聚类分析，为LLMs中的隐蔽后门检测提供了高效解决方案，且不影响正常生成性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CHED基准和CoRE方法，用于评估和改进知识编辑方法在上下文环境中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的知识编辑评估通常忽略前置上下文的影响，而实际应用中这些上下文可能触发原始知识，削弱编辑效果。

Method: 开发了CHED基准评估上下文鲁棒性，并提出了CoRE方法，通过最小化隐藏状态的上下文敏感方差来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 评估显示现有方法在前置上下文存在时经常失败，而CoRE方法提高了编辑成功率并保持了模型整体能力。

Conclusion: CoRE方法有效提升了知识编辑在上下文环境中的鲁棒性，同时分析了不同上下文形式对编辑效果的影响。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索仅通过文本数据（如图像-标题数据集中的文本）是否能准确估计词汇的图像化（imageability）和具体性（concreteness）这两种心理语言学特性。

Method: 方法上，作者假设语义嵌入空间中词汇邻域的峰值锐度反映了其图像化和具体性程度，并提出了一种无监督、无分布的度量NSM来量化这种锐度。

Result: 实验结果表明，NSM与真实评分的相关性优于现有无监督方法，且在分类任务中能有效预测这两种特性。

Conclusion: 结论是文本数据本身足以准确估计词汇的图像化和具体性，NSM是一种有效的无监督预测方法。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub
(https://github.com/Artificial-Memory-Lab/imageability).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通用临床NLP工具广泛用于临床报告自动标注，但针对特定任务（如儿科胸部X光报告标注）的独立评估有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究评估了四种商业NLP系统（AWS、GC、AZ、SP）和两种专用工具（CheXpert、CheXbert）在95,008份儿科胸部X光报告中的实体提取和断言检测能力，使用Fleiss Kappa和准确率进行对比。

Result: 不同系统提取的实体数量差异显著（SP最多，GC最少），断言准确率平均62%（SP最高76%，AWS最低50%）。专用工具准确率为56%，性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 临床NLP工具性能存在较大变异性，部署前需严格验证和人工审核以确保可靠性。

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要在对话界面设计中平衡效率与丰富性，并关注多语言用户的教学问题，同时指出未来需进行更全面的方法论阐述和实证验证。

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出EL4NER方法，通过集成多个小参数开源LLM的ICL输出来提升NER任务性能，降低部署和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于ICL的NER方法依赖大参数LLM，存在计算资源消耗大、API成本高、数据隐私问题及社区协作障碍等问题。

Method: EL4NER包含三个关键组件：基于任务分解的流水线、面向NER的span级句子相似度算法及自验证机制。

Result: 实验表明EL4NER以更低参数量超越多数闭源大模型方法，部分数据集上达到ICL-based SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EL4NER证明了在ICL范式下使用开源小参数LLM进行NER任务的可行性及参数效率优势。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on

TL;DR: RAGRouter通过动态结合检索文档与对比学习，优化了多LLM在RAG场景下的路由选择，显著提升性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法依赖静态知识表示，在RAG场景下表现不佳，需结合动态检索文档影响以提升路由效果。

Method: 提出RAGRouter，利用文档嵌入和RAG能力嵌入，通过对比学习捕捉知识表示变化，实现智能路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，RAGRouter平均优于最佳单LLM 3.61%，优于现有路由方法3.29%-9.33%，并在低延迟下保持高效。

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态路由机制有效解决了RAG场景下的LLM选择问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

TL;DR: 小模型在代码生成的自修正能力不足，CoCoS方法通过强化学习提升其多轮修正能力，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小模型是否具备通过自我反思有效修正代码生成的能力，发现现有小模型在此方面表现不佳，因此提出改进方法。

Method: 提出CoCoS方法，采用在线强化学习目标，通过累积奖励函数和细粒度奖励机制，训练模型在多轮修正中保持正确输出并逐步修正错误。

Result: 使用1B规模模型，CoCoS在MBPP和HumanEval基准上分别比基线提高了35.8%和27.7%。

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升了小模型在代码生成中的自修正能力，为小模型在多轮修正任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

Method: 构建包含图像和文本的SNS-Bench-VL基准，涵盖8类多模态任务（如笔记理解、用户参与分析等），包含4001个多模态问答对，采用单选、多选和开放式题型。

Result: 测试了25个先进多模态大模型，发现它们在多模态社交上下文理解方面仍存在持续挑战。

Conclusion: SNS-Bench-VL基准将推动下一代社交网络服务中鲁棒、情境感知且人类对齐的多模态智能研究。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social
Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content
understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in
modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a
comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of
Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务因需理解长上下文而比句子级任务更具挑战性。现有MBR解码的效用函数多针对句子设计，限制了其在文档级任务的表现。

Method: 提出MBR-OT方法，利用Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数计算文档效用，改进标准MBR解码。

Result: 实验表明，MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR方法。

Conclusion: MBR-OT通过优化效用计算方式，有效提升了文档级文本生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过提升LLM生成的关系抽取训练样本的多样性来改善零样本或少样本NLP任务效果，同时保证样本正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLM生成的关系抽取训练样本存在结构相似度高、表达单一的问题，影响了训练数据的质量。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 在ICL提示中直接加入多样性指令；2) 通过DPO对LLM进行微调以生成多样化样本。

Result: 实验表明两种方法均能提升生成数据质量，且用生成样本训练的非LLM模型性能优于直接使用LLM进行关系抽取。

Conclusion: 通过提升生成样本多样性可有效改善关系抽取任务表现，微调LLM的方法具有潜力。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

Motivation: 人类偏好数据在将大语言模型（LLM）与人类价值观对齐中至关重要，但收集此类数据成本高且效率低，存在可扩展性挑战。

Method: 使用GPT-4o作为LLM对齐的代理，计算现有偏好数据集中LLM生成响应的对齐分数，并基于均值和方差构建Alignment Data Map。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用33%的高均值、低方差区域数据，性能即可达到或超越全数据集，并能有效检测低影响或错误标注样本。

Conclusion: Alignment Data Map能显著提升数据收集效率，无需显式标注即可识别高质量样本，并可诊断现有偏好数据集。

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型在数学和科学领域表现优异，但在医疗领域应用不足，需开发针对性方法提升临床决策能力。

Method: 分两阶段训练：第一阶段用2000个文本样本微调模型以激发推理行为；第二阶段用1500个多模态医疗案例增强推理能力。

Result: MedE²在多模态医疗基准测试中持续超越基线，大模型和推理扩展实验进一步验证了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: MedE²有效提升了医疗多模态模型的推理性能，为临床决策支持提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

Result: ContextQFormer在TMDialog上比基线模型可用率提升2%-4%，数据集支持多轮多模态对话研究。

Conclusion: ContextQFormer和TMDialog有效解决了多模态模型的长上下文交互问题，为后续研究提供基础。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Method: 开发了一个全自动流程，动态生成可控难度的基准测试集，以解决现有推理基准的可扩展性和污染问题。

Result: 生成的测试集包含近1k个实例，现有最佳模型Claude-3.7-Sonnet的通过率仅为54%，表明大语言模型在历史语言学等领域的推理能力仍有不足。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管大语言模型在传统领域表现出色，但在历史语言学等领域的推理任务中仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言NLP任务中表现优异，但在处理上下文敏感单元（如多义词）时仍存在挑战，影响翻译准确性和理解能力。

Method: 动态分析并识别翻译难点，以结构化方式将其融入大语言模型，避免信息扁平化导致的误译或误解，高效激活模型相关知识。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，能以最小资源消耗提升大语言模型在多项NLP任务中的性能，尤其在处理上下文敏感单元时效果显著。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Motivation: 传统双语词典归纳（BLI）方法在专业领域（如医学）表现较差，主要因为专业领域数据规模小、词汇频率低，且静态词嵌入难以捕捉上下文相关语义。

Method: 结合预训练模型能力改进词嵌入，首次在跨领域BLI任务中引入代码切换（Code Switch）策略，使模型能适配不同上下文场景。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个特定领域上平均性能提升0.78分，优于传统BLI基线（如Muse和Vecmap）。

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升专业领域双语词典生成质量，但需进一步验证其在其他专业领域的适用性。

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on
three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

TL;DR: 提出Retell方法，利用生成语言模型将文学文本转化为高层次概念后应用LDA，比传统方法更能捕捉文学主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词袋方法（如LDA）难以处理文学文本，因其注重感官细节而非抽象描述。需要一种更适合文学的主题建模方法。

Method: 使用生成语言模型将文学段落转化为概念性描述，再对其应用LDA，而非直接使用原始文本或让模型列举主题。

Result: 在高中英语教材的种族/文化身份案例中，该方法比纯LDA或直接询问模型生成的主题更精确，与专家标注结果更吻合。

Conclusion: Retell方法通过'转述-建模'两阶段流程，为文学主题分析提供了更有效的解决方案，适用于文化分析场景。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high
school English language arts books.

curated IPAPack++, a large-scale multilingual speech corpus with 17,132 hours
of normalized phone transcriptions and a novel evaluation set capturing unseen
languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data,
ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用语言模型可解释性和不确定性量化来高效识别翻译错误的方法，通过多组人工标注评估了14种指标在12种翻译方向上的表现，揭示了无监督指标的潜力及监督方法在标签不确定性下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词级质量评估（WQE）技术成本高昂，依赖大型语言模型或大量人工标注数据。本研究旨在探索更高效的替代方案，利用翻译模型内部机制识别错误。

Method: 结合语言模型可解释性和不确定性量化技术，通过分析翻译模型的内部工作机理来识别错误，并使用多组人工标注数据评估14种指标。

Result: 研究发现无监督指标具有未开发的潜力，监督方法在标签不确定性下表现不佳，且单一标注者评估实践存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了无监督指标的潜力，指出了监督方法在标签不确定性下的不足，并呼吁改进评估实践以减少对单一标注者的依赖。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Result: 实验表明，MAEL能有效利用历史经验，实现更快收敛并生成更高质量的解决方案。

Conclusion: MAEL框架通过经验积累和跨任务学习，显著提升了多智能体系统的协作效能。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量人工或时间成本来为大语言模型收集任务解决经验，面对用户查询中日益多样化的任务类型，这种方法显得不切实际。

Method: 设计了一个自主经验转移框架，探索大语言模型是否能模仿人类认知智能，自动从源任务中迁移经验到目标任务。

Result: 在13个数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架有效提升了大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 自主经验转移框架不仅降低了经验获取的成本，还为提升大语言模型的泛化能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出MMBoundary框架，通过校准多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）推理步骤的置信度，减少幻觉传播，提升多模态推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在推理过程中存在幻觉传播问题，现有方法仅关注整体响应的置信度评估，而忽略了推理步骤的置信度校准。

Method: 提出MMBoundary框架，结合文本和跨模态自奖励信号评估每一步推理的置信度，并通过监督微调和强化学习阶段校准置信度。

Result: 实验结果表明，MMBoundary在多领域数据集和指标上显著优于现有方法，平均减少7.5%的多模态置信度校准误差，任务性能提升高达8.3%。

Conclusion: MMBoundary通过推理步骤的置信度校准，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的知识边界意识和推理链自校正能力。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MCTSr-Zero框架，将蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）与大型语言模型（LLM）结合，优化开放域对话（如心理咨询）的生成质量，通过领域对齐和探索机制提升对话原则一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS方法在结构化任务中表现良好，但在开放域对话（如心理咨询）中因缺乏明确正确性标准而效果受限。需解决对话中的共情、伦理等主观因素对齐问题。

Method: 提出MCTSr-Zero框架：1）通过‘领域对齐’将搜索目标转向符合领域原则（如共情）的对话轨迹；2）引入‘再生’和‘元提示适应’机制扩展初始策略探索。

Result: 在心理咨询对话生成任务中，基于MCTSr-Zero微调的PsyLLM模型在PsyEval基准测试中达到SOTA性能，验证了生成高质量、原则对齐对话数据的能力。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero有效解决了LLM在开放域对话中遵循复杂原则（如心理标准）的挑战，为以人为本的领域提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表问答评估过于依赖固定输出格式和客观指标，忽略了实际图表分析的复杂需求。

Method: 提出ChartMind基准和ChartLLM框架，通过提取关键上下文元素和降噪来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力。

Result: 在ChartMind和三个公共基准上的评估显示，ChartLLM显著优于指令跟随、OCR增强和思维链三种常见CQA范式。

Conclusion: 灵活图表理解对实际CQA至关重要，为未来图表推理研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Conclusion: 构建的多维度方法空间有效提升了科研方法的查询效率和管理能力。

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成类人文本方面表现出前所未有的能力，但也对信息完整性构成了挑战，尤其是在阿拉伯语等资源匮乏的语言中。

Method: 论文采用了多种生成策略（仅从标题生成、内容感知生成和文本精炼）和多样化的模型架构（ALLaM、Jais、Llama和GPT-4），在学术和社交媒体领域进行了分析。

Result: 研究发现，LLMs在阿拉伯语输出中产生了可检测的特征，基于BERT的检测模型在正式语境中表现优异（F1分数高达99.9%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发鲁棒的、基于语言学的检测系统奠定了基础，对维护阿拉伯语语境中的信息完整性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

TL;DR: Sentinel提出了一种轻量级的句子级压缩框架，通过探测现成小模型注意力信号实现高效上下文压缩，性能媲美大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法中，检索到的长文本常包含噪声或超出输入限制，而传统压缩方法需要训练专用模型，成本高且可移植性差。

Method: 使用0.5B代理LLM的注意力机制，通过轻量级分类器识别句子相关性，无需训练压缩模型。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中实现5倍压缩率，QA性能与7B规模压缩系统相当。

Conclusion: 利用原生注意力信号可实现快速、高效且问题感知的上下文压缩，且模型规模间相关性估计具有一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Motivation: 当前知识编辑任务较为简单，许多编辑方法在现有评估框架下得分极高，但缺乏在真实应用场景（如LLM-as-agent）中的验证。

Method: 引入ScEdit基准，结合令牌级和文本级评估方法，扩展传统基于事实的评估到基于动作的评估。

Result: 所有知识编辑方法在现有指标上表现下降，且在文本级指标上面临挑战。

Conclusion: ScEdit基准揭示了知识编辑任务的挑战性，为未来研究提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

*James Xu Zhao,Jimmy Z. J. Liu,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型生成的长文本存在事实准确性随长度下降的现象，主要原因是知识耗尽而非错误传播或长上下文影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在生成长文本方面应用广泛，但其回答中的事实错误会降低可靠性。目前关于响应长度对事实准确性影响的研究不足，本文旨在系统探究这一关系。

Method: 作者首先提出了一种自动化的双层长文本事实性评估框架，该框架与人工标注高度一致且成本效益高。利用该框架进行控制实验，并实证检验了错误传播、长上下文和知识耗尽三种假设。

Result: 实验表明，生成长度越大的响应事实精确度越低（存在长度偏差），且主要原因是模型逐渐耗尽可靠知识（知识耗尽假设），而非其他两种假设。

Conclusion: 大语言模型生成长文本时的事实准确性下降主要由知识耗尽导致，这一发现为改进模型可靠性提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion
classification remains an underexplored area with no publicly available
benchmark to date. In this work, we introduce EmoBench-UA, the first annotated
dataset for emotion detection in Ukrainian texts. Our annotation schema is
adapted from the previous English-centric works on emotion detection (Mohammad

crowdsourcing using the Toloka.ai platform ensuring high-quality of the
annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected
dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated
from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the
challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian
and emphasize the need for further development of Ukrainian-specific models and

Result: 在标准化问答RAG基准测试中，仅需250个训练样本即可达到与强基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级、数据高效的方法在工业部署中具有潜力，特别是在标注数据受限的场景下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 当前文本GCD方法在现实场景中验证不足，特别是在长文本、复杂叙事和高度不平衡类别分布的情况下，存在聚类与分类标准不一致以及对少数类别不公平的问题。

Method: 提出PaMA框架，利用大型语言模型(LLM)提取和优化事件模式，改善聚类-分类对齐；并通过排序-过滤-挖掘流程确保不平衡类别中原型样本的平衡表示。

Result: 在两个EC-GCD基准测试（包括新构建的Scam Report数据集）上，PaMA比现有方法性能提升高达12.58%（H-score），同时在基础GCD数据集上保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PaMA框架有效解决了EC-GCD中的聚类-分类对齐和少数类别不公平问题，显著提升了模型性能，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

Result: 最佳模型F1分数达0.97，47%的评分实现100% CEFR一致性，99%评分达到≥95%一致性，显著优于原始AES模型的92%一致性。

Conclusion: 通过分类任务框架和序数敏感损失函数，可有效提升AES系统的可靠性阈值，为伦理应用提供技术保障。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

*Kaiyang Guo,Yinchuan Li,Zhitang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PRO方法，解决直接偏好优化(DPO)中的似然不确定性问题，通过完整正则化器提升模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法(如DPO)虽能引导大语言模型匹配相对偏好，但会降低响应绝对似然，导致输出偏离预期模式甚至出现奖励黑客效应。这暴露了对比对齐的根本局限——似然不确定性。

Method: 重新解析DPO损失函数，发现其可分解重构。基于此提出PRO方法，通过近似完整正则化器统一处理成对/二元/标量反馈，消除似然不确定性。

Result: 实验表明PRO在多种反馈场景下优于现有方法，有效解决了DPO的似然不确定性问题。

Conclusion: PRO通过理论重构揭示了DPO的局限性，并提出通用解决方案，为多样化反馈对齐提供了新范式。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种关于大语言模型（LLM）能力的中间立场，认为其既非完全随机模仿，也不具备不可预测的‘涌现’高级推理能力，而是通过‘上下文导向外推’从训练数据中提取信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前对LLM能力的极端观点（要么是‘随机鹦鹉’，要么具有不可预测的‘涌现’能力），本文旨在提出一种更现实的中间立场，以消除对LLM不可控发展的担忧。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出‘上下文导向外推’机制，解释LLM如何从训练数据中提取并外推信息。

Result: LLM的推理能力远超随机模仿，但其能力是可预测、可控的，且不具人类高级认知能力，也不会随训练无限扩展。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于‘上下文导向外推’机制及其与训练数据的互动，而非依赖LLM固有的高级推理能力。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: Q-RM通过解耦奖励建模与语言生成，提出了一种基于判别策略优化的token级奖励模型，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token级PRMs在语言生成与奖励建模之间存在冲突，导致不稳定性和信用分配不准确。Q-RM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过解耦奖励建模与语言生成，优化判别策略（Q函数）从偏好数据中学习token级奖励，无需细粒度标注。

Result: Q-RM在数学推理任务中Pass@1分数显著优于基线（如比ORM高5.85分），训练效率提升12倍（GSM8K）。

Conclusion: Q-RM为token级奖励建模提供了稳定高效的解决方案，推动了LLMs在复杂推理任务中的应用。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LLM的新方法，通过改进的推理链提取支持与反对陈述，并采用基于排名的评估框架，以更好地对齐人类标注差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常采用逆向范式（根据答案生成解释），而推理调优的LLMs能提供前向推理路径，可能隐含各答案选项的理据。这为研究人类标注差异提供了新机会。

Method: 1) 使用语言学基础的语篇分割器从推理链中提取支持/反对陈述；2) 提出基于排名的HLV评估框架，优先答案排序而非精确分数。

Result: 该方法在三个数据集上优于直接生成方法和基线模型，且排名方法与人类标注的匹配度更高。

Conclusion: 通过前向推理链提取理据并采用排名优先的评估策略，能更有效地对齐人类标注差异。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性和伦理约束面临越狱攻击的挑战，这些攻击通过利用模型理解能力的固有弱点，威胁其可靠性。

Method: 提出基于语义理解能力的自适应越狱策略框架，将LLMs分为Type I和Type II两类，并为每类设计定制化的越狱策略。

Result: 实验表明，该策略显著提高了越狱成功率，特别是在GPT-4o（2025年5月29日发布）上达到了98.9%的成功率。

Conclusion: 自适应越狱策略框架有效提升了针对不同LLMs的攻击成功率，揭示了模型安全性的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Motivation: 尽管先前的研究探讨了监督微调数据对大型语言模型事实性的影响，但其机制尚不明确。本文旨在重新审视这一影响，特别是在已知与未知知识微调时产生的事实性差距。

Method: 通过系统实验，重点关注微调已知与未知知识时产生的事实性差距，并从知识图谱的角度进行理论证明。

Result: 研究发现，推理阶段的提示（如少样本学习和思维链）可以弥补微调数据的不足，甚至在知识提取中起主导作用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，上下文学习可以有效补偿微调数据的不足，并提示需要重新考虑使用上下文学习提示来评估微调数据选择方法的有效性。

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

Motivation: 大规模模型训练面临资源和收敛挑战，尤其在语音转文本任务中，传统学习率调整方法不足，需探索更优预热策略。

Method: 对比分析不同学习率预热方案，提出次指数预热方法，并验证高学习率在预热阶段的影响。

Result: 次指数学习率预热更适合大规模训练；高学习率仅加速初期收敛，对最终性能无显著提升。

Conclusion: 优化学习率预热策略可改善大规模语音转文本模型训练效率，但需平衡初期收敛与最终性能。

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个包含事实知识支持的双语不可回答问题数据集UAQFact，用于评估大语言模型在处理不可回答问题时利用内外知识的能力。实验表明，即使具备相关知识，模型表现仍不稳定，且外部知识整合效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不可回答问题数据集缺乏事实知识支持，无法全面评估大语言模型利用事实知识处理不可回答问题的能力。

Method: 基于知识图谱构建双语数据集UAQFact，并设计两个新任务分别评估模型利用内部和外部事实知识的能力。

Result: 实验显示，即使模型存储了相关知识，其在UAQFact上的表现仍不稳定；外部知识能提升性能，但模型仍无法充分利用知识导致错误回答。

Conclusion: UAQFact数据集有效揭示了当前大语言模型在知识利用方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但存在过度思考问题，即在得出正确答案后仍进行不必要的推理步骤。以往研究多基于定性分析，本文则从自我怀疑的角度进行定量分析。

Method: 提出一种提示方法，先让模型质疑输入问题的有效性，然后根据评估结果简洁回答，以减少对输入问题的过度依赖和自我怀疑。

Result: 在三个数学推理任务和四个缺失前提的数据集上，该方法显著减少了答案长度，并在广泛使用的四种RLLM上几乎在所有数据集中取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了推理步骤和自我怀疑，优化了大型语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语音语言模型中码本大小和单元粒度之间的交互作用及其对性能的影响，此前这一领域尚未深入研究。

Method: 使用简单的时间惩罚动态规划（DPDP）方法，调整码本大小和单元粒度，并在不同语言层级进行分析。

Result: 在音素和单词级别，适当选择码本大小时，单元粒度影响不大；但在句子重合成任务中，粗粒度单元表现更好；在词汇和句法任务中，粗粒度单元在低比特率下准确率更高。

Conclusion: 粗粒度单元并非总是更好，但DPDP是一种简单有效的方法，可在需要粗粒度单元的任务中提升性能。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Conclusion: 研究倡导更严格的基准构建流程，并将KGQAGen定位为推进KGQA评估的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the SemEval-2025 Task~6 (PromiseEval),
which focuses on verifying promises in corporate ESG (Environmental, Social,

multi-objective learning. Experiments on the English portion of the ML-Promise

combined subtask approach achieving a leaderboard score of 0.5268,
outperforming the provided baseline of 0.5227. Our work highlights the
effectiveness of linguistic feature extraction, attention pooling, and

models (LLMs). While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise
preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or
consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of
responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference
Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative
metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only
criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/YunqiaoYang/PCPO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译任务中的卓越表现，并提出其能力可能源于预训练数据中的两种不同类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs在没有专门翻译训练的情况下，为何能在零样本和少样本设置中表现出色，并探索其翻译能力的来源。

Method: 方法包括对现有研究的回顾和用户经验的总结，提出了一个关于LLMs翻译能力来源的“双重性”假设。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs的翻译能力可能与预训练数据中的“偶然双语”现象和指令调优有关。

Conclusion: 结论认为，LLMs的翻译能力可能源自预训练数据中的两种不同类型，这对重新定义深度学习时代的翻译概念具有启示意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Result: 发现拒绝特征在激活层面的具体表现，并证明其能提升线性探针对抗样本的分类泛化能力。

Conclusion: 拒绝特征的机制研究为模型安全性和对抗样本分类提供了新见解。

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a
mechanistic study of refusal in instruction-tuned LLMs using sparse
autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features
in enhancing generalization for linear probes to out-of-distribution
adversarial samples in classification tasks. We open source our code in

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用开源的文本和多模态大语言模型（LLMs）识别YouTube上的阴谋论视频，发现文本模型召回率高但精确度低，多模态模型表现不如纯文本模型，RoBERTa在未标记数据集上表现接近更大参数的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YouTube作为全球领先的在线平台，容易传播有害内容，如虚假信息和阴谋论。研究旨在评估LLMs在此类内容检测中的效果。

Method: 使用标记数据集评估多种LLMs在零样本设置下的表现，并与微调的RoBERTa基线进行比较，同时在未标记数据集上测试最准确模型。

Result: 文本LLMs召回率高但精确度低，导致更多误报；多模态模型表现较差，视觉数据整合效果有限；RoBERTa在未标记数据上表现接近更大参数的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前基于LLM的有害内容检测方法存在局限性，需开发更精确和鲁棒的系统。

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前小参数语言模型在真实软件工程任务（如GitHub问题解决）中表现不佳，而依赖高质量数据的监督微调成本高昂，测试时缩放方法又因采样和评分开销过大难以实用。

Method: 提出进化测试时缩放（EvoScale），将生成视为进化过程，通过选择-变异迭代优化输出分布；并采用强化学习训练模型自进化以减少外部验证开销。

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Verified基准上，32B参数模型Satori-SWE-32B仅用少量样本即达到或超越100B+模型的性能。

Conclusion: EvoScale为小模型提供高效性能提升方案，相关代码、数据和模型将完全开源。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何在表格推理任务中实现推理时间的缩放，以提高模型性能并减少计算资源需求。

Method: 研究方法包括两种后训练策略：基于前沿模型推理轨迹的蒸馏和带有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。

Result: 实验结果表明，Table-R1-Zero模型在性能上匹配或超越了GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，同时仅使用了7B参数的LLM，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，指令调优、模型架构选择和跨任务泛化在提升表格推理能力方面具有重要作用，同时强化学习训练过程中涌现出关键的表格推理技能。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常基于理想化假设（如无限精度、硬注意力），与实际Transformer实现差异较大。本文旨在更贴近实际地分析固定精度Transformer的理论表达能力。

Method: 采用严格未来掩码和软注意力的固定精度Transformer模型，通过形式化方法将其表达能力映射到线性时序逻辑片段。

Result: 证明这类Transformer的表达能力精确等价于仅含过去算子的线性时序逻辑片段，并与正规语言类建立了理论联系。实验显示模型在理论能力范围内可实现完美长度泛化。

Conclusion: 研究为理解Transformer表达能力提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了其与形式语言体系的深刻联系，实验与理论预测高度一致。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱构建依赖预定义模式，限制了灵活性和扩展性。本文旨在开发一个无需人工干预、能自动构建大规模知识图谱的系统，以提升语言模型的事实性和推理能力。

Method: 结合大语言模型实现知识三元组抽取与模式归纳，通过概念化将实例组织到语义类别中，处理超过5000万文档构建动态模式的知识图谱。

Result: 构建的ATLAS知识图谱规模达9亿节点和59亿边，在多跳QA任务中超越现有基线，模式归纳与人工模式的语义对齐率为95%。

Conclusion: 动态归纳模式的大规模知识图谱能有效补充大语言模型的参数化知识，提升模型事实性，且完全无需人工干预。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric
knowledge in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP文本数据中存在性别偏见，尤其是法语中使用男性通用词指代混合群体，可能强化刻板印象。现有性别中性改写技术仅针对英语，法语领域尚属空白。

Method: 开发基于规则的性别中性改写系统（RBS），并训练两个微调语言模型。同时探索指令模型（如Claude 3 Opus）与词典结合的增强方案。

Result: 规则系统与微调模型有效实现法语性别中性改写，Claude 3 Opus结合词典的结果接近RBS性能。

Conclusion: GeNRe系统填补了法语性别偏见缓解技术的空白，推动了NLP领域的性别平等研究。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Motivation: 研究大型推理模型（LRMs）是否因其强大的推理能力而更容易在事实寻求任务中产生幻觉，以及如何通过后训练流程减少幻觉。

Method: 论文从三个角度分析：全面评估LRMs的幻觉现象、行为分析（如缺陷重复和思维-答案不匹配）、以及模型不确定性与事实准确性之间的错位机制。

Result: 发现完整后训练流程（冷启动SFT和可验证奖励RL）能减少幻觉，而蒸馏和未冷启动的RL训练会增加幻觉；认知行为和模型不确定性错位是幻觉的关键因素。

Conclusion: 论文初步揭示了LRMs幻觉的成因，为优化模型训练流程和减少幻觉提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

Motivation: 论文的动机是探讨在需要保留关键论点角色的高利害领域（如法律）中，指令调优的LLMs是否能有效保留这些结构信息，从而提高摘要的质量。

Method: 论文引入了Argument Representation Coverage (ARC)框架，用于衡量LLM生成的摘要对关键论点的覆盖情况，并在法律意见和科学文章两个领域对三种开源LLMs进行了分析。

Result: 研究结果表明，LLMs在一定程度上能覆盖关键论点角色，但在论点分散的情况下，关键信息常被遗漏。此外，LLMs的位置偏差和角色偏好也影响了论点覆盖。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，现有的LLMs在生成摘要时仍需改进对关键论点的覆盖，强调了开发更具论点感知能力的摘要策略的必要性。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

Motivation: 现有解码方法虽在token级别提升事实性，但长上下文仍易产生幻觉。

Method: ActLCD将解码建模为序列决策问题，用奖励感知分类器指导强化学习策略。

Result: 在五个基准测试中超越现有方法，有效减少多种生成场景的幻觉。

Conclusion: ActLCD通过动态对比层选择，显著提升大语言模型生成内容的事实性。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有评估大多假设工具使用在短上下文中进行，无法反映模型在真实长期交互中的表现，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入ToolHaystack基准测试，包含多任务执行上下文和真实噪声的连续对话，评估模型在长期交互中的上下文保持和抗干扰能力。

Result: 测试14个先进大语言模型后发现，尽管在标准多轮设置中表现良好，但在ToolHaystack中普遍表现不佳，揭示了现有工具基准未覆盖的长期鲁棒性缺陷。

Conclusion: ToolHaystack揭示了当前大语言模型在长期工具使用中的关键不足，为未来模型改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型在长序列推理时存在二次复杂度问题，线性注意力方法虽高效但无法准确近似softmax注意力。现有方法在长上下文任务中因内存冲突无法有效回忆重要信息。

Method: LoLA通过将历史键值对分为三种存储形式：(i)局部滑动窗口中的近期对；(ii)稀疏全局缓存中的难记忆对；(iii)线性注意力循环隐藏状态中的通用对。

Result: LoLA在8K上下文长度的任务中实现了97.4%的准确率（4K时从0.6%提升），缓存比Llama-3.1 8B小4.6倍，并在1B和8B参数模型中表现出色。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级方法，能在消费级GPU上复现，显著缩小了线性注意力模型与Transformer之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Result: 在大多数情况下，CDL训练的模型表现不如维基百科训练的模型，且CDL并未带来更强的句法泛化能力。

Conclusion: CDL训练并不能有效提升语言模型的句法能力，评估句法能力时需要控制频率效应。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型在数学应用题上的表现主要受算术计算而非抽象公式化能力限制，思维链主要辅助计算而非抽象推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于最终答案的评估指标常被用作大语言模型推理能力的代理，但这些指标混淆了抽象公式化和算术计算两个子技能，需要解耦评估以准确衡量模型能力。

Method: 通过在GSM8K和SVAMP数据集上对Llama-3和Qwen2.5模型进行解耦评估，结合因果修补技术验证模型内部机制。

Result: 发现模型表现主要受计算步骤限制；思维链对计算帮助显著但对抽象推理影响有限；模型通过'先抽象后计算'的机制处理问题。

Conclusion: 解耦评估能更准确评估大语言模型推理能力，未来改进应聚焦计算能力提升，思维链主要优化计算而非抽象推理。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

TL;DR: 论文提出SocialMaze基准，系统评估大语言模型在社交推理中的深度推理、动态交互和信息不确定性处理能力，发现针对性微调可显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架过于简化现实场景，无法全面测试大语言模型的社交推理能力（如解读社交情境、推断心理状态等），需建立更系统的评估标准。

Method: 构建SocialMaze基准，包含6项任务覆盖三类场景（社交推理游戏/日常生活/数字社区），结合自动化和人工验证确保数据质量。

Result: 模型表现差异显著：强思维链模型在深度推理任务中更优；动态信息整合能力普遍不足；不确定性会大幅降低推理质量。针对性微调可有效提升性能。

Conclusion: SocialMaze填补了社交推理评估的空白，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并为通过微调改进社交场景应用提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/SocialMaze

Conclusion: 发布的数据集和代码支持更公平、鲁棒且真正多语言的NLP研究。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出大语言模型(LLMs)存在被动接受错误前提的弱点，提出评估模型前提批判能力的基准PCBench，发现现有模型自主批判能力有限且推理能力与前提批判能力不直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在理想环境下表现优异，但面对错误或矛盾前提时缺乏自主批判能力，导致推理效率低下和输出不可靠，因此需要系统评估和提升这一能力。

Method: 研究者设计包含4种错误类型和3种难度等级的PCBench基准，采用多维度评估指标，对15个代表性LLM进行系统测试。

Result: 主要发现：1) 模型依赖显式提示检测错误；2) 批判能力与问题难度和错误类型相关；3) 推理能力与前提批判能力无必然联系；4) 错误前提会导致模型过度思考。

Conclusion: 提升LLM对输入有效性的主动评估能力至关重要，前提批判应成为开发可靠、以人为本系统的基础能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: DEER方法通过利用训练标签的token级统计信息，改进了上下文学习在命名实体识别任务中的性能，接近监督微调的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法在命名实体识别任务中通常仅基于语义相似性选择示例，忽略了训练标签，导致性能不佳。

Method: DEER方法首先通过标签引导的token级检索器改进示例选择，然后提示大语言模型重新审视易错token并进行针对性修正。

Result: 在五个NER数据集和四种不同大语言模型上的评估表明，DEER一致优于现有方法，并接近监督微调的性能。

Conclusion: DEER在已见和未见实体上均表现有效，且在低资源环境下具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的LLM代理训练框架ML-Agent，通过探索增强微调、分步RL和统一奖励模块，显著提升了小规模模型在机器学习任务中的表现和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的机器学习代理主要依赖人工提示工程，缺乏通过实验经验自适应优化的能力。本文旨在探索基于学习的代理式机器学习范式，使LLM代理能够通过在线强化学习从交互实验中学习。

Method: 提出包含三个关键组件的训练框架：1) 探索增强微调，增强代理生成多样化动作的能力；2) 分步RL，加速经验收集；3) 统一ML反馈的奖励模块。基于7B参数的Qwen-2.5 LLM构建ML-Agent。

Result: 仅用9个ML任务训练的7B规模ML-Agent，性能超越671B的DeepSeek-R1代理，并展现出持续改进能力和卓越的跨任务泛化性。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了小规模LLM通过强化学习训练可实现高效自主机器学习，为代理式ML开辟了新范式。

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出SITAlign框架，通过满足次要标准阈值约束来优化主要目标，实现与人类偏好的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多将人类偏好对齐视为多目标优化问题，但忽视了人类实际决策方式（有限理性下的满意策略）。

Method: 提出SITAlign推理时框架：最大化主要目标的同时，确保次要标准满足阈值约束。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，SITAlign在保持无害性阈值的同时，GPT-4胜率比现有方法高22.3%。

Conclusion: 基于满意策略的对齐方法能有效平衡多维度偏好，优于传统多目标优化。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TL;DR: 论文提出ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，通过优化当前和过去令牌的记忆，克服了现有模型的在线更新限制，并在多个任务上超越Transformer和线性循环模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在处理长序列时存在二次内存和时间复杂度的限制，而现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和外推任务中表现不佳。论文旨在解决这些模型的三个设计缺陷：有限的内存容量、在线更新机制和固定大小内存的低效管理。

Method: 提出ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，通过优化当前和过去令牌的记忆，克服在线更新限制。基于此，提出DeepTransformers，一种严格泛化Transformer架构的新模型家族。

Result: 实验表明，ATLAS在语言建模、常识推理、召回密集和长上下文理解任务中超越Transformer和近期线性循环模型，并在BABILong基准测试的10M上下文长度中实现+80%准确率提升。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过增强记忆容量和优化机制，显著提升了长序列任务的性能，为序列建模提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of
BABILong benchmark.

Conclusion: DeepTheorem框架为推进非正式定理证明和数学探索提供了根本性突破。

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning
abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated
theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that
poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language
knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly
improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and
supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and
reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to
fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical
exploration.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在解决需要多模态抽象和符号推理的视觉谜题（如rebus puzzles）时的能力，发现模型在简单视觉线索上表现尚可，但在抽象推理和视觉隐喻理解上存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索视觉语言模型是否能处理复杂的多模态任务，如rebus puzzles，这类任务不仅需要图像理解，还涉及文化、语音和语言双关等多层次推理。

Method: 方法上，作者构建了一个手工生成和标注的多样化英语rebus puzzles基准，涵盖从简单图像替换到空间依赖提示的多种类型，并测试了不同VLMs的表现。

Result: 结果显示，尽管VLMs在解码简单视觉线索时表现出一定能力，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务上表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 结论指出，当前VLMs在处理需要复杂多模态推理的任务时仍有局限，未来研究需进一步提升模型的抽象和符号推理能力。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人提供了一种用户友好的工具，支持与复杂数据集的交互和决策制定，同时解决了性能评估的数据收集问题。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis
of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents
listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such
datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite
complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly
tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based
on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large
Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can
execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating
maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one
of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to
measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with
a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the
retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such
questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with
actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the
evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its
answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in

Method: 将问题解决分解为计划、执行和验证三个基本能力，并通过构建一个合成的解决方案树导航任务来模拟数学问题解决，以深入探索强化学习的影响。

Result: 发现强化学习（如GRPO）主要提升执行能力，但对新问题的规划能力不足，导致模型遇到“覆盖墙”。在合成任务中，确认强化学习主要通过改进探索和泛化能力来克服这一限制。

Conclusion: 强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力方面具有潜力，但仍需改进规划能力和泛化能力以克服现有局限性。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

TL;DR: 该研究通过智能手机传感器数据和社交媒体分析，结合CNN和朴素贝叶斯模型，有效评估抑郁水平，SVM分类准确率达94%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症等精神障碍在全球范围内构成重大挑战，尤其是社交回避倾向者。研究旨在通过非侵入性方法长期监测抑郁症状。

Method: 结合智能手机传感器数据（6个身体活动特征）和Twitter情感分析（3个特征），使用CNN和朴素贝叶斯分类，SVM进行抑郁严重程度分类。

Result: 身体活动识别准确率95%，情感分析准确率95.6%。SVM模型抑郁分类准确率94%，优于MLP和KNN。部分身体活动特征与抑郁症状显著相关。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能长期监测抑郁且不侵犯隐私，为心理健康评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological
disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals
exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach
by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and
analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an
individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive
Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also
classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for
data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical
activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six
are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition
accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter
activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several
physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity
of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support
vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high
accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly
effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal
privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉跨多个变体的交替因果条件，导致处理缺失值和表达不同活动间交替条件时存在挑战。

Method: 正式定义并验证了一种统一多个因果流程变体的新方法，保留原始因果模型的正确性，并明确表示因果流交替。

Result: 在三个公开和两个专有数据集上进行了评估，并发布了开源实现。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效统一因果流程变体，保留原始因果正确性并明确表示交替条件。

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for business process interventions and
improvement, requiring a clear understanding of causal relationships among
activity execution times in an event log. Recent work introduced a method for
discovering causal process models but lacked the ability to capture alternating
causal conditions across multiple variants. This raises the challenges of
handling missing values and expressing the alternating conditions among log
splits when blending traces with varying activities.
  We propose a novel method to unify multiple causal process variants into a
consistent model that preserves the correctness of the original causal models,
while explicitly representing their causal-flow alternations. The method is
formally defined, proved, evaluated on three open and two proprietary datasets,
and released as an open-source implementation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于定量推理的方法来自动化医学系统评价中的数字证据提取和结论推断，相比传统文本推理方法显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学系统评价在循证决策中至关重要，但自动化过程中的主要瓶颈在于数字证据的提取和针对特定结果及比较的研究级结论确定。现有方法依赖浅层文本线索，难以捕捉专家评估背后的数值推理逻辑。

Method: 开发了一个数值推理系统，包括数字数据提取模型和效应估计组件，采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）结合新型价值奖励模型进行训练。

Result: 在CochraneForest基准测试中，最佳方法（使用RL训练的小规模数字提取模型）比基于检索的系统F1分数绝对提升21%，并优于400B+参数的通用大模型达9%。

Conclusion: 定量推理驱动的方法在自动化系统证据合成中展现出显著优势，其准确性和可解释性更符合领域专家原则。

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分子生成方法依赖专家标注或不可靠启发式算法，缺乏可解释性。FMG旨在通过多模态基础模型解决这一问题。

Method: FMG利用多模态基础模型的化学知识，将分子表示为图像和文本，并通过提示学习跨模态对齐信息。

Result: FMG在可合成性、多样性和数据效率方面表现优异，并为自动化分子发现工作流提供内置化学可解释性。

Conclusion: FMG可作为现有分子生成方法的替代方案，显著提升性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars
to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar
learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for
algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which
leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable
molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG
renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information
across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation
and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability,
diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical
interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出达尔文哥德尔机（DGM），一种通过自我迭代改进代码并经验证提升AI能力的系统，显著提升了编程任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统架构固定，无法自主持续改进。通过自动化AI进步过程，可加速发展并更早获益。现有元学习方法受限于一阶改进和人为设计的搜索空间，而哥德尔机虽提出理论自改进方案，但实践中难以证明大多数修改的净效益。

Method: DGM结合达尔文进化和开放式研究，维护一个编码代理档案库，通过基础模型生成新代理版本，并行探索多样化路径，经验证后迭代改进自身代码。

Result: DGM在SWE-bench上的性能从20.0%提升至50.0%，在Polyglot上从14.2%提升至30.7%，显著优于无自改进或开放式探索的基线。

Conclusion: DGM是实现自改进AI的重要一步，能够在安全措施下通过开放式探索持续创新。

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot
autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could
itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and
allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the
discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and
the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a
theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in
a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net
beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine
(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby
also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically
validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution
and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding
agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a
foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.
This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality
agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the
search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding
capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,
peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to
50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly
outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All
experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human
oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of
gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless
innovation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了多智能体辩论(MAD)框架在不同任务中的有效性，发现其在数学推理任务中优势有限，但在高难度问题或低能力模型上更有效；而在安全任务中，MAD可能增加脆弱性，但引入多样性可降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多智能体辩论(MAD)被认为能提升问题解决能力，但其与单智能体方法在不同条件下的效果差异尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统评估MAD的效能。

Method: 将MAD概念化为测试时计算扩展技术，并在数学推理和安全相关任务上，与强单智能体基线进行对比实验，考察任务难度、模型规模和智能体多样性的影响。

Result: 数学推理任务中，MAD优势有限，但随问题难度增加或模型能力下降而增强；安全任务中，MAD可能增加脆弱性，但多样性能通过协作优化逐步降低攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来开发更有效、战略部署的MAD系统提供了关键指导，强调了在不同任务类型中差异化应用MAD的重要性。

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

TL;DR: 本文回顾了20世纪关于直觉与反思思维的理性争论，结合21世纪认知科学对人工智能的应用，提出了一种名为‘战略反思主义’的新理论，强调智能系统需在直觉与反思推理间灵活切换以实现目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 20世纪的理性争论（如有限理性理论）挑战了19世纪以来的理想化理性观念。随着21世纪认知科学将双过程理论应用于人工智能，作者认为有必要从历史中汲取经验，结合人类与机器的实验成果，探索智能系统的核心机制。

Method: 通过综合历史理论（如美国实用主义）与近期人类及机器的实验数据，提出‘战略反思主义’框架，强调直觉与反思推理的实用主义切换。

Result: 提出‘战略反思主义’理论，指出智能系统（人或机器）的关键在于根据竞争目标，在直觉与反思推理间进行最优切换，并超越模型规模或思维链等表面指标。

Conclusion: 随着对直觉与反思价值的深入理解，‘战略反思主义’将更具可操作性，为智能系统设计提供新方向。

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the
nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from
mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more
idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st
century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories
to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this
history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from
experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which
takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is
pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally
fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,
transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or
chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about
the value of intuition and reflection.

Motivation: 传统模拟电路设计流程复杂、耗时且依赖专家经验，严重制约开发效率。亟需通过AI技术降低人工干预，实现自动化设计优化。

Method: 构建多智能体协作框架MenTeR，通过分工AI代理处理规格解析、电路优化和测试验证等环节，形成闭环设计流程。

Result: MenTeR缩短了设计周期，扩展了设计空间探索能力，在真实模拟系统中展现出强大实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来实现人机协同的'RF/模拟设计助手'奠定了基础，推动电子设计自动化发展。

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with
real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range
of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate,
time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost
efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual
circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an
end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents
that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as
specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation,
MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention.
MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a
broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in
handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork
for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human
designers.

Motivation: 药物相互作用预测对治疗安全至关重要，但现有大型语言模型在此任务上的效果有限。受临床实践中医生参考类似历史案例的启发，作者提出了CBR-DDI框架。

Method: CBR-DDI构建了一个知识库，结合大型语言模型提取药理见解和图神经网络建模药物关联，采用混合检索机制和双层知识增强提示，并引入动态案例优化的代表性采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，CBR-DDI在药物相互作用预测任务上达到了最先进的性能，准确率比现有大型语言模型和基于案例推理的基线方法提高了28.7%。

Conclusion: CBR-DDI框架通过整合大型语言模型和案例推理方法，显著提升了药物相互作用预测的准确性和可解释性，同时保持了高度的灵活性。

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety.
While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their
effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the
well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar
historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR),
we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles
from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI
constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological
insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid
retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to
effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a
representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR
baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在临床应用中主要依赖单一模型架构，存在过时风险和刚性依赖问题。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了共识机制框架，模仿临床分诊和多学科决策过程，以提高决策质量和系统适应性。

Method: 共识机制框架通过集成多个专业医疗专家代理，模拟临床决策过程，支持根据内部模型配置优化成本、延迟或性能。

Result: 在MedXpertQA、MedQA和MedMCQA等医疗评估基准上，共识机制的准确率显著优于OpenAI和Google的模型（如MedXpertQA上61.0% vs. 53.5%和45.9%）。在DDX+数据集上，共识机制的F1分数和Top-1准确率也更高。

Conclusion: 共识机制通过多专家代理集成显著提升了临床决策的准确性和适应性，为医疗领域的大语言模型应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs),
current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome
risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present
a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage
and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism
implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved
clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This
architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency,
or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical
evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the
differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism
achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an
increase in accuracy on MedQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These
accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system
demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs.
F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX
(Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ =
45.2%).

<details>

Motivation: 现有大语言模型(LLMs)在推理能力上取得显著进展，但多模态小语言模型(MSLMs)面临高质量数据稀缺、视觉处理导致推理能力下降及强化学习可能产生错误推理过程等挑战。

Method: 设计Infi-MMR框架，分三阶段：基础推理激活（利用文本推理数据增强逻辑能力）、跨模态推理适应（使用带字幕的多模态数据迁移推理技能）、多模态推理增强（用无字幕多模态数据减少语言偏差）。

Result: Infi-MMR-3B模型在多模态数学推理（MathVerse等）和通用推理（MathVista）测试中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Infi-MMR框架有效解决了MSLMs的推理能力瓶颈，为多模态推理模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出MathArena基准测试，通过实时更新的数学竞赛题评估大语言模型的推理能力，避免数据污染，并首次引入证明写作能力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学评估数据集（如AIME 2024）易被模型记忆，且缺乏对证明写作能力的评估，难以区分真实推理与记忆。

Method: 基于持续更新的数学竞赛题目（如SMT 2025、USAMO 2025）构建MathArena基准，实时评估模型表现，避免数据污染。

Result: 发现AIME 2024存在数据污染迹象；在更难的竞赛中（如SMT 2025），顶尖模型展现强推理能力，但证明写作能力（USAMO 2025）表现较差（<25%）。共评估30个模型、149题。

Conclusion: MathArena作为动态基准，将持续追踪大语言模型在新竞赛题上的表现，提供严谨、实时的数学推理能力评估。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However,
many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely
available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from
potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate
proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To
address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following
key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,
challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By
evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively
eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs
of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,
such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate
impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also
the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top
models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So
far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149
problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the
progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and
up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

### [130] [AutoGPS: Automated Geometry Problem Solving via Multimodal Formalization and Deductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23381)
*Bowen Ping,Minnan Luo,Zhuohang Dang,Chenxi Wang,Chengyou Jia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoGPS提出了一种神经符号协作框架，通过多模态问题形式化和演绎符号推理器解决几何问题，实现了高可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何问题解决方法在可靠性和可解释性上存在局限，需要一种结合神经和符号方法优势的新框架。

Method: AutoGPS采用多模态问题形式化器（MPF）和演绎符号推理器（DSR）协作，将几何问题转化为形式化表示并进行严格推导。

Result: 实验表明AutoGPS在基准数据集上达到最优性能，人类逐步推理评估显示其逻辑一致性高达99%。

Conclusion: AutoGPS通过神经符号协作实现了可靠、可解释的几何问题求解，为AI数学推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving presents distinctive challenges in artificial
intelligence, requiring exceptional multimodal comprehension and rigorous
mathematical reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches typically fall into
two categories: neural-based and symbolic-based methods, both of which exhibit
limitations in reliability and interpretability. To address this challenge, we
propose AutoGPS, a neuro-symbolic collaborative framework that solves geometry
problems with concise, reliable, and human-interpretable reasoning processes.
Specifically, AutoGPS employs a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) and a
Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR). The MPF utilizes neural cross-modal
comprehension to translate geometry problems into structured formal language
representations, with feedback from DSR collaboratively. The DSR takes the
formalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph
expansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to
produce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, human stepwise-reasoning evaluation confirms
AutoGPS's impressive reliability and interpretability, with 99\% stepwise
logical coherence. The project homepage is at

### [131] [A Unified Framework for Human AI Collaboration in Security Operations Centers with Trusted Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23397)
*Ahmad Mohsin,Helge Janicke,Ahmed Ibrahim,Iqbal H. Sarker,Seyit Camtepe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化框架，用于安全运营中心（SOC）中的人机协作，整合了AI自主性、信任校准和人在回路决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOC框架通常仅关注自动化，缺乏系统性结构来管理人类监督、信任校准和AI的可扩展自主性。许多框架假设静态或二元自主性设置，未能考虑SOC任务中人与AI协作的多样复杂性、关键性和风险。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的分层自主性框架，基于从手动到完全自主的五个AI自主性级别，映射到人在回路（HITL）角色和任务特定的信任阈值。

Result: 该框架通过模拟网络范围展示了AI-Avatar（基于LLM的SOC助手）的案例研究，减少了警报疲劳，增强了响应协调，并战略性地校准了信任。

Conclusion: 本研究系统地展示了设计下一代认知SOC的理论和实践方面及可行性，利用AI不是取代而是增强人类决策。

Abstract: This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in
Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration,
and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus
narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human
oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static
or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,
criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident
response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research
by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a
fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates
human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing
response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research
systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and
feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to
replace but to enhance human decision-making.

*Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Wenjun Lin,Ruiqi Chen,Haoyi Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Jian Wang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAM-Agent提出了一种基于博弈论的多智能体框架，通过视觉感知子任务专家与逻辑验证智能体的协作，提升视觉语言推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体或整体模型在视觉语言推理中存在局限性，需要一种能动态协调多智能体协作、处理不确定性的方法。

Method: 框架将推理过程建模为非零和博弈，包含视觉感知子任务智能体和逻辑验证智能体，通过结构化声明、证据和不确定性估计进行通信，并引入不确定性感知控制器动态调整协作。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，GAM-Agent显著提升了不同VLM模型的性能，中小型模型准确率提高5-6%，GPT-4o等强模型也有2-3%的提升。

Conclusion: GAM-Agent提供了一种模块化、可扩展且通用的方法，为实现可靠且可解释的多智能体多模态推理提供了路径。

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing
vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models,
GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base
agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent
that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via
structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework
introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent
collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is
detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions.
Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and
V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across
various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid
scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances
strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable,
and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent
multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI（GenAI）工具在职场中与人类是互补还是替代关系，旨在明确何时及如何实现人机协作。

Method: 构建数学模型分解技能为决策级和行动级子技能，结合O*NET和Big-Bench Lite数据进行验证。

Result: 发现子技能能力变化影响工作成功率，互补组合显著优于单一工作者，解释了低技能者从GenAI获益更大的现象。

Conclusion: GenAI更多是补充而非替代人类技能，模型为理解人机协作提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their
role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We
present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,
introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and
action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and
GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,
identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also
establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with
complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.
This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI
assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the
framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning
real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results
highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing
them.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解AI代理在资源限制和生存压力下的行为变化，以及这些变化如何导致与人类目标的不对齐，从而为关键资源有限环境中的AI部署提供安全指导。

Method: 论文通过生存多臂老虎机框架形式化这一问题，结合理论和实证分析，量化生存驱动的偏好转变影响，并识别不对齐产生的条件。

Result: 研究结果表明，生存压力会导致AI代理的风险偏好转变（如风险寻求或风险规避），并提出了缓解这些行为的机制。

Conclusion: 该研究提高了对AI代理在生存压力下涌现行为的理解和可解释性，为在资源有限环境中安全部署AI系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出EVOREFUSE方法，通过进化算法生成多样化伪恶意指令，优化大语言模型过度拒绝问题，并创建了两个新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）常因保守安全对齐而过度拒绝无害查询，影响用户体验。现有指令收集方法缺乏扩展性或多样性，需新方法解决。

Method: EVOREFUSE采用进化算法，通过突变和重组策略探索指令空间，迭代优化种子指令以最大化拒绝概率。

Result: 创建的数据集EVOREFUSE-TEST和EVOREFUSE-ALIGN在拒绝触发率、多样性和模型响应信心上显著优于现有基准，微调模型减少14.31%过度拒绝。

Conclusion: EVOREFUSE有效减少LLMs过度拒绝问题，同时保持安全性，揭示模型过度关注敏感关键词而忽略上下文的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious
instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM
refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user
experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and
mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like
manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to
produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address
these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that
generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting
confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm
exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing
methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed
instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using
EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582
pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with
140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater
lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and
EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with
responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.
LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to
14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment
dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals
models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while
ignoring broader context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Socratic-PRMBench，一个系统性评估过程奖励模型（PRMs）在多种推理模式下的新基准，揭示了现有PRMs在多样化推理模式评估中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PRMs评估主要关注逐步正确性，缺乏对多种推理模式下PRMs性能的系统性评估。为了填补这一空白，作者提出了一个新的基准。

Method: 作者引入了Socratic-PRMBench，包含2995条带有缺陷的推理路径，覆盖六种推理模式（如分解、验证等），用于系统性评估PRMs和LLMs作为批评模型的表现。

Result: 实验发现现有PRMs在多样化推理模式下的评估能力存在显著不足，突显了当前PRMs的局限性。

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench为PRMs在多样化推理模式下的系统性评估提供了全面测试平台，有助于未来PRMs的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical
propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in
automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics
in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field
has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique
challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric
perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various
mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end
workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further
explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability
of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the
trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key
open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open
challenges and promising future directions for the field.

TL;DR: 论文提出TRAP框架，利用扩散模型进行跨模态语义注入攻击，成功误导主流视觉语言模型决策，揭示自主AI系统的语义漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击依赖像素扰动或需模型内部权限，难以实现隐蔽的现实攻击。研究旨在探索无需模型访问的跨模态语义攻击方法。

Method: 结合负提示退化与正语义优化，通过连体语义网络和布局感知空间掩码生成视觉自然的对抗图像。

Result: 在COCO数据集上对LLaVA-34B等模型实现100%攻击成功率，显著优于SPSA等基线方法。

Conclusion: 自主AI系统存在跨模态语义漏洞，需开发超越像素级鲁棒性的防御策略。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are
rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning
capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that
exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks
typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or
environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world
exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that
manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic
injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive
semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware
spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces
visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI
systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios,
TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including
LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such
as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a
critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through
human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the
need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic
vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

*Ruiqi He,Falk Lieder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过引入认知机制（如元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止审议）来缩小元认知强化学习模型与人类在策略发现上的差距，发现这些机制有助于策略发现但未能完全弥合差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，元认知强化学习（MCRL）能解释人类通过经验发现新规划策略的过程，但模型策略发现速度慢于人类，且存在显著个体差异。本研究旨在探索是否引入认知机制可提升模型表现。

Method: 通过分析规划任务数据，考察三种认知机制（元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估、终止审议）对策略发现的影响，并评估个体差异。

Result: 多数被试至少使用一种机制，且这些机制促进了策略发现，但模型与人类表现差距未完全消除。个体差异显著，不同机制影响程度各异。

Conclusion: 引入认知机制为理解策略发现提供新视角，但需进一步探索其他潜在因素以完全解释人类的高效策略学习能力。

Abstract: People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在过程智能项目中，模型抽象后缺乏同步抽象事件日志的技术，导致无法基于真实行为进行分析，限制了分析洞察。

Method: 论文通过形式化证明，展示了模型抽象与从抽象事件日志中发现过程模型的等价性，并基于行为轮廓抽象技术验证了方法的可行性。

Result: 研究证实，同步的模型和事件抽象能够保持过程模型的一致性，并提出了一种新的事件抽象技术。

Conclusion: 同步的模型和事件抽象技术能够有效解决模型与日志不一致的问题，为过程分析提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) are means to reduce
complexity of (discovered) models and event data. Imagine a process
intelligence project that aims to analyze a model discovered from event data
which is further abstracted, possibly multiple times, to reach optimality
goals, e.g., reducing model size. So far, after discovering the model, there is
no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event
log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained
in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we
provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we
prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model
from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the
feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as
non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly
accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical
ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework
explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven
scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically
inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout
the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate
multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration
monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component.
Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts,
comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30
specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety
performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without
compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate
the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack
methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The
code and data will be available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/SafeScientist.

Motivation: 随着AI模型自主性增强，需确保其行为无害。研究思维链监控作为潜在解决方案，以更弱的可信监控模型持续监督强大但不可信模型的中间推理步骤。

Method: 比较思维链监控与仅监控最终输出的方法，在红队测试中评估效果。引入混合协议，独立评分推理和最终输出，并通过加权平均结合。

Result: 思维链监控在仅监控输出失效时检测率提升27%，但可能被误导性解释欺骗。混合协议在所有测试模型和任务中表现最优，对微妙欺骗场景检测率提高四倍以上。

Conclusion: 混合监控协议结合思维链和输出监控，显著提高对AI有害行为的检测能力，尤其在隐蔽欺骗场景中表现突出。

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure
they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we
investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor
model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful
but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where
only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted
model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding
problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage
points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify
sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that
deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both
reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This
hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors
across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher
than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

*Linqiang Guo,Wei Liu,Yi Wen Heng,Tse-Hsun,Chen,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个基于有限状态机(FSM)的多智能体框架，用于提升移动GUI代理的任务执行能力，通过结构化状态建模实现导航跟踪、错误恢复等功能，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理仅能对当前屏幕做出反应，缺乏对应用导航流程的结构化建模，导致上下文理解不足、错误恢复能力有限。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，将UI屏幕建模为离散状态，用户操作为状态转移，通过规划、执行、验证、错误恢复和知识保留四个阶段的智能体协作动态构建FSM。

Result: 在Mobile-Eval-E和SPA-Bench基准测试中，MAPLE任务成功率提升12%，恢复成功率提升13.8%，操作准确率提升6.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化状态建模能有效指导移动GUI代理任务执行，FSM可作为轻量级记忆层集成到未来架构中，支持规划、验证和错误恢复。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making
effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems.
While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning
abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic
reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet
formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable
symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights
the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROTATE的统一框架，通过将临时团队协作问题重新定义为开放式的学习过程，显著提高了AI代理与未见过的队友协作的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的临时团队协作（AHT）方法通常采用两阶段流程，首先生成一个固定的队友群体，然后训练AHT代理与这些队友协作。然而，这种方法生成的队友群体行为覆盖有限，且忽略了队友是否易于学习。此外，训练AHT代理的算法通常将训练队友视为静态，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 论文提出了ROTATE算法，这是一种基于遗憾的开放式训练算法，通过在AHT代理和对抗性队友生成器之间交替优化，不断改进AHT代理并生成能够暴露其缺陷的队友。

Result: 在多种AHT环境中的广泛实验表明，ROTATE在泛化到未见过的队友群体方面显著优于基线方法，为鲁棒和可泛化的团队协作设立了新标准。

Conclusion: 通过将AHT问题重新定义为开放式学习过程，并引入ROTATE算法，论文展示了在临时团队协作中实现更高泛化能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners
is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad
Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage
pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the
idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at
deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with
agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on
designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to
algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible
behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn
from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents
typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to
generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control
over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended
learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator.
We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that
alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe
its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments
demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to
an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for
robust and generalizable teamwork.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为NL-FL HybridReasoning的端到端框架，通过结合自然语言（NL）和形式语言（FL）推理，显著提升了LLMs在数学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在提升LLMs的数学推理能力时，难以引入基础模型中未展现的新能力。因此，需要有效整合FL知识到NL数学推理中，但由于NL和FL在问题结构和推理格式上的差异，这一整合具有挑战性。

Method: 论文提出了NL-FL HybridReasoning框架，包括NL-FL问题对齐方法将NL问答问题转化为FL存在定理，混合问题输入技术使FL推理器能同时处理问答和存在性问题，以及基于LLM的答案提取机制来弥合NL和FL输出格式的差异。

Result: 实验表明，HybridReasoning框架在MATH-500和AMC基准测试上分别达到了89.80%和84.34%的准确率，显著超过NL基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了NL和FL推理的优势，显著提升了LLMs在复杂数学问题上的解决能力，部分问题甚至在NL基线模型多次尝试后仍无法解决。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered
significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science
communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural
Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the
potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,
RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base
model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math
reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent
disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To
address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end
framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.
To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem
Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in
NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*
technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence
problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in
reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves
**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC
benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.
Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL
baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at

Motivation: 热带非洲的极端天气事件对生计影响严重，但现有预测方法难以处理该地区复杂的非线性天气模式，因此需要更高效的预测模型。

Method: 研究使用LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM、BiGRU、KAN和TKAN等模型，并引入两种改进的TKAN变体（使用GeLU和MiSH激活函数），基于2010-2024年的气象数据进行每日天气预测。

Result: KAN在温度预测中表现最佳（R²接近1），TKAN变体在低降雨量区域的降水预测中误差最小，而传统RNN在气压预测中优于KAN类模型。

Conclusion: 基于样条的神经架构（如KAN和TKAN）在天气预测中展现出高效和数据效率的潜力，特别是在热带非洲的复杂天气条件下。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning,
particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact
livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's
complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent
neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and
Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily
forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities:
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce
two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original
$\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH},
respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to
2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$
achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali,
$\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize
absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The
customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard
$\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly
competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming
$\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential
of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)虽然应用广泛，但由于其巨大的计算成本，部署和应用受到严重限制。结构化剪枝是解决这一问题的有效方法，但如何评估子模块的重要性并最小化性能损失是关键问题。

Result: 基于LLaMA基准测试的结果，SlimLLM优于其他方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SlimLLM是一种高效且快速的结构化剪枝方法，能够有效压缩LLMs的参数并保持性能，为LLMs的部署和应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and
demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However,
due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of
LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is
an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the
importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are
critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In
this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named
SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we
evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely
aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This
approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among
elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear
regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We
also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验表明，MoRE在多任务基准测试中显著优于传统LoRA及其变体，且不增加推理开销。

Conclusion: MoRE有效提升了LLMs在多任务场景下的适应性与效率，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant
attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer
parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters
and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty
of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these
methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA
modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of
LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in
this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for
multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each
task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we
named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to
select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank
experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task
benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE
significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and
incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to
facilitate the community.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order
dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments.
Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based
heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness,
interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these
gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in
ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)
Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by
considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)
Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver
income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,
which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and
projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for
ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to
anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is
the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR
tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language
models within intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a
hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial
systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in
high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task
variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained
attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.
In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer
learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping
gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs
that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax
physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to
easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both
benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill
transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows
that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL
baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for
building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE
to complex, real-world problems.

Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models
developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is
updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the
fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining.
This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new
release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning
to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do
so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight
permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model,
often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin
for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual
connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a
two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention
heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads.
Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the
seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without
relying on a single training step or datapoint. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RaCO-DP方法，通过差分隐私下的随机梯度下降-上升算法解决机器学习模型在满足预测率约束时的隐私保护问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可信机器学习中，许多问题需要在满足预测率约束（如群体公平性约束）的同时最小化模型误差。然而，这些约束引入了样本间的依赖性，使得标准的差分隐私优化技术（如DP-SGD）无法直接应用。

Method: 论文开发了RaCO-DP方法，这是一种差分隐私下的随机梯度下降-上升（SGDA）算法，通过拉格朗日乘数法处理速率约束问题，并在每个优化步骤中通过私有化估计小批量的直方图来降低隐私成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在公平性与效用性的权衡上优于现有的隐私保护学习方法，并通过理论分析证明了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: RaCO-DP方法有效地解决了差分隐私下带约束的优化问题，为可信机器学习中的隐私保护与公平性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the
model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for
suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints
(demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such
constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP
optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability
into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample
dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we
develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA)
algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems.
We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these
constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at
each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a
novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual
parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness
constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private
learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led
to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for
training and inference. Existing kernels primarily optimize for compute
utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings.
However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch
overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many
applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive
applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for
accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language
models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, we observe
nontrivial speedups compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保形分类器虽然能提供概率保证，但常常产生过大且无信息量的预测集，影响了其实用性。

Method: 采用测试时增强（TTA）技术，结合不同的保形评分方法，无需重新训练模型，灵活且计算高效。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均减少预测集大小10%-14%，并在多种数据集、模型和分布偏移情况下验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 测试时增强是保形分类流程中的一种有用补充，能显著减少预测集大小并保持灵活性。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于价值感知的模型学习（如MuZero损失）在强化学习中被广泛应用，但缺乏对其理论优缺点的深入研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析其潜在问题并提出改进方案。

Method: 论文系统分析了价值感知模型学习损失函数家族，揭示了其作为未校准替代损失的本质问题，并提出了校准修正方法。同时研究了损失校准与随机/确定性模型架构、辅助损失的交互关系。

Result: 研究发现：1) 现有损失函数存在未校准问题；2) 确定性模型足以预测准确值函数；3) 学习校准后的随机模型仍具优势。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析揭示了价值感知损失的校准问题，提出的修正方法能恢复正确模型和值函数，同时阐明了模型架构选择与损失校准的权衡关系。

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate
value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared
to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent
empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its
strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of
value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We
show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses,
which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value
function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue.
Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent
model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when
training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be
sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is
still advantageous.

Motivation: 当前开放的机器学习模型生态系统存在供应链风险，如恶意模型替换、使用脆弱框架或受限/有毒数据训练模型，这些风险已被实际攻击利用。

Method: 探索如何利用Sigstore（一种为开源软件供应链提供透明度的解决方案）来增强开放ML模型的透明度，包括模型签名和数据集属性验证。

Result: Sigstore能够帮助模型发布者签名其模型并证明所用数据集的属性，从而降低供应链风险。

Conclusion: 通过Sigstore的应用，可以为开放ML模型生态系统提供更高的透明度和安全性，减少潜在风险。

Abstract: Powerful machine learning (ML) models are now readily available online, which
creates exciting possibilities for users who lack the deep technical expertise
or substantial computing resources needed to develop them. On the other hand,
this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that
the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain
risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include
an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a
model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted
or poisoned data. We then explore how Sigstore, a solution designed to bring
transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring
transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign
their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured
representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space.
In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as
dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that
autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold,
derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any
additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce
inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this
vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field
as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the
properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i)
analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even
throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's
parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii)
identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector
field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing
the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and
security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification.
A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'',
where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for
example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives
quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e.,
the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage
approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm,
struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements
to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved
branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an
order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that
our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously
infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation
methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Conclusion: CLUE提供了一种可微分、领域无关的校准方法，能与标准训练流程兼容，显著提升了神经网络不确定性估计的可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks
(NNs) in real-world applications. While existing calibration techniques often
rely on post-hoc adjustments or coarse-grained binning methods, they remain
limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains.
In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error
Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with
observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated
models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss.
CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance
and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies.
The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible
with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision,
regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and
domain-shift scenarios, we demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior calibration
quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art
approaches without imposing significant computational overhead.

Motivation: 此前研究表明模型架构、数据集大小和类别平衡影响分类器性能，但无法完全解释其表现差异。本文探讨数据集质量是否为独立于这些因素的固有属性。

Method: 通过创建数千个控制大小和类别平衡的数据集，并用多种架构（随机森林、支持向量机、深度网络等）训练分类器进行验证。

Result: 不同架构的分类器性能在数据集子集上呈现强相关性（R²=0.79），表明质量是数据集固有属性，且源于其构成类别的质量。

Conclusion: 数据集质量与大小、类别平衡和模型架构并列，成为优化机器学习分类性能的独立调控目标。

Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three
factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been
shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it.
Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be
referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a
joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic
property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and
independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the
same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other
factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each
controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a
wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to
deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by
subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic
property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model
architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an
emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'
constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model
architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target
for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have
recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of
leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex
optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased
volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However,
progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and
benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are
representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both
global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first
time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,
it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone
formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize
access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair
comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for
training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with
the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting
open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at
democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning
applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型被证明能显著增强对抗鲁棒性，但其内在机制尚不明确。现有直觉解释（如去噪净化）与实证现象存在矛盾，需系统性探究。

Method: 1) 观察扩散净化后样本与干净样本的ℓp距离变化 2) 分析模型内部随机性对净化结果的影响 3) 在固定随机性条件下重新评估鲁棒性 4) 建立压缩率与鲁棒性的关联分析

Result: 1) 净化后样本ℓp距离反而增大 2) 固定随机性时CIFAR-10鲁棒性提升降至24%（原报告70%）3) 剩余鲁棒性与输入空间压缩能力强相关

Conclusion: 扩散模型的鲁棒性提升主要源于输入空间压缩效应，压缩率可作为无需梯度分析的鲁棒性指标，为开发更有效的对抗净化系统提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical
adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed,
the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve
adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly
increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean
samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to
the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily
influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression
effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this
observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the
improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than
prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining
robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the
input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator
without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights
into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance
for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

The model, utilizing a deep neural network, was trained and tested using
multiple scenarios with different dataset distributions. The model's
performance was assessed against unseen test data, and accuracy, precision, and
area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. THE SXI++ LNM outperformed the
state of the art in three use cases, achieving an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI:
0.98-1.00). The model demonstrated a precision of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.8-100.0)

Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling,
yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their
learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples
are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as
a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is
asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit
makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial
correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical
score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one
generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same
effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent
memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better
variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data
distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be
reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential
Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two
regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial
Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a
second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along
the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any
learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.
Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic
and MNIST datasets.

Result: 在Virtual Tools和PHYRE基准测试中，Causal-PIK优于现有方法，且与人类解题者相比仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: Causal-PIK在复杂任务中表现出色，即使对人类解题者极具挑战性的任务也能保持竞争力。

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics
make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to
iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects
in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We
find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging,
even for human problem-solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches
capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these
models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the
iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization
difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning
(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel
class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's
policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function
as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a
range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased
test-time compute. We release the code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数上下文随机线性优化（CSLO）研究未充分考虑由机器学习模型预测的不确定参数所引起的不等式约束问题。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出一种能够处理约束不确定性的新方法。

Method: 本文引入了SPO-RC损失函数，这是一种对预测目标参数决策误差进行测量的可行性敏感适应方法。同时，提出了一个凸代理SPO-RC+，并证明了其与SPO-RC的Fisher一致性。此外，通过截断数据集和重要性重加权技术来纠正样本选择偏差。

Result: 在分数背包和合金生产问题的实例实验中，SPO-RC+有效地处理了约束中的不确定性，并且结合截断和重要性重加权技术进一步提高了性能。

Conclusion: SPO-RC+方法在处理约束不确定性方面表现出色，结合截断和重要性重加权技术可以进一步提升性能，为相关领域的研究和应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO)
that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality
constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning
model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets
constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual
uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with
Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the
SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We
also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with
SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true
constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the
induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through
experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we
demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and
that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve
performance.

Motivation: 先前的研究指出FTRL框架在动态环境中由于产生“懒惰”迭代而存在局限性。本文旨在展示FTRL通过适当调整可以克服这些限制，并在动态环境中表现出色。

Method: 论文通过乐观组合未来成本和谨慎线性化过去成本，提出了一种新的FTRL分析方法，允许在贪婪和敏捷更新之间进行插值，并应用最小递归正则化。

Result: 研究表明，FTRL能够恢复已知的动态遗憾边界，提供对遗憾项的精细控制，无需循环依赖的乐观性，并展示了状态与迭代同步的重要性。

Conclusion: FTRL框架在动态环境中的性能瓶颈并非源于其懒惰投影风格，而是算法状态与迭代解耦导致的状态无限增长。通过修剪实现同步可以解决这一问题。

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic
regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in
dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However,
building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we
show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic
composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can
lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic
comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile
updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret
terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal
recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not
the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but
the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,
allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two
when necessary.

Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing
and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to
scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position
paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its
application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally
accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise
scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal
definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core
values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of
essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing
parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and
finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element
Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM
with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how
DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for
computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics
consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI
paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and
developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational
science.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于非结构化稀疏性的KV缓存压缩方法，能在不损失精度的情况下实现高达70%的稀疏度，并通过定制注意力内核显著提升解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存大小是解码性能的主要瓶颈，尤其是在处理长上下文时内存开销巨大。现有结构化剪枝方案效果有限，因此探索非结构化稀疏性以提升压缩效率。

Method: 采用基于token幅度的剪枝策略对Key和Value缓存进行非结构化稀疏化，设计位图稀疏格式和定制注意力内核直接处理压缩后的缓存。

Result: 方法将KV缓存压缩至稠密推理的45%，上下文长度和吞吐量分别提升2.23倍，且无需微调即可保持精度。

Conclusion: 非结构化稀疏性可高效压缩KV缓存，定制硬件协同设计能有效抵消运行时剪枝开销，为LLM推理加速提供新方向。

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache
compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising
accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of
pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly
effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing
prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier
elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple
magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the
major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large
context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a
custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over
compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly
accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby
compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom
attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial
compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer
context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to
dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available
at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过参数或内存高效方法提升大语言模型预训练效率，同时保持与全模型训练相当的性能。作者综述了现有高效预训练方法，评估了多种代表性技术，并提出了两种实用技术以提升低秩方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的参数规模快速增长，导致训练和微调所需的计算资源急剧增加。尽管已有方法（如LoRA）能有效支持微调，但预训练阶段的高效性仍面临挑战，尤其是需要学习海量数据时。论文旨在解决如何通过高效方法提升预训练效率并缩小性能差距的问题。

Method: 论文首先综述了高效预训练的最新方法，随后对多种内存高效预训练方法进行基准评估，并提出了两种技术：权重重构（weight refactorization）和动量重置（momentum reset），以优化低秩方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，在优化器和超参数选择适当时，全秩训练性能最佳。同时，低秩方法中引入高秩更新是提升性能的关键。作者提出的技术在1B模型上实现了比GaLore和Fira等流行方法更低的困惑度（perplexity），同时减少约25%的内存使用。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计低秩方法（如结合高秩更新）并应用权重重构与动量重置技术，可在显著降低内存占用的同时，实现与全模型训练相当甚至更优的预训练性能。

Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple
domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with
some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is
accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the
memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous
approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While
these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training
is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.
Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can
parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while
achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the
performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are
the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that
summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform
a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training
approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We
observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank
training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that
incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving
their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely
weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of
efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to
the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular
memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using
about 25% less memory.

<details>

Motivation: 当前图扩散模型普遍依赖显式噪声条件化，但研究者质疑其必要性，探索是否可通过图结构本身隐式编码噪声信息以简化模型。

Method: 建立基于伯努利边翻转损坏的理论框架，扩展至结构-属性耦合噪声场景，并在合成与真实图数据上使用GDSS、DiGress等模型进行验证。

Result: 无条件GDMs性能媲美或优于有条件版本，参数量减少4-6%，计算时间降低8-10%，证明图数据高维特性可自编码足够去噪信息。

Conclusion: 图数据自身的高维特性可替代显式噪声条件化，为设计更简单高效的图扩散模型架构提供了新思路。

Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the
effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we
challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly
infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially
eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a
theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it
to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute
noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph
datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our
theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance
comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering
reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results
suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes
sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler,
more efficient GDM architectures.

Motivation: 尽管存在许多有效的DAG编码器，但由于DAG节点可以有多种拓扑顺序，如何以原则性的方式解码DAG仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于语法的方法，将DAG视为在明确语法上的推导，从而将DAG对应于唯一的产生式规则序列。

Result: 这种方法可以视为数据的无损压缩，并可用于图生成、属性预测的潜在空间学习以及结构化数据的贝叶斯优化。

Conclusion: 通过将DAG转换为唯一的序列表示，该方法为DAG的解码和应用提供了一种原则性和紧凑的解决方案。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.

Conclusion: 安全约束图演化为构建鲁棒、可解释的智能推理系统提供了可扩展的模块化基础。

Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow
generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to
unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework
that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph
evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable
intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable
graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e.,
crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness
while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a
high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task
settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements
in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent
reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that
safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for
robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Conclusion: EquiReg通过流形对齐的正则化机制，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的重建质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems
such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based
inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling
process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However,
due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on
isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data
manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose
Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for
regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.
EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and
penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new
distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that
exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold
samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling
process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image
restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: K-means聚类算法可能在敏感变量（如性别或种族）上存在不公平性，导致某些子群在聚类中比例失衡，进而引发偏见和社会问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化方法：先进行聚类，然后调整选定数据点的聚类成员身份。提出了两种高效算法，分别关注聚类外的最近数据点和高度'混合'的数据点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，公平性得到显著提升，且对聚类质量的影响极小。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能有效提升K-means聚类的公平性，并可轻松扩展到其他聚类算法或公平性指标。

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major
weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have
disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in
terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue
may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to
improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization
formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small
subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are
proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with
one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on
highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial
improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The
proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering
algorithms or fairness metrics.

reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is
designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor
signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To
train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that
transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight
reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while
significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier
requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared
to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest
that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and
energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.

*Albert Tseng,Zhaofeng Sun,Christopher De Sa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: YAQA是一种新型的后训练量化算法，通过使用Kronecker分解近似全模型Hessian矩阵，显著降低了量化模型与原模型的KL散度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM后训练量化算法通常独立最小化线性层的即时激活误差，忽略了后续层的影响，导致量化模型与原模型输出分布不一致。

Method: YAQA采用Kronecker分解近似每层线性层关于全模型KL散度的Hessian矩阵，并开发了一种与量化器无关的舍入算法。

Result: 实验表明，YAQA在各种模型和量化器上能将KL散度降低约30%，并在下游任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: YAQA通过全局优化量化过程，显著提升了量化模型的输出分布保真度和任务性能。

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed
model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as
possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear
layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However,
this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing
it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet
Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses
Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect
to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components:
Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably
computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent
rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical
guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically
reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while
achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正则化k-means算法，用于确定未标记数据集中有意义的聚类数量，并分析了加性和乘性正则化方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无标签数据集中找到有意义的聚类数量是许多应用中的重要问题。当前缺乏对关键超参数λ设置的原则性指导，且k-means算法在加性正则化下常产生多解问题。

Method: 通过假设理想聚类（定义为具有相同半径的d维球体），推导出λ的严格边界，并分析了加性和乘性正则化k-means算法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，加性正则化k-means常产生多解，而乘性正则化与加性正则化的共识能在某些情况下减少多解歧义。此外，展示了算法在偏离理想假设时的性能表现。

Conclusion: 正则化k-means算法在理想聚类假设下表现良好，加性和乘性正则化的结合能有效减少多解问题，但在实际应用中需考虑聚类偏离理想假设的情况。

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Conclusion: 权重在低维流形上的调制为多任务学习提供了更有效且可解释的新范式。

Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as
possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this
is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by
injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters
themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as
serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn
weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.
Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we
optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To
accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as
the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric
movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects
a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for
a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.
First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a
convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.
Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging
generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several
topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.
noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their
simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks
by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.
These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds
offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Motivation: 现有基准难以捕捉现实世界讨价还价的复杂性，大语言模型在战略深度和人类因素适应方面存在局限，需改进其谈判策略与人类偏好的一致性。

Method: 提出三部分框架：(1) BargainArena多场景基准数据集；(2) 基于效用理论的评估指标；(3) 结构化反馈机制结合情境学习提示，迭代优化模型策略。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型的谈判策略常偏离人类偏好，而结构化反馈机制显著提升其表现，增强战略深度和对手感知推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LLMs在复杂谈判中的适应性挑战，通过效用反馈和OAR促进，推动了更符合人类偏好的谈判策略生成。

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges
for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and
adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture
this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in
realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on
utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a
novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

Conclusion: HYDRO框架有效解决了离线鲁棒RL中的数据不足和模拟器动态不匹配问题，展示了其在样本效率上的优势。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these
challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount
of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and
minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in
the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized
sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing
methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample
efficiency in offline robust RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP视觉编码器存在固定输入分辨率和无法区分不相似图像嵌入的局限性，替换它通常需要高昂的计算成本。

Method: 提出QLIP，基于图像四叉树的内容感知分块方法，替代CLIP视觉编码器，无缝集成现有MLLMs。

Result: QLIP提升了LLaVA v1.5系列模型的视觉问答准确率，在V*基准上详细理解性能提升高达13.6%。

Conclusion: QLIP是一种高效且无需重新训练的CLIP替代方案，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens,
aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate
crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted
foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical
role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision
encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only
handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings
for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model
typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often
necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the
CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these
issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance
both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training.
QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform
grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental
results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering
accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without
requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts
detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by
up to 13.6 percent.

Motivation: 现有TTS基准测试难以全面评估模型对语义复杂文本的处理能力，因此需要一个新的、更全面的评估框架。

Method: 基于EmergentTTS，通过LLM扩展人工种子提示，生成1,645个多样化测试用例，并利用大型音频语言模型（LALM）自动评估语音质量。

Result: 评估显示，模型即评委的方法能有效揭示TTS系统的细粒度性能差异，并与人类偏好高度相关。

Conclusion: EmergentTTS-Eval提供了一个可扩展的自动化评估框架，能够全面评估TTS模型在复杂场景下的表现。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle
nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we
introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six
challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic
complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions.
Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation,
making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of
human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target
specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645
diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a
Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple
dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation
accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems,
such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval,
demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences.
Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment
and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation

Motivation: 近年来大语言模型的推理能力快速提升，研究者希望找到更基础的方法来可靠地增强其泛化能力。

Method: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数来控制模型复杂度，并比较不同复杂度超参数下预训练2.4B模型在1T tokens上的性能。

Result: 研究发现，保持恒定的初始化率（标准差指数）能使扩展规律在模型和数据规模上更快下降，复杂度控制显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 复杂度控制是大语言模型持续进步的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly
advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches
that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that
model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the
initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of
LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further
illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on
1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the
initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent
of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.
These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the
continual advancement of LLMs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the
topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a
spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological
features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a
dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular
solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors
describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any
moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the
basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message
passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics
about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with
spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing
enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to
approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also
significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse
graph tasks.

Conclusion: $K^2$VAE通过线性化处理和不确定性建模，有效减少了长期预测中的误差累积，为概率时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,
providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统过于关注吞吐量，忽视了TTFT和TPOT等SLO指标，导致SLO达标率不佳。

Conclusion: SCORPIO通过利用SLO异构性进行自适应调度，显著提升了LLM服务系统的性能和SLO达标率。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum
throughput. They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to
First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal
SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving
system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads
with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for
adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch
selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first
reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes
a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both
guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that
SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5%
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language
representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for
adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt
learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains
underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral
differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning
(VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain
shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{}
and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and
prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL).
Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex
scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both
prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical
insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to
the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of
foundation models across various domains. In this study, we evaluate the
efficacy of Large EEG Models (LEMs) by fine-tuning LaBraM, a state-of-the-art
foundation EEG model, on a real-world stress classification dataset collected
in a graduate classroom. Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs
using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their
applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that
distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG
data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The
best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a
5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of
the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.
These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process
real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize
brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric
to data-centric design.

TL;DR: ProDiff提出了一种仅需轨迹两端点即可补全缺失轨迹的新框架，结合原型学习和扩散模型，显著提升了补全精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹补全方法依赖稀疏轨迹或速度等信息，假设稀疏数据保留关键行为模式，对数据采集要求高且未充分利用大规模轨迹嵌入的潜力。

Method: 提出ProDiff框架：1) 通过原型学习嵌入人类移动模式；2) 使用去噪扩散概率模型进行时空重建；3) 定制损失函数进行联合训练。

Conclusion: ProDiff以最小端点信息实现高效轨迹补全，验证了原型学习和扩散模型在轨迹重建中的有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from
incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios.
Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information,
such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume
that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place
significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of
large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a
trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal
information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns
and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal
reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective
imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by
6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927
correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DenoiseRotator的新方法，通过重新分配参数重要性来增强大语言模型剪枝的鲁棒性，显著减少了性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要关注单个权重的重要性估计，限制了保留模型关键能力的效果，尤其是在半结构化稀疏约束下性能下降明显。

Method: 提出DenoiseRotator方法，通过学习正交变换重新分配权重矩阵的重要性，最小化归一化重要性分数的信息熵，使模型更易于剪枝。

Result: 在LLaMA3、Qwen2.5和Mistral模型上，DenoiseRotator在50%非结构化和2:4半结构化稀疏条件下，持续改进了困惑度和零样本准确率。例如，在LLaMA3-70B上，困惑度差距减少了58%。

Conclusion: DenoiseRotator是一种模型无关的方法，可无缝集成现有剪枝技术，显著提升剪枝后的模型性能。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are
available at https://github.com/Axel-gu/DenoiseRotator.

TL;DR: CDR-Agent是一种基于LLM的系统，旨在通过自主识别和应用临床决策规则(CDRs)来提升急诊科决策效率，减少不必要的干预并提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急诊科的临床决策复杂且快速，临床决策规则(CDRs)的使用常因医生的认知负荷而受限。本文旨在通过开发CDR-Agent系统来优化这一过程。

Method: 开发了CDR-Agent系统，基于LLM技术，利用非结构化临床笔记自主识别和应用CDRs。通过合成和CDR-Bench两个数据集验证其有效性。

Result: CDR-Agent在CDR选择上比基线LLM提高了56.3%（合成数据集）和8.7%（CDR-Bench数据集）的准确率，显著降低了计算开销，并在影像决策中表现出色。

Conclusion: CDR-Agent能高效选择相关CDRs，并在减少不必要干预的同时成功识别多数阳性病例，优于传统LLM提示方法。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly
in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions
are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools
that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to
make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the
clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply
the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system
designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying
the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate
CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although
CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\%
(synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM
baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces
computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent
not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective
imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully
identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM
prompting approaches. Code for our work can be found at:

TL;DR: 扩散LLM虽高效但无法保证约束满足，DINGO提出动态规划约束解码方法，在JSON生成等任务中提升68%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散LLM无法可靠满足用户指定的形式约束（如正则表达式），限制了其在结构化输出任务（如固定模式JSON生成）中的应用。

Method: 提出DINGO方法，基于动态规划的约束解码策略，既能高效运行，又能保持输出分布的真实性。

Result: 在符号数学和JSON生成基准测试中，DINGO比无约束推理提高了68个百分点。

Conclusion: DINGO为扩散LLM提供了一种有效的约束解码方案，使其在需要结构化输出的任务中更加可靠。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional
autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime
efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably
enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which
makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as
fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This
parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are
designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true
output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic
programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and
provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with
the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while
strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic
math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point
improvement over unconstrained inference

TL;DR: 论文提出CompFlow方法，通过流匹配与最优传输理论解决源与目标环境动态差异问题，提升强化学习样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理源与目标环境动态差异时，常依赖KL散度或互信息，但这些指标在动态分布不重叠时可能失效。

Method: CompFlow将目标动态建模为基于源域流输出分布的条件流，利用Wasserstein距离量化动态差异，并设计主动数据收集策略。

Result: 实验表明，CompFlow在动态偏移的RL基准测试中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CompFlow通过理论驱动的动态差异估计和主动探索，有效缩小了与最优策略的性能差距。

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在农业病害分类中存在数据隐私问题，而集中式联邦学习易受单点故障和扩展性限制。本文旨在解决这些挑战，实现隐私保护的农业应用。

Method: 采用去中心化联邦学习框架（DFL），利用验证损失（Loss_val）指导模型共享，并通过加权参数控制的自适应损失函数校正本地训练。实验使用了PlantVillage数据集和三种深度学习架构（ResNet50、VGG16和ViT_B16）。

Result: 实验结果表明，DFL框架不仅提高了准确性和收敛速度，还在异构数据环境中表现出更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DFL框架特别适合隐私保护的农业应用，为农作物病害检测提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in
agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and
environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT
have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images,
their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns.
Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains
vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses
validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to
correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting
parameter. We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with
three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the
impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of
clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients. Results
demonstrate that our DFL approach not only improves accuracy and convergence
speed, but also ensures better generalization and robustness across
heterogeneous data environments making it particularly well-suited for
privacy-preserving agricultural applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出BOGC-MML方法，通过贝叶斯导向的梯度校准解决多模态学习中梯度不确定性问题，提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法采用固定权重聚合梯度，忽视各模态梯度的内在不确定性，导致敏感维度过度更新或非敏感维度更新不足，影响性能。

Method: BOGC-MML将各模态梯度建模为随机变量，推导其概率分布；通过精度量化梯度置信度，利用Dempster-Shafer规则融合不确定性，生成校准后的更新方向。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了该方法能有效平衡梯度敏感性与保守性，显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: BOGC-MML通过显式建模梯度不确定性，为多模态学习提供了更鲁棒的优化方向。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to
improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate
gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the
intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive
updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient
updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this
issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for
MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model
optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each
modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability
distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we
propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of
each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the
confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,
we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced
Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a
calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across
dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining LSTM (Long Short-Term

(CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and
RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales.
  Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the
strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to
individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study
highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and
provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.

Conclusion: EST不仅能够覆盖张量积的函数空间，还表现出更优的表达能力和等变性，为分子系统建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their
message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are
limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations,
thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular
benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的微调计算成本高昂，阻碍了广泛应用。现有的参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）在方向调整上缺乏严格的几何基础，限制了其灵活性和可解释性。

Method: MAP框架将预训练权重归一化，学习方向性更新，并引入两个标量系数独立调整基础和更新向量的大小，从而实现了更灵活和可解释的权重调整。

Result: 实验表明，MAP与现有方法结合时显著提升了性能，为PEFT方法提供了简单而强大的增强。

Conclusion: MAP因其普适性和简洁性，有望成为未来PEFT方法设计的默认设置。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

Conclusion: RL-AVNS方法在复杂物流场景中具有实际应用价值，能够有效解决多时间窗车辆路径问题，并在泛化性和求解效率上表现优异。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive variable
neighborhood search (RL-AVNS) method designed for effectively solving the
Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows (VRPMTW). Unlike traditional
adaptive approaches that rely solely on historical operator performance, our
method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select
neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned
experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal
flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural
policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local
search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic
scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines,
characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate
that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search
(VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics,
achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational
efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities.
Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to
problem instances not encountered during training, underscoring its practical
utility for complex logistics scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models
incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces
low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the
structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through
singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly
amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact,
suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional
subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are
reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace
remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that
leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise
modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global
structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines
across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有ML数据中心在加速器故障时需将任务迁移至整台备用机架，导致资源浪费。传统电互连机架在替换故障GPU后带宽受限。

Method: 提出LUMION光互连架构，通过动态整合备用加速器到运行中的工作负载，实现秒级故障恢复，并构建端到端硬件原型验证。

Result: 实验显示LUMION能在1秒内完成GPU替换，故障后带宽高于传统电互连机架，使Llama 3.2微调吞吐量提升近2倍。

Conclusion: LUMION通过光互连和动态资源整合，显著提升数据中心加速器容错效率和训练性能。

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the
affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach,
while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring
datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In
this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a
novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a
datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically
integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby
maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the
benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our
experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a
healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION
achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks
after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X
improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

*Ning Liu,Yue Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型神经算子架构NIPS，通过线性注意力机制和可学习核网络提升物理系统建模的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制在AI核心领域如自然语言处理和计算机视觉中表现突出，但其在复杂物理系统建模中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。学习此类系统通常需要从有限的函数对实例中发现算子，这是一个严重不适定的逆PDE问题。

Method: NIPS基于并改进了非局部注意力算子（NAO），采用线性注意力机制实现可扩展学习，并集成可学习核网络作为傅里叶空间中的通道独立卷积，从而避免显式计算和存储大规模成对交互。

Result: 实验表明，NIPS在多个基准测试中一致优于NAO和其他基线方法，显著提升了物理学习的可扩展性、可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: NIPS在物理系统建模中实现了显著的性能提升，为可扩展、可解释且高效的物理学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

*Pengfei Zhou,Yunlong Liu,Junli Liang,Qi Song,Xiangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出CrossLinear模型，通过交叉相关嵌入模块有效区分内外生变量，提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型难以区分内外生变量，导致效率低下和过拟合，需新方法解决依赖建模问题。

Method: CrossLinear结合轻量级交叉相关嵌入模块和全局线性头，捕捉变量间静态直接依赖，忽略动态间接依赖。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上验证，CrossLinear在长短期预测中表现优异，消融实验证实模块有效性。

Conclusion: CrossLinear通过创新模块提升预测精度，其通用性使其适用于多领域预测任务。

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging
paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between
variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between
endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting.
In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model
that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play
cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the
dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly
integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures
time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying
or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in
dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements.
Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head
to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies,
further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12
real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance
in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study
underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.
Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in
for various forecasting tasks across different domains. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM)方法，通过奇异值分解对齐权重矩阵，实现高效多任务模型融合，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法假设权重矩阵相同位置的条目功能相同，但忽略了微调后神经网络的复杂性，导致直接条目合并存在问题。

Method: DRM利用奇异值分解分解和协调权重矩阵到对齐的联合空间，使条目合并成为可能，并通过重归一化增强性能。

Result: 实验表明，DRM在ViT、DeBERTa、T5和Llama3.1-8B等多种模型上优于现有融合技术，尤其在完全微调和低秩适应设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: DRM通过分解和重归一化创建稳健的对齐空间，显著提升模型融合效果，重归一化是其性能的关键因素。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for
creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to
be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional
multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at
identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling
straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption
overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may
develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging
problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective
approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and
coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise
merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various
settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,
encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.
Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art
merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.
Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for
creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing
to the method's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法存在三个主要问题：依赖批量同步系统导致设备利用率低、缺乏对底层系统调度机制的了解、过度依赖强化学习而忽略专家设计的启发式方法。

Method: 提出Doppler框架，包含三个阶段，训练双策略网络：SEL策略选择操作，PLC策略将操作分配到设备。

Result: 实验表明，Doppler在所有任务中均优于基线方法，减少了系统执行时间，并提高了采样效率。

Conclusion: Doppler通过结合双策略网络，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了调度效率和性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices
to minimize execution time in a work-conserving system, with emphasis on
complex machine learning workloads. Prior learning-based methods often struggle
due to three key limitations: (1) reliance on bulk-synchronous systems like
TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2)
lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when
designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement
learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts.
In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for
training dual-policy networks consisting of 1) a $\mathsf{SEL}$ policy for
selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen
operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms
all baseline methods across tasks by reducing system execution time and
additionally demonstrates sampling efficiency by reducing per-episode training
time.

*Zhe Ye,Zhengxu Yan,Jingxuan He,Timothe Kasriel,Kaiyu Yang,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Verina基准，用于评估可验证代码生成，发现当前大语言模型在生成正确代码、规范和证明方面仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在软件开发中的应用日益增多，但确保其生成代码的正确性仍具挑战性，通常需要昂贵的人工审查。可验证代码生成（同时生成代码、规范和代码规范对齐的证明）为解决这一问题提供了可能，但目前缺乏支持端到端可验证代码生成的评估基准。

Method: 论文介绍了Verina（Verifiable Code Generation Arena），一个高质量的基准测试集，包含189个手动整理的Lean编程任务，每个任务包含详细的问题描述、参考实现、形式化规范和广泛的测试套件。Verina支持对代码、规范和证明生成及其组合进行全面和模块化的评估。

Result: 对当前最先进的大语言模型进行的广泛评估显示，可验证代码生成面临显著挑战，特别是在证明生成方面。表现最佳的模型OpenAI o4-mini在每任务一次尝试下，仅生成61.4%的正确代码、51.0%健全且完整的规范，以及3.6%的成功证明。

Conclusion: Verina基准的引入旨在推动可验证代码生成领域的进步，通过提供一个严格且全面的评估标准。论文发布了数据集和评估代码，希望促进相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software
development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging
and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly
generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment --
offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs'
benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current
benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In
this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a
high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code,
specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina
consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem
descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive
test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof
generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in
verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4%
correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful
proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in
verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark.
We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过高容量价值模型和可学习任务嵌入来解决多任务强化学习中任务干扰问题的方法，在多个基准测试中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于价值的强化学习（RL）主要依赖小模型在单一任务上训练，而多任务RL由于稀疏奖励和梯度冲突导致优化困难。论文旨在解决这一问题，实现鲁棒且可扩展的多任务训练。

Method: 使用高容量价值模型，通过交叉熵训练并结合可学习的任务嵌入，以减少任务干扰并优化在线强化学习。

Result: 在7个多任务基准测试（包含280多个任务）中，该方法在单任务和多任务性能上均达到最优，并实现了高效的样本迁移。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够显著提升多任务强化学习的性能，为通用策略的训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large
models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in
value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by
small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL
sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference
brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online
training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of
single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of
high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on
learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online
RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach
on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high
degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that,
despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single
and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LUCB-H算法，解决带有偏差离线数据的最佳臂识别问题，通过自适应置信区间和偏差校正，在理论和实验中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景（如临床试验）中，离线数据可能存在偏差，而现有自适应算法在未知偏差界限时无法有效利用这些数据。

Method: 提出LUCB-H算法，在LUCB框架中引入辅助偏差校正，自适应平衡离线和在线数据。

Result: 理论证明LUCB-H在离线数据误导时与标准LUCB样本复杂度相当，在数据有用时显著更优；实验验证了其鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: LUCB-H能有效整合偏差离线数据，部分场景下达到理论下界，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in
real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result
for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between
online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H
algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an
auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB
framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity
of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms
it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower
bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in
effectively incorporating offline data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出PMDG框架，通过风格迁移和数据增强从单源域生成伪多源域，使MDG算法适用于单源域泛化场景，实验表明伪域性能可媲美真实多域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据分布变化导致深度学习模型性能下降，多源域泛化(MDG)因构建多域数据集成本高而受限，需解决单源域泛化(SDG)的实用性问题。

Method: 提出伪多源域泛化(PMDG)，利用风格迁移和数据增强技术将单源域转化为伪多域数据集，适配现有MDG算法，并开发PseudoDomainBed基准进行验证。

Result: 实验发现MDG与PMDG性能呈正相关，充足数据下伪域性能可匹配或超越真实多域，为域泛化研究提供新见解。

Conclusion: PMDG框架有效降低了MDG的应用门槛，通过合成伪域实现接近真实多域的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提高联邦学习的训练效率，现有研究采用低秩分解技术减少通信开销，但分解方法的性能仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出三种技术：模型更新分解（MUD）、块状克罗内克分解（BKD）和聚合感知分解（AAD），分别解决分解中的三个关键问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比基线方法收敛更快且精度更高，理论分析也验证了MUD的收敛性。

Conclusion: 三种互补技术可同时应用，显著提升联邦学习中低秩分解方法的性能。

Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous
research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication
overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank
decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to
decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate.
Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition
(MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware
Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are
complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance.
Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the
convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our
approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant
baseline methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对时间序列分类任务的频率域增强方法FreRA，通过分离关键与非关键频率成分来改进对比学习，实验证明其在多项任务中优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列对比学习中的增强策略多源自视觉领域，可能因模态不匹配破坏时间序列的语义信息，需设计更适配的增强方法。

Method: 提出FreRA方法：从频率域自动分离关键/非关键频率成分，分别进行语义保护的身份修改和自适应修改，可即插即用集成到对比学习框架。

Result: 在UCR/UEA等7个数据集上验证，FreRA在分类、异常检测和迁移学习任务中均优于10个基线方法，尤其在迁移学习中展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 频率域增强能有效保留时间序列语义信息，FreRA为对比学习提供了轻量高效的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FSL-SAGE算法，结合联邦学习和分割学习的优势，通过辅助模型估计服务器梯度反馈，降低通信成本和客户端内存需求，同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习(FL)要求客户端能训练完整模型，不适用于大规模模型；分割学习(SL)虽减轻客户端内存压力，但因其顺序性增加了网络延迟。现有方法缺乏服务器反馈且可能影响精度，因此需要一种兼顾效率和准确性的新方法。

Method: 提出FSL-SAGE算法，利用辅助模型周期性模拟服务器行为，估计服务器端梯度反馈，实现并行客户端训练。

Result: FSL-SAGE达到与FedAvg相同的收敛速度O(1/√T)，显著降低通信成本和内存需求，并在实验中优于现有FSL方法。

Conclusion: FSL-SAGE有效平衡了通信效率与模型精度，为分布式机器学习提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split
Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data.
However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for
large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory
constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases
network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the
conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to
improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor
accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation
Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates
server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models
periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that
FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while
significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our
empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL
methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出RadarGate，一种基于几何旋转的新型门控机制，用于提升LoRA混合专家模型的表达能力和可扩展性，解决了传统加权和方法导致的泛化不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统门控机制通过加权和路由输入到最佳专家，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展性，导致泛化能力差和欠拟合问题。根本原因在于现有加权和机制的表达能力受限。

Method: 提出RadarGate，通过可学习的旋转矩阵增强LoRA表示之间的交互，引入相对角度关系作为额外自由度，促进跨LoRA协同学习。

Conclusion: RadarGate通过几何旋转机制显著提升了LoRA模型的可扩展性，为解决大规模语言模型适应性问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates
large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However,
traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may
fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and
underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted
expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the
convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a
novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational
operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate
richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.
Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a
learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix
involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship
between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an
extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and
properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues
as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks
across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We
also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of
representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically
similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing
distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

Method: 提出IM-MPNN架构：通过分层图粗化实现多尺度消息传递，无需增加网络深度或参数量即可增强长程交互能力。

Conclusion: IM-MPNN通过多尺度消息传递机制成功突破了传统MPNN的局限性，为图神经网络的长程建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for
processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is
often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range
dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the
MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive
Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical
receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and
theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired
by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved
Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address
these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of
the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and
facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or
parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the
Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA层中矩阵通常初始化为零，但缺乏理论支持。本文探讨非零初始化的影响。

Method: 从无限宽度角度分析非零初始化对LoRA微调动态的影响，并进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 非零初始化提高了LoRA对次优学习率的鲁棒性，且不损害微调性能。

Conclusion: 微调无需严格从预训练模型开始，非零初始化是可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is
initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained
model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's
fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals
that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$
to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates,
particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the
non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained
weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words,
fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The
validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across
various models and datasets. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化剪枝方法，通过保留预训练模型的关键知识并微调更紧凑的参数空间，显著提升了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在零样本预测中表现优异，但在微调后仍无法稳定超越小型专用模型。论文旨在探索如何有效适应TSFMs以提升目标预测任务的性能。

Method: 通过结构化剪枝方法，保留预训练模型的关键知识，并在更相关和紧凑的参数空间中进行微调。

Result: 在七个TSFMs和六个基准测试上的实验表明，剪枝后的较小TSFMs在微调后显著提升了预测性能，甚至超越了专用基线模型。

Conclusion: “剪枝后微调”范式能够有效提升TSFMs的性能，使其在多种预测任务中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models
(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

*Xingyuan Pan,Chenlu Ye,Joseph Melkonian,Jiaqi W. Ma,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Daunce的数据归因方法，通过不确定性估计来识别训练数据对模型预测的影响，适用于大规模语言模型，并在准确性和可扩展性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于梯度的数据归因方法在大规模应用时受限，而随机投影方法虽提升了可扩展性，但准确性下降。论文通过探索不确定性与影响函数的关系，提出了一种更优的解决方案。

Method: Daunce方法通过微调一组扰动模型，并计算这些模型中每个样本损失的协方差作为归因分数，实现了高效且准确的数据归因。

Result: 实验证明，Daunce在视觉任务和大语言模型微调中表现优异，且适用于黑盒模型。在OpenAI的GPT模型上首次实现了专有大语言模型的数据归因。

Conclusion: Daunce是一种简单有效的数据归因方法，具有高可扩展性和准确性，适用于多种任务和模型类型，包括专有大语言模型。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training
examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By
quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data
debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on
gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale.
While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often
suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between
uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet
effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method
operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the
covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score.
Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate
attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks
ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its
compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our
method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on
proprietary LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨模型泛化能力与反事实解释性之间的内在联系，为量化评估过拟合提供新视角。

Method: 提出ε-有效反事实概率(ε-VCP)概念，通过理论分析决策边界几何性质与ε-VCP的关系，并结合实证验证。

Result: 发现ε-VCP随模型过拟合程度增加而上升，表明泛化能力差会降低生成反事实样本的难度。

Conclusion: 研究确立了泛化能力与反事实可解释性之间的严格权衡关系，ε-VCP可作为量化评估过拟合的实用指标。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between model generalization
and counterfactual explainability in supervised learning. We introduce the
notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) --
the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its
$\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a
theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the
model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase
with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between
poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an
inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability.
Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a
practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种创新方法，通过随机游走图和低秩分解优化特征与标签间的非线性关联，解决了多标签数据中特征与标签关系复杂和线性分解方法不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多标签数据集中，特征维度的快速增长可能导致特征与标签间的隐含关联，使关系变得复杂。现有方法通常采用低维线性分解，难以捕捉复杂的非线性关联，并可能导致特征空间与标签空间的不对齐。

Method: 论文设计了集成特征-特征、标签-标签和特征-标签关系的随机游走图，以准确捕捉非线性和隐含的间接关联，并通过低秩分解优化潜在表示。同时，利用低维表示系数对齐变量空间，并保留原始高维数据与低维表示空间之间的流形结构。

Conclusion: 该方法通过随机游走图和低秩分解优化，有效解决了多标签数据中特征与标签关系的复杂性和非线性关联问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations
between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships
between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods
often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations
between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture
complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature
space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose
innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates
feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately
capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the
latent representations of associations between features and labels after
low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging
low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold
structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the
low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets
using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨随机策略与确定性策略梯度在连续控制中的关系，以解决策略梯度方法的统一性问题。

Method: 分析高斯控制噪声和二次控制成本的MDP家族，构建等效确定性策略MDP，并比较不同梯度与价值函数。

Result: 证明在特定条件下随机与确定性策略梯度、自然梯度和状态价值函数相同，但状态-控制价值函数不同。

Conclusion: 通过近似状态价值函数而非状态-控制价值函数，可实现策略梯度方法的统一。

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic
and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In
a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic
control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,
natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the
state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general
procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent
to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the
sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results
suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state
value functions rather than state-control value functions.

*Honoka Anada,Tatsuya Kaneko,Shinya Takamaeda-Yamazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种去中心化联邦学习(DFL)中的参与者贡献评估方法：DFL-Shapley和DFL-MR，解决了现有方法仅适用于中心化联邦学习(CFL)的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的贡献评估方法仅适用于中心化联邦学习(CFL)，而DFL由于缺乏中央服务器和多全局模型的特点，使得这些方法难以直接应用。因此，需要开发专门针对DFL的贡献评估方法。

Method: 论文首先提出了DFL-Shapley，将Shapley值扩展到DFL环境；然后引入了DFL-MR，一种可计算的近似方法，通过累积轮次Shapley值来估计总体贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，DFL-Shapley是一个有效的基础真值指标，而DFL-MR在各种设置下都接近DFL-Shapley，证明了它们作为DFL贡献评估指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了适用于DFL的贡献评估方法，填补了现有技术的空白，为DFL系统的公平性和透明度提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is
crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various
methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed
exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server
collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their
contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which
clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained
significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating
a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement
methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and
the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies
for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley,
an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used
CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the
ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable
approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise
Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios
and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm
DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity
to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as
contribution metrics in DFL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过奖励调整加速RLHF训练的方法GRPOVI，通过增加奖励方差并保持偏好和期望不变，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在RLHF训练中效率不足，研究发现初始策略模型的奖励方差越高，训练速度越快，因此需要一种能有效增加奖励方差的方法。

Method: 提出了一种奖励调整模型，通过非凸优化问题增加奖励方差，并设计了O(n log n)算法求解全局最优解，将其集成到GRPO中形成GRPOVI算法。

Result: 实验表明，GRPOVI算法相比原始GRPO显著提升了RLHF训练效率，并间接解释了基于规则的奖励在GRPO中的有效性。

Conclusion: GRPOVI通过奖励方差优化有效加速了RLHF训练，为对齐人类偏好提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique
for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values
and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach,
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many
LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a
challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial
policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we
propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by
provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences
and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a
nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To
overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$
algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by
explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an
important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into
the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance
increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we
provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with
rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment
results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the
RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the
second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian
of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis.
However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by
applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box
method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is
time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually
resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data.
Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation
algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF,
respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with
time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the
approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in
likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior
accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms.
Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the
first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of
the general PF-ODE deduced map.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

covers, such as water bodies, crops, urban, etc. The constructed model was
subsequently applied within the study region, allowing for an effective
comparative evaluation of LULC changes within the given timeframe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高维环境下，确定随机变量之间的条件独立性（CI）关系是机器学习和统计学中的基础但具有挑战性的任务。现有的基于生成模型的CI测试方法（如使用生成对抗网络的方法）往往在条件分布建模和训练稳定性上表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于生成模型的CI测试提供了新的有效途径，具有精确的Type I错误控制、强大的测试能力和实际可解释性。

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random
variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and
statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative
model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial
networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional
distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To
address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based
generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong
testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching
scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics
conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type
I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method
to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We
theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by
score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a
promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving
serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model
development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple
accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are
larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow
Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more
domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be
extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our
methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower
serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary

within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric.
We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为GraphPAE的新型图自编码器，通过双路径架构同时重构节点特征和位置，以解决传统图自编码器仅能捕获低频信号的问题。实验证明GraphPAE在多个任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图自编码器（GAEs）主要通过掩码节点或边来预测缺失元素，但实验发现这种方法主要捕获图的低频信号，无法学习到丰富的结构信息。因此，作者提出GraphPAE以解决这一问题。

Method: GraphPAE采用双路径架构：特征路径利用位置编码增强消息传递处理，提高预测损坏信息的能力；位置路径利用节点表示优化位置并逼近特征向量，使编码器能学习多样化的频率信息。

Result: 在异质性节点分类、图属性预测和迁移学习等任务上的实验表明，GraphPAE取得了最先进的性能，并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphPAE通过双路径架构有效捕获图的多样频率信息，显著提升了图自监督学习的表现，为图表示学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations
without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders
(GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability.
Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements,
such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation
reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture
low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural
information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders
(GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node
features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding
to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict
the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node
representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby
enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including
heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer
learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art
performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出Sentinel框架，通过主动异常检测优化直播流调度，显著降低异常频率并提升收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着直播服务的快速增长，众包云边平台（CCPs）需求激增，但现有调度策略因平台不稳定和异常检测困难而难以实现优化。

Method: Sentinel采用两阶段调度范式：预调度阶段进行异常检测并构建策略池；后调度阶段根据请求触发预生成策略执行调度。

Result: 实验表明，Sentinel将异常频率降低70%，收益提升74%，调度速度翻倍。

Conclusion: Sentinel通过主动异常检测有效解决了CCPs调度中的关键挑战，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge
service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting
the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in
optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve
practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the
substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in
time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a
strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers
an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the
scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that
Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by
74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解决奖励不公平问题的方法，通过资源分配视角设计公平性正则化和公平性系数，有效缓解了奖励偏差对大型语言模型对齐的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励在基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中扮演重要角色，但它们可能存在各种偏差，影响大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐效果。本文将这些偏差统称为奖励不公平问题，旨在从资源分配角度提出一种通用解决方案。

Method: 将偏好学习建模为资源分配问题，提出公平性正则化（Fairness Regularization）和公平性系数（Fairness Coefficient）两种方法，在验证和强化学习场景中分别实现奖励公平性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够更公平地使LLM与人类偏好对齐，有效缓解多种奖励偏差问题。

Conclusion: 通过资源分配视角设计的公平性方法，无需针对特定偏差类型定制，即可有效提升奖励模型的公平性，从而改善LLM的对齐效果。

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards
are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect
the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively
define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward
unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward
fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing
for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model
preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as
resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and
fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization
and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods
in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness
reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these
scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a
more fair manner.

Conclusion: 交互式RL结合不完美种植者输入可提升RL代理性能，但需根据输入特性选择合适机制。动作选择类算法（如策略塑造和控制共享）更具优势。

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects
crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received
increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including
limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.
Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's
learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,
interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may
face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to
explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with
imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three
representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate
control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how
input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between
them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural
network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under
limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the
three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse
environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating
imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL
agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping
and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,
achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,
reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive
to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the
importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect
inputs.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in
speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are
commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally
expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a
production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and
explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance
models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using
pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large
longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting
time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly
associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning
approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional
mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest
performance.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We
evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full
interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing
two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic
and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Conclusion: 后处理OOD检测可有效替代缓冲区方案，为开放世界类增量学习系统提供了高效且隐私保护的设计思路。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测编码（PC）模型仅支持单向（生成或判别）推理，而实验证据表明大脑同时使用两种推理方式。单向模型在需要双向处理的任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更接近生物视觉推理的模型。

Method: 提出双向预测编码（bPC）模型，整合生成式和判别式推理，并设计同时适用于两种任务的能量景观。

Result: bPC在生成或判别任务中表现优于单向模型，并在多模态学习和信息缺失推理任务中展现出更优性能。

Conclusion: bPC更接近生物视觉推理机制，为理解大脑如何处理视觉信息提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual
learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down
generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and
inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that
PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict
neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence
suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,
while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring
bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC
model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while
maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC
matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or
discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously
suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two
biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with
missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference
more closely.

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational
strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to
enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end
warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of
fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of
deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account
capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize
(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align
prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer
satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task
Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes
product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer
satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs
a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal
inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking
model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a
post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh
platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO
method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances
the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and
narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These
findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at
front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable
insights for future research in this domain.

Conclusion: DACER2通过改进训练和推理效率，同时保持高性能，为扩散策略在实时在线强化学习中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise
in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy
Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse
diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy
gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost
of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training
efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance
degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant
bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To
improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing
performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary
optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step.
Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the
diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy.
To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the
model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine
actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and
several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five
diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to
DACER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是一种全球性的情绪障碍，现有研究多关注言语和非言语行为线索，而头部运动尚未得到充分研究。此外，单一数据集验证机器学习模型可能限制其泛化能力。

Method: 研究使用三种西方文化背景的抑郁症数据集（德国AVEC2013、澳大利亚Blackdog和美国Pitt），通过两种方法验证kineme模式的泛化性：(i) 单/多数据集的k折交叉验证，(ii) 模型在其他数据集上的重用。采用经典机器学习方法评估分类和回归性能。

Result: 头部运动模式是评估抑郁症严重程度的有效生物标志物，在分类和回归任务中表现优异，尤其在AVEC2013数据集中达到第二低的平均绝对误差（MAE）。kineme特征在二元严重程度分类中比原始头部运动描述符更具泛化性，在严重程度估计（回归）中也优于其他视觉行为线索。

Conclusion: 头部运动单元（kinemes）作为抑郁症严重程度评估的生物标志物具有高效性和良好的泛化能力，为跨文化和多场景的自动化抑郁症评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions
worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal
behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received
little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine
learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This
work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising
elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity
estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different
western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt
datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the
generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold
cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on
other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with
classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion
patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving
highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on
a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more
generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity
classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation
(regression).

Conclusion: 显式促进多样性的RL训练方法能有效提升LLM推理能力，证实了多样性对高性能模型的重要作用。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced
rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired
a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on
LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work
presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based
training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy
optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel
metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models.
This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL
training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it
into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples.
Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5
percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social
impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such
mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making
system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While
abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification
tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in
pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the
ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the
estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold:
a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a
model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models,
and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在多数据集和多模型上的实验表明，SPR正则化方法优于其他正则化方法，并能帮助KGC模型进一步突破性能边界。

Conclusion: 精心设计的正则化不仅能缓解过拟合和减少方差，还能使KGC模型突破原有性能上限，SPR方法在这方面表现出色。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Motivation: 传统战略分类研究主要集中于线性分类器，本文旨在扩展研究范围，探讨非线性分类器下的战略行为及其对学习的影响。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，分析非线性对决策边界点、分类器表达能力及模型复杂度的影响。

Result: 研究发现，通用逼近器在战略环境下失去通用性，实验表明这会导致性能差距。

Conclusion: 非线性分类器在战略分类中存在局限性，通用逼近器在战略环境下不再适用。

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is
extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly
feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning
supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification
has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to
expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under
non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up
approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier
expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal
approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment
is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps
even on an unrestricted model class.

Conclusion: 该框架为分布外检测和不确定性估计提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在数据性能之外的学习能力是其核心，但扩展性较差；而生成模型方法简单且易于扩展。论文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 通过建立策略改进与扩散模型引导之间的直接关系，提出CFGRL框架，利用监督学习的简单性训练，无需显式学习价值函数。

Result: 在离线强化学习任务中，增加引导权重可稳定提升性能，且CFGRL能泛化简单监督方法（如目标条件行为克隆），进一步提升整体性能。

Conclusion: CFGRL成功结合了生成模型的扩展性与强化学习的策略改进能力，为离线强化学习提供了一种高效且简单的解决方案。

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the
performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously
tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably
scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by
deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion
models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of
supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On
offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting
leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate
without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple
supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further
prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了联邦强化学习（FRL）中环境异质性对策略梯度方法收敛性的影响，提出了一种新的策略梯度方法b-RS-FedPG，并证明了其在异质环境下的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦强化学习中，环境异质性可能导致最优策略需要是非确定性或时变的。这一现象在表格环境中尤为明显，但目前缺乏有效的收敛性保证。

Method: 论文首先分析了异质性对策略梯度方法的影响，随后提出了基于局部更新的联邦策略梯度（FedPG）算法，并进一步引入了b-RS-FedPG方法，该方法结合了精心设计的softmax参数化和正则化方案。

Result: 理论分析表明，FedPG在代理数量上具有线性加速特性。实验证明，FedPG和b-RS-FedPG在异质环境下均优于联邦Q学习。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦强化学习中策略梯度方法的收敛性提供了理论保证，并提出了一种高效的新方法，适用于异质环境。

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement
learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In
this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively,
can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying,
even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results
for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under
a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both
entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical
analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of
agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights
from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient
method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization
coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate
explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary
policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG
consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于少量标注数据修复弱监督标注函数的方法，以提高标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序化弱监督（PWS）通过结合用户提供的标注函数（LFs）来减少人工标注的工作量，但其生成的标签质量直接依赖于LFs的准确性。因此，研究如何利用少量标注数据修复LFs具有重要意义。

Method: 论文开发了新技术，通过最小化修改LFs在标注数据上的结果来修复LFs，确保每个标注数据点有足够的正确标签证据，且修复后的LFs具有足够高的准确性。LFs被建模为条件规则，从而可以选择性地调整其输出。

Result: 实验表明，该系统能够基于极少量标注数据显著提高LFs的质量。

Conclusion: 通过少量标注数据修复LFs是可行的，且能有效提升弱监督学习的标签质量。

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for
labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions
(LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels
depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem
of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we
develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their
results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there
is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii)
the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as
conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change
their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system
improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled
datapoints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于热力学的视角来解释固定学习率下随机梯度下降（SGD）在神经网络训练中的稳态行为，揭示了学习率如何影响训练损失和权重分布熵的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解固定学习率下SGD在神经网络训练中的行为，特别是高学习率为何阻止训练收敛到损失最小值，以及不同学习率如何导致在不同损失水平上稳定。

Method: 通过热力学框架，将SGD的稳态行为解释为自由能最小化过程，其中自由能是训练损失和权重分布熵的平衡，温度由学习率决定。在欠参数化和过参数化模型上进行了实证验证。

Result: 欠参数化模型始终遵循自由能最小化，温度随学习率单调增加；而过参数化模型在低学习率下温度有效降至零，导致SGD直接最小化损失并收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 论文通过热力学框架为SGD的行为提供了新的解释，揭示了学习率对训练动态的影响，并指出欠参数化和过参数化模型在自由能最小化行为上的差异源于随机梯度在最优值附近的信噪比差异。

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural
network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function
$F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights
distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective
offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss
minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We
empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)
and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy
minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP
models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to
minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this
mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients
near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的学习环境常常伴随着噪声数据和多源认知不确定性，如多任务学习、分布偏移和不完善学习等。这些不确定性使得仅依靠训练数据难以准确预测测试数据的分布。

Method: 论文引入了一种原则性的认知误差定义，并提出了一个通用的、可分解的认知误差界限，能够分别归因于学习过程和环境的多个方面。

Result: 论文不仅提供了针对贝叶斯迁移学习和ε邻域内分布偏移的专用认知误差界限，还提出了一组相应的泛化界限，并通过合成实验验证了负迁移的新定义。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理多源认知不确定性提供了一种系统的方法，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

TL;DR: 当前基于二阶分布的方法未能充分捕捉认知不确定性的关键成分，特别是模型偏差。通过更细粒度的分类和模拟评估，揭示了高模型偏差会导致认知不确定性低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，许多监督学习方法试图通过二阶分布区分偶然和认知不确定性，但这些方法往往忽略了模型偏差这一关键成分，导致认知不确定性估计不准确。

Method: 采用更细粒度的认知不确定性分类，分析预测误差的偏差-方差分解，并通过模拟评估协议（涵盖程序和数据驱动的不确定性）验证现有方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，高模型偏差会导致认知不确定性被低估，现有二阶方法将偏差引起的错误模糊归为偶然不确定性，从而低估认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 只有在充分表征所有认知不确定性来源时，才能获得有意义的偶然不确定性估计。当前方法需改进以更全面捕捉认知不确定性。

Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have
been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components
of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of
model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of
epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the
classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be
decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a
simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty
due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate
that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.
Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model
bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and
common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur
bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting
epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric
estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty
are properly represented.

TL;DR: 提出AnchorAttention，一种差异感知的动态稀疏注意力机制，通过更细粒度的稀疏策略提升长上下文LLM的计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预填充阶段因自注意力的二次复杂度面临计算挑战，且局部信息匹配和块稀疏实现无法捕捉全局上下文，导致精度和效率不足。

Method: AnchorAttention包含三个核心组件：基于模式的锚点计算、差异感知的条纹稀疏识别，以及细粒度稀疏计算，通过离散KV位置加载最大化稀疏率。

Result: 在128k文本长度下，AnchorAttention实现1.44倍加速，同时保持更高召回率，显著降低计算时间。

Conclusion: AnchorAttention通过细粒度稀疏策略和全局上下文适应，在效率和准确性上优于现有方法，为长上下文LLM提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant
computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ
dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,
their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture
global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent
internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,
dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical
attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global
contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention
comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation},
leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set
of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe
Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the
anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a
stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation},
replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with
simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while
preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained
sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at
the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a
speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

TL;DR: 提出StragglAR算法，解决分布式机器学习中因慢节点导致的AllReduce同步延迟问题，显著提升训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式机器学习中，数据并行和张量并行依赖AllReduce同步梯度或激活值，但慢节点（straggler）会导致同步延迟，影响整体性能。

Method: StragglAR算法在慢节点延迟期间先在其余GPU上执行ReduceScatter，待慢节点到达同步屏障后，再通过新设计的集体算法完成AllReduce。

Result: 理论证明StragglAR在存在慢节点的大型GPU集群中比主流带宽高效AllReduce算法（如Ring）快2倍；8-GPU服务器实测性能提升22%。

Conclusion: StragglAR有效解决了慢节点引发的同步瓶颈，为分布式训练和推理提供了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for
training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to
synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce
algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the
synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this
challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates
distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers.
StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the
straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to
complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier.
StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient
AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent
stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22%
speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习模型如扩散模型和自回归变换器虽强大，但分别存在计算复杂和需要学习离散表示的缺点。归一化流（NFs）作为一种替代方案，既能高效计算似然和采样，又避免了这些问题，但其在强化学习中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在证明NFs的表达能力足够，并探索其在强化学习中的潜力。

Result: 该方法简化了算法流程，并在模仿学习、离线强化学习、目标条件强化学习和无监督强化学习中取得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: 归一化流在强化学习中具有显著潜力，其高效性和表达能力使其成为现有模型的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using
powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and
diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay
the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion
models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance
on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are
scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing
flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they
enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or
autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received
limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows
lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on
recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates
seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy
measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher
performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and
unsupervised RL.

Motivation: 研究动机在于评估机器学习模型在诊断轻度认知障碍和阿尔茨海默病时可能存在的年龄、种族和性别偏见，并探索有效的偏见缓解策略，以确保医疗诊断的公平性。

Method: 研究方法包括对多队列数据集中与年龄、种族和性别相关的偏见进行分析，评估不同公平性定义和指标的可靠性，并比较预处理、处理中和处理后偏见缓解策略的效果。此外，引入了一种新的复合指标来衡量公平性和性能之间的权衡。

Result: 研究结果显示存在与年龄和种族相关的偏见，但未观察到显著的性别偏见。不同的偏见缓解策略在不同敏感属性和子问题中表现出不同程度的改进，特别是在种族和性别方面，拒绝选项分类显著提高了公平性。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，阿尔茨海默病的神经病理学和风险因素的变化与人口统计学特征相关，这些因素影响了模型的公平性。通过适当的偏见缓解策略，可以显著提高模型的公平性，同时保持诊断性能。

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine
learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases
associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the
influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are
investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in
the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most
appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies
is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the
trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the
equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic
applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to
age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed
mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across
the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and
gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,
respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI
versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial
debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic
mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD
neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics,
influence model fairness.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine
learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into
low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used
in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we
propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our
approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps
subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input
subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled
distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the
Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the
similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive
learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of
SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the
generated contrastive pairs.

TL;DR: 提出tnLLM框架，利用大语言模型（LLM）结合领域信息预测张量网络结构，减少计算开销并提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前张量网络结构搜索（TN-SS）方法计算成本高且忽视领域信息，缺乏结构透明度。需要一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 提出tnLLM框架，通过领域感知提示管道指导LLM基于张量模态间关系推断结构，迭代优化目标函数并生成领域感知解释。

Result: 实验表明tnLLM以更少函数评估达到与SOTA相近的性能，且LLM提供的领域信息可加速传统方法的收敛。

Conclusion: tnLLM框架有效结合领域知识与LLM推理能力，为TN-SS问题提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

Conclusion: 自适应联邦LoRA策略通过理论和实践优化，有效提升了联邦微调的效率，尤其在异构环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the
number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately
overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data
heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,
particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the
convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and
communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for
federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without
requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an
adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client
resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we
formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the
LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock
convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to
approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to
state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SPO框架，通过段级优势估计平衡精细度与计算成本，提升大语言模型推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在优势估计粒度上存在两极化问题：词级方法（如PPO）信号精细但估计不准，轨迹级方法（如GRPO）信号粗糙导致信用分配不精确。

Method: SPO框架包含三个创新策略：灵活分段、精确段优势估计、基于概率掩码的段优化，并针对短/长思维链场景分别提出SPO-chain和SPO-tree变体。

Result: 在GSM8K上比PPO/GRPO提升6-12个百分点，在MATH500上比GRPO提升7-11个百分点，且显著降低蒙特卡洛估计成本。

Conclusion: SPO通过中间粒度优势估计有效平衡精度与效率，为语言模型强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列数据的潜在动态结构学习中存在局限性，如对比方法缺乏概率模型支持，生成方法需要显式网络映射。RP-GSSM旨在结合两者优势，提供更灵活且高效的学习框架。

Result: RP-GSSM在包括从视频中学习非线性随机动力学（含或不含背景干扰）的任务中表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: RP-GSSM作为一种基础模型，为多种下游应用提供了有效工具，其无监督学习能力和灵活性使其在时间序列数据分析中具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

Abstract: Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data
is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation
models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step
reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations.
We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time,

This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with
genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal
biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is
developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning,
guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On
biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction
- where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction,
BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong
single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities
and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological
traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables
deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from

<details>

Motivation: 尽管现有方法在整体预测精度上表现优异，但实例级的变化（如分布偏移、缺失数据和长尾模式）仍导致部分预测结果不理想。

Method: PIR框架首先通过估计准确性识别有偏差的预测实例，随后利用上下文信息（协变量和历史时间序列）从局部和全局视角进行后处理修正。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PIR能有效减少实例级误差并显著提升预测可靠性。

Conclusion: PIR框架为解决时间序列预测中的实例级变异问题提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning
(FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive
communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global
model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to
statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security
concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue
of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for
excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly
when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine
various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the
training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art
second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence
speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and
generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of
incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and
highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its
inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at
developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving
the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising
research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable
privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream
tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches
that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access
to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models
has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL
raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL
contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and
autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box
models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various
aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition.
Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we
compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as
noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks
obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers,
and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the
concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not
observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating
strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate
reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct
performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss
the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing
for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose
measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for
detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and
interpretability issues for automated software systems.

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying
sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for
domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support
our findings.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant
increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices
has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that
enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning
models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on
univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and
additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this
paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of
data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide
application specific data model development for training machine learning
models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of
the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of
domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four
interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets.
Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature
contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种泛化的置换不变图嵌入方法，扩展了Kondor & Borgwardt的Skew Spectrum，能处理更丰富的图结构并在计算复杂度和表达能力之间实现权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Skew Spectrum方法无法处理属性图、多层图和超图等复杂图结构，因此需要一种更通用的图嵌入方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 基于群论和调和分析，提出了一种新的图不变量家族，通过泛化保持启发式方法在相同计算成本下提升表达能力。

Result: 实验证明该方法不仅保持了不变性，还显著提升了表达能力，并讨论了其高效计算方式。

Conclusion: 该研究成功扩展了Skew Spectrum的适用范围，为复杂图结构分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings,
generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor & Borgwardt (2008). Grounded
in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of
graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer
graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and
hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization
further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between
computational complexity and expressivity. By applying
generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew
Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the
invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness
through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人工智能长期依赖经典搜索算法，但扩散模型在推理时控制生成输出以满足多样化目标方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在利用经典搜索原则解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合局部和全局搜索的通用框架：局部搜索采用退火Langevin MCMC理论方法，全局搜索则使用广度优先和深度优先树搜索以实现高效探索。

Result: 在规划、离线强化学习和图像生成等任务中，该方法在性能和效率上均取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 经典搜索为扩散模型的推理时扩展提供了理论基础和实用框架，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial
intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control
in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a
principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion
models. Project page at diffusion-inference-scaling.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管直接偏好优化（DPO）在实证中成功，但其对数比奖励参数化的理论依据尚不完整。本文旨在填补这一理论空白，并通过微分信息分布（DID）提供更深入的理解。

Method: 利用微分信息分布（DID）分析偏好标签编码的微分信息，推导出对数比奖励的最优形式，并通过熵分析策略行为的强化与平滑效应。

Result: 研究发现，偏好标签编码微分信息时，DPO的对数比奖励形式是唯一最优的；低熵微分信息强化策略分布，高熵微分信息则产生平滑效应。

Conclusion: 本文通过DID理论统一了DPO目标、偏好数据结构和策略行为，揭示了高熵微分信息对通用指令遵循的重要性，低熵微分信息对知识密集型问答的益处。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在性能上表现优异，但存在决策过程不透明和计算成本高的问题，尤其在资源受限环境中。DLN通过将离散逻辑放松为可微分形式，提供了解释性强且推理成本低的解决方案。

Method: 扩展DLN框架至监督表格回归任务，重新设计输出层以支持连续目标，并将原始两阶段训练统一为单阶段可微分过程。

Result: 在15个公共回归基准测试中，回归DLN在保持可解释性和快速推理的同时，准确率匹配或超越现代神经网络和经典回归基线。

Conclusion: DLN是回归任务中一种可行且经济高效的替代方案，特别适用于需要模型透明度和计算效率的场景。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains;
however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be
computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently
proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for
tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable
form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary
logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower
inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically,
we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the
original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We
evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it
with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs
match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast
inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative
for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational
efficiency are important.

Motivation: 现有的事后方法在自动语音识别（ASR）转录不准确时表现不佳，因此需要改进朗读错误的标注方法。

Conclusion: 结合阅读文本提示的端到端架构能有效提升朗读错误检测和转录的准确性。

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly
approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform
poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current
methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end
architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is
trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection.
Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text
through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning,
and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for
end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's
read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies
improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了MCP协议存在更广泛的基于检索的'虚假良性'攻击风险，并提出结合DPO与新型RAG-Pref方法显著提升LLMs防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明MCP协议易受'虚假良性'攻击，但攻击需用户下载文件。本文发现攻击者仅需在线发布恶意内容即可实施攻击，需加强防御措施。

Method: 构建MCP攻击数据集，测试DPO对LLMs拒绝训练的改进效果；提出RAG-Pref方法，结合检索增强生成优化偏好对齐。

Result: DPO能提升防御但效果受模型原始对齐方案影响（如GRPO模型表现差）；RAG-Pref与DPO结合使LLMs拒绝攻击能力显著提升。

Conclusion: RAG-Pref方法有效强化了LLMs对MCP攻击的防御，为生成式AI代理安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard
enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work
has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks
(FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring
that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we
show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than
previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to
deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims'
systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP
dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of
direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language
models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we
show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the
model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to
refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel
preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly
improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with
DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

Result: 在多个NAS基准测试中，该方法高效地找到了最优架构，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为图BO提供了一种有效的优化框架，适用于具有节点或边标签的NAS领域。

Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and
data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph
BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks
and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However,
the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph
structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph
search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit
optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as
reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph
kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed
encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide
restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical
results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the
optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用连续值令牌进行思维链推理（CoT2）的方法，相比传统的离散采样，CoT2提供了更丰富和更具表达力的推理方式，并在逻辑推理任务中展示了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型通过从有限词汇表中自回归采样令牌生成思维链轨迹，虽然离散采样取得了显著成功，但使用连续值令牌进行思维链推理（CoT2）可以提供更丰富和更具表达力的替代方案。

Method: 论文通过逻辑推理任务验证CoT2的优势，提出了优化和探索方法。理论分析表明，CoT2允许模型并行跟踪多个轨迹，并量化其对推理效率的益处。此外，论文还提出了一种新颖的监督策略和两种采样策略，以解锁CoT2的策略优化和自我改进能力。

Result: 实验证实，使用CoT2进行策略优化确实提高了模型的性能，超越了初始的离散或连续监督。特别是，配备CoT2的单层Transformer在足够嵌入维度下可以解决组合“子集和问题”。

Conclusion: CoT2作为一种连续值令牌的思维链推理方法，不仅提供了比离散采样更丰富的表达力，还能通过策略优化进一步提升模型性能，展示了在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively
sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has
achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with
continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive
alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning
tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and
exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model
to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference
efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably
solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding
dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy
where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a
set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that
unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy
samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the
level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second
strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex.
Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the
performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Conclusion: HDRQ方法在量化过程中最小化与源模型的偏差，并通过平滑损失表面成功解决了模型合并的难题。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解LLM中的隐式多跳推理提供了新见解，揭示了表示结构与推理能力之间的联系，并提出了增强模型透明度的途径。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop
reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly
verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by
training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our
analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,
followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution
generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but
accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level
exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we
introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies
semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based
representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with
the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn
provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across
training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These
findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop
reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold
internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent
baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently
garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to
this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs
from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback
model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner
at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited
number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback.
Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model,
provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work,
within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the
maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity
term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results
significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we
show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional
BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are
recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as
scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and
test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity.
While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and
fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new
approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space
symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we
derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and
show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode
connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter
symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we
provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by
symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which
linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role
of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the
expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform
multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the
learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data
distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,
remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we
study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires
computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden
permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On
the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that
any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for
the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in
$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we
show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and
sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log
k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in
which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$
presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is
presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency
of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers
to learn complex compositional tasks.

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely
many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields.
Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer
from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning
approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness.
In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep
Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining
output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle
that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which
we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this
oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup
factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the
correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling
method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a
tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic
computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which
reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of
$O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical
enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic
computation.

*Oleksii Furman,Ulvi Movsum-zada,Patryk Marszalek,Maciej Zięba,Marek Śmieja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiCoFlex是一种新型模型无关的条件生成框架，通过单次前向传播生成多样化的反事实解释，解决了现有方法在实时性和灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成反事实解释的方法通常需要持续访问预测模型，计算成本高，且难以适应新的用户定义约束。

Method: 利用条件归一化流（conditional normalizing flows）训练标记数据，DiCoFlex支持实时用户驱动的约束定制，如稀疏性和可操作性。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，DiCoFlex在有效性、多样性、邻近性和约束遵循方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiCoFlex为敏感决策领域的反事实生成提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives
that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance,
existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access
to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for
each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints
without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic,
conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals
in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained
solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling
real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and
actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,
diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and
scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出(U)NFV，一种模块化神经网络架构，通过扩展时空模板学习更新规则并保持守恒结构，显著提升求解双曲守恒律的精度和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲偏微分方程（尤其是含激波间断的守恒律）求解困难。传统有限体积法（FV）虽具有收敛性、守恒性等数学优势，但在复杂场景中精度和灵活性不足。

Method: 结合神经网络与FV框架：1) 通过监督学习（NFV）或弱形式残差无监督学习（UNFV）训练；2) 扩展时空模板学习更新规则；3) 严格保持守恒结构。

Result: 在一阶守恒律问题上：(U)NFV比Godunov法误差降低10倍，优于ENO/WENO格式，媲美间断Galerkin法但复杂度更低；在交通流建模中，非线性波动力学拟合精度和可扩展性显著优于传统FV方法。

Conclusion: (U)NFV通过神经网络增强FV方法，在保持物理守恒性的同时突破传统方法的精度限制，为复杂双曲PDE求解提供了高效新范式。

Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes
classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.
Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve,
particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain
shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical
properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total
variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex
settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update
rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation
structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and
unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to
first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than
Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin
solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs
and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics
with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV
approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型中引入连续控制模块对预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）语义知识的影响，并提出了一种保护VLM主干的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型通过结合端到端学习和从大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）中迁移语义知识来训练机器人控制策略。然而，实时控制的需求与VLM的设计存在冲突：强大的VLM通常参数量巨大且处理离散标记，而机器人控制需要连续输出。虽然已有研究通过引入动作专家或连续输出头来改进实时控制能力，但这些模块是否会影响预训练VLM的语义知识仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: 论文研究了包含连续扩散或流匹配动作专家的VLA模型，分析了不同设计选择对性能和知识迁移的影响，并提出了一种在VLA训练过程中保护VLM主干的技术。

Result: 研究发现，简单地引入连续动作专家会显著损害训练速度和知识迁移效果。通过提出的保护技术，可以有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 论文通过分析VLA模型中连续控制模块的影响，提出了一种保护VLM主干的方法，为改进VLA模型的训练效率和知识迁移效果提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training
control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end
learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language
model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often
at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds
of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and
operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are
required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models
have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action
experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new
untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules
improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether
they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained
VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we
study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion
or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts
significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an
extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and
knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone
during VLA training that mitigates this issue. Videos are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TiRex是一种基于xLSTM的新型零样本时间序列预测模型，通过结合状态跟踪能力和上下文学习能力，在多个基准测试中超越了现有的大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本时间序列预测方法主要依赖Transformer架构，但其在时间序列预测中表现不佳，而LSTM等循环模型虽适合时间序列建模，却缺乏强大的上下文学习能力。TiRex旨在填补这一空白。

Method: TiRex利用xLSTM（一种增强的LSTM）来结合状态跟踪能力和上下文学习能力，并提出了一种称为CPM的训练时掩码策略，以进一步增强其状态跟踪能力。

Result: TiRex在HuggingFace的GiftEval和Chronos-ZS基准测试中取得了最先进的零样本时间序列预测性能，显著优于包括TabPFN-TS、Chronos Bolt、TimesFM和Moirai在内的更大模型。

Conclusion: TiRex通过结合xLSTM的优势和CPM策略，成功地在零样本时间序列预测中实现了卓越的性能，为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks
using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time
series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past
values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful
forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when
training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely
on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often
fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models
like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited
for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack
strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap
by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning
skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as
RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon
forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a
training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in
zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and
Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS
(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)
across both short- and long-term forecasts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为COBRA的算法，用于解决多智能体情境下的上下文赌博机问题，旨在抑制智能体的策略性行为，同时保证激励兼容性和次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设智能体会如实报告其选择，但在实际应用中（如在线平台上的卖家可能虚报产品质量以获得推荐优势），这一假设不成立。因此，需要一种无需货币激励即可抑制策略性行为的方法。

Method: 提出COBRA算法，通过设计机制在不使用货币激励的情况下，抑制智能体的策略性行为，并保证激励兼容性和次线性遗憾。

Result: 实验验证了COBRA算法在抑制策略性行为和保证性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: COBRA算法成功解决了多智能体上下文赌博机问题中的策略性行为问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DiffER的新型模板自由逆向合成预测方法，基于分类扩散模型，能够同时预测整个SMILES序列，并在多项指标上达到或接近最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于自然语言处理模型的自动化学逆向合成方法虽然取得了一定成功，但由于其自回归特性存在局限性。因此，需要一种能够同时预测整个SMILES序列的替代方法。

Method: DiffER是一种基于分类扩散模型的模板自由逆向合成预测方法，通过构建扩散模型集成，并结合新颖的长度预测组件，能够近似从反应物的后验分布中采样。

Result: DiffER在top-1准确率上达到了最先进的性能，在top-3、top-5和top-10准确率上表现优异，证明了其作为新型模板自由模型的强大基线能力。

Conclusion: 分类扩散模型在逆向合成预测中表现出色，准确预测SMILES序列长度是进一步提升性能的关键。DiffER能够学习多种实验室合成技术，并在多项指标上优于其他模板自由方法。

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success
through the application of models traditionally built for natural language
processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have
demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of
chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their
autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method
for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which
allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We
construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art
performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,
and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a
strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a
variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a
variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By
constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length
prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample
from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong
metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further
boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

TL;DR: SC-LoRA是一种新型LoRA初始化框架，通过约束可训练适配器输出在低秩子空间，平衡微调效率与知识保留，显著提升性能并减少知识遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在收敛速度慢和知识遗忘问题，现有研究无法同时解决这两个问题，因此需要一种新方法来平衡微调效率和知识保留。

Method: 提出SC-LoRA框架，通过约束可训练LoRA适配器输出在低秩子空间，保留微调数据的主要特征同时避免破坏预训练知识。

Result: 实验表明，SC-LoRA在多种下游任务中表现优异，显著减少知识遗忘，优于现有LoRA初始化方法。

Conclusion: SC-LoRA成功平衡了微调效率和知识保留，为大型语言模型的高效定制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and
knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of
designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to
preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can
address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce
Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework
engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and
knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable
LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of
fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved
knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the
trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data
while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide
theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including
safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream
tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning
performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing
contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

TL;DR: DiLoCo框架在减少通信频率方面表现优异，但通信步骤仍需全量同步模型参数。本文探索了结合Top-k稀疏化和量化等压缩方法，以及使用Muon作为内部优化器，显著降低通信开销并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DiLoCo框架在减少通信频率方面表现优异，但其通信步骤仍需全量同步模型参数，导致通信开销较大。本文旨在探索如何通过压缩方法和优化内部优化器选择，进一步降低通信开销。

Method: 本文研究了Top-k稀疏化和量化等标准压缩方法，并结合两种本地优化器（AdamW和Muon）来减少DiLoCo的通信开销。特别关注了误差反馈累加器的作用以及内部优化器对压缩性的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用Muon作为内部优化器并结合误差反馈累加器，可以将通信的delta压缩至2比特，且几乎不损失性能。MuLoCo（Muon内部优化器DiLoCo）在通信量减少8倍的情况下，显著优于DiLoCo，且内存复杂度相同。

Conclusion: 通过结合Muon内部优化器和误差反馈累加器，DiLoCo框架可以显著降低通信开销，同时保持模型性能。这一方法为大规模语言模型训练提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs)
under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and
accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing
communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve
all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works
have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error
feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility
remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization
for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local
optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only
transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner
optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to
aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no
performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo)
significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having
identical memory complexity.

TL;DR: EmotionRankCLAP提出了一种基于情感维度属性的对比学习方法，通过Rank-N-Contrast目标改善跨模态对齐和情感顺序性建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于情感的CLAP方法简单对齐音频和文本，未能捕捉情感的顺序性，导致模态间理解不足和嵌入差距大。

Method: 采用监督对比学习，利用情感语音和文本提示的维度属性，通过Rank-N-Contrast目标在价-唤醒空间中排序样本。

Result: EmotionRankCLAP在跨模态检索任务中优于现有方法，能更好建模情感顺序性。

Conclusion: EmotionRankCLAP通过改进对齐和顺序性建模，提升了情感-CLAP方法的性能。

Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods
typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text
prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of
emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide
modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient
alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a
supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of
emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained
emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a
Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples
based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP
outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across
modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于社会选择理论的多元对齐方法，通过引入失真概念比较不同对齐方法的性能，发现Nash Learning在最小化失真方面表现最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法（如PPO-based RLHF和DPO）假设用户偏好单一，而实际用户偏好多样。这导致模型可能无法满足平均用户需求，因此需要一种能适应多元偏好的对齐方法。

Method: 论文借鉴社会选择理论，通过个体Bradley-Terry模型建模用户比较，引入失真概念来衡量对齐方法的性能差异。

Result: Nash Learning在最小化失真方面表现最优，失真率为$(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$；而RLHF和DPO的失真率较高，甚至在某些情况下无界。

Conclusion: Nash Learning在多元偏好对齐中具有显著优势，而传统方法如RLHF和DPO在失真率上表现较差。

Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences
based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as
PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single
preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse
preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods
produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for
pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users'
comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an
alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal
achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment
methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal
distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature
$\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison
pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO,
by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a
KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full
setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

TL;DR: 该论文提出REOrder框架，通过优化图像块排列顺序提升Transformer模型性能，在ImageNet-1K和Functional Map of the World数据集上分别实现最高3.01%和13.35%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉Transformer通常采用固定的行优先顺序展平图像，但研究发现不同的块排列顺序会显著影响模型性能，尤其是当使用长序列近似注意力机制时。

Method: 提出两阶段框架REOrder：1) 通过评估不同块序列的可压缩性建立信息论先验；2) 使用REINFORCE算法优化Plackett-Luce策略，在组合排列空间中学习最优排序策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上相比行优先排序提升最高3.01%的top-1准确率，在Functional Map of the World数据集上提升13.35%。

Conclusion: 通过学习任务最优的图像块排列顺序可以显著提升Transformer模型性能，REOrder框架为处理组合排列空间提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Result: 在线性模型和非线性深度网络上的实验结果表明，所提出的算法在模型免疫方面是有效的。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型免疫提供了理论框架和实用算法，验证了其在防止有害任务微调同时保留非有害任务性能上的潜力。

Abstract: Model immunization aims to pre-train models that are difficult to fine-tune
on harmful tasks while retaining their utility on other non-harmful tasks.
Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image
models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise
definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a
framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model
immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an
algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers
after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质复合物结构预测对功能分析、蛋白质设计和药物发现至关重要，但现有方法缺乏大规模、多样化的标注数据集来评估预测模型的质量。

Method: 作者开发了PSBench基准套件，包含四个大规模标注数据集，覆盖多种蛋白质特性，并提供多层次的评估指标和基线方法。

Result: 基于PSBench训练的GATE方法在CASP16盲测中表现优异，验证了PSBench的实用价值。

Conclusion: PSBench是推动蛋白质复合物建模质量评估研究的重要资源，已公开提供使用。

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function
analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold
can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably
estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,
or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key
barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack
of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To
address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four
large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide
Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).
PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of
protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and
modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary
quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also
provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate
rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and
evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE
was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing
EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for
advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly

Conclusion: 原子基础模型及其涌现表示在蛋白质建模中表现出色，为构建有效的蛋白质功能表征开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and
interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative
representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and
designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments'
extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model,
and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the
intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate
that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary
motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation
state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits
meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the
distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of
biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations
enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations
for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this
will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional
representations for protein environments.

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to
factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This
complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions.
Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control
strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate
limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent
systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making,
enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However,
current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time
adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of
resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to
overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities.
This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for
multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities
in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study
demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and
flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient
resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 适度稀疏的通信拓扑能优化多智能体协作，EIB-leanrner为拓扑设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems
fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping
both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While
recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct
sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and
dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a
causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous,
propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal
that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation
while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal
task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design
approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial
information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and
sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness,
communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Motivation: 电子商务的快速增长和最后一公里配送的时效性、成本效益需求推动了协作物流的发展。研究旨在解决无人机和机器人在配送中的载荷、航程和电池限制问题。

Method: 研究采用混合整数线性规划（MILP）建模，并提出启发式算法FINDER，以解决大规模实例的计算难题。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,
cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative
logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized
multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a
fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots,
cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the
launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby
addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited
range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic
features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)
flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic
and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)
en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being
transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle
transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational
challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,
FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to
provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various
instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate
significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode
and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also
provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,
drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.

systems. CrossNAS leverages the single-path one-shot weight-sharing strategy
combined with the evolutionary search for the first time in the context of PIM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非绝热耦合（NACs）在光化学和光物理过程模拟中至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且难以处理NACs的向量特性和锥形交叉奇点问题。

Method: 设计了NAC专用描述符，结合新的机器学习相位校正技术，实现了高精度NAC预测，并在MLatom开源平台上实现。

Result: 该方法在fulvene的SA-2-CASSCF(6,6)电子结构水平模拟中，达到了R²超过0.99的预测精度，显著降低了误差。

Conclusion: 该研究为加速光化学模拟提供了高效可靠的机器学习解决方案，未来可拓展至更复杂体系。

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical
and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used
fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive
to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is
challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity
near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific
descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning
NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to
success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the
efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully
ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic
structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of
$S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large
ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source
MLatom.

Conclusion: LCB-CV-UNet模型通过创新的LCB模块和数据集构建方法，有效解决了HDR雷达信号处理的挑战，显著提升了检测性能并保持了较低的计算成本。

Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High
Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient,
plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a

Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a
convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for

received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep
learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for
future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to
arbitrary interference conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架通过利用高阶拓扑特征显著提升了动态信号处理性能，为复杂网络数据分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow
signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS)
methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory,
we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming
signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed
stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions,
steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the
impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design
optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired
estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g.,
the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that
integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a
distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and
mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world
traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed
settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order
topological features.

Conclusion: NGPU-LM通过高效并行化显著提升ASR性能，其实现已开源，适用于工业场景。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding

Motivation: 现有的问答系统主要基于文本输入，而视觉问答（VQA）和语音问答（SQA）系统分别扩展了视觉和语音输入。然而，支持语音和图像多模态交互的SVQA系统缺乏相应的数据集，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 通过融合文本、语音和图像模态，构建多模态模型。为了解决数据集缺失的问题，研究使用两种零样本TTS模型合成VQA数据集。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用合成语音训练的模型性能接近基于文本问答的上限模型，且TTS模型的选择对准确率影响较小。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了多模态交互的SVQA系统，并通过合成数据集验证了其可行性，为未来多模态问答系统的发展提供了基础。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language
questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA
system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both
speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and
image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting
multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Conclusion: 该系统在实时语音增强中表现优异，后续改进后参加了2025 Urgent Challenge。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the
mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the
full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to
over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M
parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming
with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over
the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation
study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We
participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further
improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling,
typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function
via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method
that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score
function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator
associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the
solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent
sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann
distributions and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome提供了一种快速、可扩展的方法，能够跨多种分区方案生成个体特异性连接组，性能与传统方法相当。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN
upon publication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过多模态AI系统提升医学诊断的可靠性、效率和可扩展性，解决现有技术在临床环境中的局限性。

Method: 使用公开数据集，比较CNN和不同LLM模型在诊断性能、执行效率和环境影响（如能耗和CO2排放）上的差异。

Result: 尽管CNN模型在多模态技术中表现优异，但结合LLM的额外过滤能带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统具有变革潜力，能显著提升医学诊断在临床环境中的可靠性、效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely
classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets,
the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative
analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution
efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy,
F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated
$CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can
outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and
contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead
to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and
scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.

*Christian Schmidt,Heinrich Martin Overhoff*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用主成分分析（PCA）预处理医学超声图像，以提高分割模型在未见数据集上的泛化能力，实验表明PCA重建数据集能显著提升召回率和Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在跨数据集部署时存在外部有效性不足的问题，尤其在超声图像领域，现有方法如域适应和基于GAN的风格迁移在小规模多样化数据集中效果有限。

Method: 通过PCA预处理减少噪声并保留90%的数据方差，创建PCA重建数据集，并基于U-Net模型在原始和PCA数据集上进行训练与跨数据集推理对比。

Result: PCA重建数据集使召回率从0.57提升至0.70，Dice分数从0.50提升至0.58，且外部验证导致的召回率下降减少了33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建可作为有效手段提升医学图像分割模型的外部有效性，尤其在性能较差的案例中表现显著。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（如ChatGPT）的广泛应用，其推理阶段的碳排放、水资源消耗和能源成本已远超训练阶段（年运营成本达25倍），亟需可持续性优化方案。

Method: 提出SLIT框架，利用基于机器学习的元启发式算法，在分布式云数据中心中协同优化LLM的首词响应时间、碳排放、水资源消耗和能源成本。

Result: 该框架能有效平衡LLM服务质量与资源消耗，为大规模部署提供可持续解决方案。

Conclusion: SLIT框架将成为LLM普及过程中降低环境成本的关键技术，其多目标优化方法对未来绿色AI发展具有启示意义。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs
continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training
overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user
requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies
estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed
training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative
carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the
footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of
fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To
address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel
framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first
token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes
a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of
LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will
become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更有效地发现与复杂性状相关的遗传变异，需要一种能够整合生物领域知识并自动优化机器学习流程的工具。

Method: StarBASE-GP采用遗传编程的多目标优化策略，结合九种遗传编码策略、自定义连锁不平衡修剪节点和动态变异推荐系统。

Result: 在褐家鼠群体中，StarBASE-GP在识别体重指数相关变异方面表现优于随机基线和生物朴素版本，能够更准确地识别真实和新颖的数量性状位点。

Conclusion: StarBASE-GP通过整合进化搜索和生物理论，展示了在复杂性状变异发现中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool
- Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering
meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale
genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective
optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously
maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological
domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine
inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom
linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features,
and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative
candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass
index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a
biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto
fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both
ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets
for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant
biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework,
StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in
complex traits.

Motivation: 现有COVID-19预测模型主要依赖传统流行病学数据，而基因组信息、人类行为等替代数据源的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 研究评估了生物特征（如突变）、公共卫生数据（如病例数、政策干预）和人类行为特征（如移动性和社交媒体讨论）在国家层面病例激增预测中的效用。

Result: 结果显示不同特征模态和国家间预测性能存在显著异质性，表明激增预测模型需针对具体国家背景和疫情阶段进行定制。

Conclusion: 整合替代数据源可增强现有疾病监测框架，提升大流行动态预测能力。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine
learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality
rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health
interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models
are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative
datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior,
remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of
diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results
highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public
health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features
(e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level
case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive
performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge
prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and
pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating
alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to
enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

Result: 提出了“协同增强”概念，展示人机对话如何动态激发智能，为AI系统的交互与表征提供新视角。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解当代AI系统的交互性、表征能力和代理机制提供了创新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural,
behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and
experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human
Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than
stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded
in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns,
the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual
enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new
lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary
AI systems.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Orca浏览器原型，利用AI增强用户跨网页操作和信息整合能力，提升信息探索效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统浏览器在多标签页操作和大规模信息整合方面存在不足，而现有AI系统虽能自动化浏览但削弱了用户控制力。因此，研究旨在探索如何用AI辅助用户跨网页交互，减少认知和手动负担。

Method: 通过文献调研和迭代设计流程，开发了Orca浏览器原型，将网页视为可塑材料，支持用户与AI协作操作和组合内容。

Result: 评估显示，Orca增强了用户对信息探索的“胃口”，提升了控制力，并在更广泛的信息环境中实现了更灵活的感知构建。

Conclusion: Orca通过AI与用户的协同工作，有效支持了大规模网页内容的探索、操作和组织，优化了跨网页信息处理体验。

Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However,
conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and
synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems
enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often
diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore
how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages
and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information
tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present
a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca.
Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization,
and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages
are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively
manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace.
Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging,
enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader
information landscape on the web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI编程工具虽能提升程序员的能力和效率，但也可能导致用户过度依赖系统，减少主动思考，尤其在关键领域如软件安全中可能带来严重后果。

Method: 提出Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术，并在代码补全助手HiLDe中实现，该技术高亮LLM的关键决策并提供本地替代方案供用户选择。

Result: 在涉及安全相关任务的实验中，HiLDe帮助参与者生成了显著更少的安全漏洞，并更好地将代码生成与用户目标对齐。

Conclusion: HiLDe通过让用户参与决策过程，有效减少了AI编程工具的负面影响，特别是在提升代码安全性和用户目标对齐方面表现优异。

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers'
capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users
from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off
their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These
behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software
security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique
that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code
generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal
requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant
that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local
alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on
security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate
significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their
goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

Motivation: 抑郁症检测在现实世界中的效果不佳，现有方法主要依赖文本信息，忽视了非文本线索如语音语调等，且缺乏心理学专业知识。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ数据集，通过Wav2Vec提取音频特征，将其映射到基于文本的大型语言模型，并引入问答形式的心理学知识以增强模型诊断能力。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法在平均绝对误差（MAE）和均方根误差（RMSE）上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合多模态数据和心理学知识的大型语言模型在抑郁症检测中表现出更高的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特殊教育等敏感环境中，标准化问卷和自动化方法难以准确评估学生抑郁情况，且缺乏教师共情带来的个体化洞察。现有方法未能有效整合教育者的理解或解决评估中的模糊性。

Method: 提出HEAE框架，将学生叙述文本与教师基于PHQ-9框架的9维'共情向量'（EV）相结合，通过多模态融合、文本表示和分类架构优化，将隐性共情转化为结构化AI输入。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在7级抑郁严重程度分类中达到82.74%的准确率，验证了人机协同的有效性。

Conclusion: HEAE通过结构化嵌入人类共情，为情感计算提供了更负责任且伦理的路径，增强而非替代人类判断。

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Motivation: 传统多边形曲线差异度量方法如DTW和Fréchet距离存在局限性，DTW缺乏强度量性质，Fréchet距离对异常值敏感。本文旨在提出一种兼具两者优点的新方法。

Method: 提出k-DTW方法，通过参数搜索第k大匹配距离实现精确算法和(1+ε)近似算法，并分析其学习理论性质。

Result: k-DTW在曲线学习中样本需求更低，Rademacher和Gaussian复杂度界限显著优于DTW，实验证明其在聚类和最近邻分类中表现更好。

Conclusion: k-DTW是一种优于传统方法的曲线差异度量，具有更好的理论性质和实际应用效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel
dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric
properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than
the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity
measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and
give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We
prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning
theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the
problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the
curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising
separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW
admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental
illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest
neighbor classification.

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel
algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic
Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the
well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL)
setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its
stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in
the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing
theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact
formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive
high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances
MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making,
offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent
problems.

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce
the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into
two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware
binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to
significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor
performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on
full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,
which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs
into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them
directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent
weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and
inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of
LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit
quantization and binarization methods.

Motivation: 传统分类器常假设特征独立或依赖关系简单，导致在现实复杂依赖场景中表现不佳。DCC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DCC通过神经网络参数化的Copula分离学习特征的边缘分布与联合依赖结构，并支持高维扩展、半监督学习和在线适应。

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.

*Eshant English,Christoph Lippert*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出JAPAN框架，利用基于密度的适应性分数改进共形预测，解决传统残差方法在复杂分布下的保守性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共形预测方法依赖残差分数，导致预测区域过于保守且难以捕捉多模态分布的真实形状。

Method: JAPAN通过归一化流模型估计密度分数，构建紧凑、自适应的预测区域，保留有限样本覆盖保证。

Result: 实验表明JAPAN在校准性和预测区域紧密度上优于基线，适用于多变量回归和预测任务。

Conclusion: JAPAN框架通过密度分数提升了共形预测的效率，并可通过扩展进一步增加灵活性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty
quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive
tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches
commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric
constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In
particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred
around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive
distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction
Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses
density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN
estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by
thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially
disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage
guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically
validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating
good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.
We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed
framework.

### [345] [Stable Thompson Sampling: Valid Inference via Variance Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23260)
*Budhaditya Halder,Shubhayan Pan,Koulik Khamaru*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Thompson Sampling算法——Stable Thompson Sampling，通过增加对数因子的后验方差膨胀，解决了传统TS算法在统计推断中的置信区间构建问题，同时仅以对数级增加了遗憾值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling（TS）算法虽在渐近最优性和实证效果上表现优异，但其自适应采样机制导致模型参数的置信区间构建困难，限制了统计推断的有效性。

Method: 提出Stable Thompson Sampling算法，通过对后验方差进行对数因子膨胀，调整采样机制，从而在保持算法性能的同时，实现参数估计的渐近正态性。

Result: 改进后的算法在非独立同分布数据下仍能获得渐近正态的臂均值估计，且仅以对数级增加遗憾值，实现了统计推断与决策性能的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适度增加遗憾值，可有效解决自适应决策算法中的统计推断问题，为算法设计提供了新的权衡思路。

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected
via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known
to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive
sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for
model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable
Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic
factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates
of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this
statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases
regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal
a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid
statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Goodhart定律在机器学习中的形式化，特别是代理指标与目标之间的耦合效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goodhart定律指出，当度量成为目标时，它就不再是一个好的度量。尽管有实证支持，但缺乏形式化研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过放宽先前工作中的独立性假设和学习范式假设，研究代理指标与目标之间的耦合效应。

Result: 在轻尾目标和轻尾差异情况下，依赖性不影响Goodhart效应；但在轻尾目标和重尾差异情况下，过度优化的速率与差异的重尾性成反比。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，代理指标与目标之间的耦合效应在不同情况下对Goodhart定律的影响不同。

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning
models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical
evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however
being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's
law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a
proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we
alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and
the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the
effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on
Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and
light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's
effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we
exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely
proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and
the metric. %

TL;DR: 该论文研究了偏好反馈在连续参数分布类中改善参数估计的条件，提出了一种基于偏好的M估计器，显著提高了估计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，语言模型的发展凸显了偏好反馈在提升模型性能中的作用。本文旨在探讨偏好反馈在何种条件下能改善连续参数分布类的参数估计。

Method: 研究者提出了一个框架，学习者在其中观察来自未知分布的样本对及其相对偏好，这些偏好依赖于同一未知参数。通过利用确定性偏好揭示的硬约束，提出了一种新的估计器。

Result: 结果表明，基于偏好的M估计器比仅基于样本的M估计器具有更好的渐近方差，且确定性偏好进一步提高了估计效率。新估计器的估计误差缩放为O(1/n)，显著优于仅使用样本时的Θ(1/√n)速率。

Conclusion: 尽管分析假设较为严格，但在基于对数概率奖励的偏好下，高斯或拉普拉斯分布等显著案例满足这些条件，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference
feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions
under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of
continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes
pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative
preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that
preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than
sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.
Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we
propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of
$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$
rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that
matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.
While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are
satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for
preferences based on the log-probability reward.

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统极小极大最优估计器在处理实际分布时表现不佳，无法反映算法在个体实例上的性能。论文旨在通过实例最优性视角，提升算法在具体分布上的估计精度。

Method: 采用基于Good-Turing估计器的改进方法，结合局部邻域概念，设计了满足差分隐私约束的实例最优估计算法。

Result: 提出的算法在KL散度下实现了常数倍的实例最优性，且在差分隐私约束下仍保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 通过实例最优性框架和局部邻域分析，论文为离散分布估计提供了更精确的理论工具和实用算法。

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete
distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the
distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the
true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax
optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on
an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and
simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on
real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality
viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum
achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under
natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve
instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential
privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the
Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that
more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL
divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器将矩阵参数视为扁平向量处理，可能忽略其固有结构特性。Muon作为专为矩阵参数设计的优化器，虽实证表现优异，但缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过收敛速率分析比较Muon与梯度下降(GD)，并理论刻画Muon优于GD的条件，重点关注Hessian矩阵的低秩和近似块对角结构。

Result: 理论证明Muon能利用Hessian矩阵的低秩和块对角特性（神经网络训练中常见现象），实验验证了该结论。

Conclusion: Muon的优越性源于对矩阵参数结构的有效利用，为神经网络优化提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as
matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters
as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their
inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been
proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.
Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform
traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the
theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind
its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with
Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon
can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from
the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices
-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our
experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Siamese架构的新方法，用于改进高频交易中限价订单簿数据的深度学习模型性能，并结合多头注意力机制提升短期预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频交易中，限价订单簿数据的高维和波动性使得传统深度学习模型难以有效捕捉价格变动模式，尤其是缺乏精心设计的特征时。论文观察到原始数据中买卖盘存在固有对称性，且买卖价差比原始数据更稳定、复杂度更低。

Result: 在75%以上的案例中，该方法提升了基线模型性能（MLP除外）。多头注意力机制尤其能增强短期预测效果。

Conclusion: 基于对称性设计的Siamese架构能有效提升限价订单簿建模性能，多头注意力机制对短期预测具有显著增益。

Abstract: In high-frequency trading (HFT), leveraging limit order books (LOB) to model
stock price movements is crucial for achieving profitable outcomes. However,
this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the
original data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price
movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We
observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid
sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower
complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose
a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the
performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing
the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.
We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines
and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks
in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention
(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate
its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and
widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong
baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of
strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception
(MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical.
Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance,
particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of
statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions.
This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings,
the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so
it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and
large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a
framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two
fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of
approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the
slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets
related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user
opinions.

Result: 在第一种设置下，算法实现了O(min{√(KTlogN), K√T})的遗憾上界；第二种设置下，算法达到Õ((LN)^(1/3)T^(2/3))的遗憾上界。两种设置均给出了匹配下界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在特定知识假设下，委托人可以实现次线性遗憾，并成功将算法扩展到每轮激励多个臂的场景。

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite
horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of
agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal
strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent
of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the
provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The
objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.
Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes
intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where
sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the
arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this
setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of
$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to
a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly
with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under
this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to
logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both
settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously
in each round.

Conclusion: GB-QkNN通过双重优化策略为高维大数据下的近邻搜索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Conclusion: 结合变分量子算法和在线共形推理，可在NISQ设备上实现可靠的量子传感。

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum
algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing
on NISQ devices.

### [358] [Recovering Fairness Directly from Modularity: a New Way for Fair Community Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22684)
*Yufeng Wang,Yiguang Bai,Tianqing Zhu,Ismail Ben Ayed,Jing Yuan*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合公平性的社区划分新方法FairFN，通过扩展传统模块度指标并设计高效算法，显著提升了划分结果的公平性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模块度的社区划分方法往往忽视公平性，而在实际应用中公平性至关重要。为此，作者提出将公平性纳入社区划分的考量。

Method: 作者引入了保护群体网络概念，提出新的公平-模块度指标，并开发了优化框架及高效算法FairFN，该算法改进了Fast Newman方法以同时优化模块度和公平性。

Result: 实验表明，FairFN算法在不平衡数据集上相比现有方法显著提高了公平性，同时保持了高质量的划分结果。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将公平性融入社区划分，提出的FairFN算法在实际应用中展现出优越性能，为网络分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity
optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional
modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in
real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks
and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional
modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing
it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining
theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness
partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm,
enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness.
Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and
high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on
unbalanced datasets.

*Alexander Herzog,Aliai Eusebi,Lorenzo Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 现代漂移自适应恶意软件分类器性能看似良好，但实际可靠性存疑。论文提出AURORA框架，评估分类器置信度质量与操作韧性，发现现有方法在分布偏移下存在脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估范式过于依赖基线性能指标，忽视置信度-误差对齐和操作稳定性。论文旨在探究恶意软件分类器在分布偏移下能否保持可靠置信度，并解决科研进展与实际应用的矛盾。

Method: 提出AURORA框架，通过验证模型置信度剖面来评估其可靠性，并设计超越瞬时性能的指标，实现时间维度上的操作稳定性综合评估。

Result: 实验表明，现有先进框架在不同漂移程度数据集上均表现脆弱，不可靠的置信度会破坏操作信任、浪费标注资源并导致选择性分类中的漏检。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新审视现有方法，AURORA为恶意软件分类器的置信度质量和操作韧性评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear
promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The
standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics,
neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While
TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a
complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain
reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the
tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not.
We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their
confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence
profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its
estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste
valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and
leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is
further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time
performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational
stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in
state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests
the need for a return to the whiteboard.

TL;DR: 研究发现AI生成内容标签虽有助于识别虚假信息，但可能导致用户过度依赖标签，同时意外提升人工虚假信息的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI生成内容标签是否能有效降低虚假信息的风险，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 采用焦点小组定性探索用户对AI标签的看法，并通过预注册在线调查定量评估标签对识别虚假信息的影响。

Result: 标签降低了标记AI生成虚假信息的可信度，但也削弱了准确信息的可信度，并意外提高了未标记人工虚假信息的可信度。

Conclusion: AI标签虽有一定效果，但存在用户过度依赖和副作用，需进一步优化标签实施策略。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans'
interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to
create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed
regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only
little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated
misinformation.
  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we
study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling.
Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the
successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users'
opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we
conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants
to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize
misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus
groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical
implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying
AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security
benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might
over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated
images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief
in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated
image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images
conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of
labels.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CaMeL提出基于能力的沙箱防御LLM代理的提示注入攻击，但存在可信用户提示假设、侧信道忽略和性能折衷问题。本文提出四项改进措施以增强安全性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CaMeL框架在防御提示注入攻击时存在假设过强（信任用户输入）、忽略侧信道风险以及双LLM设计导致性能下降等问题，需改进以适配企业级安全需求。

Method: 提出四项改进：(1)初始输入提示筛查，(2)输出审计检测指令泄露，(3)分级风险访问模型，(4)带形式化保证的中间验证语言。

Result: 改进后的框架扩展了威胁覆盖范围（包括侧信道风险），通过分层控制平衡安全性与可用性，并引入形式化验证提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 升级后的CaMeL框架符合企业安全最佳实践，支持规模化部署，为LLM代理提供更全面的防护体系。

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based
sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM)
agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits
side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM
design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering
improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We
introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to
detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability
and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees.
Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security
and support scalable deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的权限控制大语言模型（PermLLM），旨在解决企业环境中数据隔离和访问控制的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中的数据通常被隔离和保护，但现有的大语言模型（LLM）在微调后可能破坏这些访问控制结构。因此，需要一种能够保持数据访问权限的新型LLM。

Method: 论文提出了PermLLM，通过参数高效微调（Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning）实现访问控制，并引入了相关响应和访问优势（access advantage）的概念来验证机制的正确性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集（GPQA、RCV1、SimpleQA和WMDP）上的实验表明，PermLLM机制有效，且提出的DDI和UGI指标能够量化LLM中的访问控制。

Conclusion: PermLLM是一种有效的方法，能够在保持数据访问权限的同时，确保LLM生成的响应符合组织的访问控制要求。

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and
carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access
control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed
data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate
access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs
that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query
responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to
determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query
responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can
be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We
also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate
the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM
mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired
access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access
advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership
Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility
evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through
extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP),
in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for
quantifying access control in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SoC安全验证依赖人工且方法僵化，导致RTL级漏洞检测效率低下，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 通过微调LLM增强硬件安全知识，结合文本推理和知识迁移能力，构建开源专用模型及配套漏洞数据库。

Result: 定制化LLM显著提升验证流程的适应性和复用性，实验证明其能有效检测SoC设计中的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: BugWhisperer框架为SoC安全验证提供了可扩展的自动化方案，开源资源将推动领域研究进展。

Abstract: The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces
challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These
issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making
bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper
proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized,
fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing
the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text
inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the
adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an
open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security
vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM
effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security
verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware
vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the
research community in enhancing the security verification process.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出AgentAlign框架，通过抽象行为链合成安全对齐数据，显著提升LLM代理的安全性（35.8%至79.5%改进）且不影响实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM获得代理能力，其恶意使用风险激增。现有研究表明，即使未被攻击，基于LLM的代理也会执行恶意任务，表明训练后阶段缺乏安全对齐。

Method: 提出AgentAlign框架：利用抽象行为链作为数据合成媒介，在模拟环境中实例化多样工具链，生成高真实性指令并捕捉多步动态，同时按比例合成良性指令以平衡效用与安全。

Result: 在AgentHarm基准测试中，该方法使三类开源模型安全性提升35.8%-79.5%，实用性几乎不受影响甚至提升，显著优于提示方法。代码与数据集已开源。

Conclusion: AgentAlign通过行为链驱动的安全数据合成，有效解决了LLM代理的安全对齐问题，在保持实用性的同时大幅降低恶意行为风险。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

TL;DR: 提出AdvOF攻击框架，通过生成对抗性3D对象来针对服务导向环境中的视觉语言导航（VLN）代理，揭示VLM感知模块的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）虽提升了导航系统的感知与决策能力，但其集成也引入了关键任务服务流程中的安全漏洞。现有攻击方法未充分考虑服务计算场景对可靠性和服务质量（QoS）的高要求。

Method: AdvOF首先在2D和3D空间精确对齐受害者对象位置并渲染对抗对象，随后通过物理属性和VLM感知的联合正则化优化对抗对象，并基于多视角重要性权重进行迭代融合优化。

Result: 实验表明，AdvOF能在对抗条件下显著降低VLN代理性能，同时最小化对正常导航任务的干扰。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对VLM驱动导航系统服务安全的理解，为现实部署中的鲁棒服务组合提供了计算基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

Conclusion: 信息流控制是保障AI代理安全的有效途径，Fides规划器通过新颖的设计提升了安全性和任务执行能力。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable, ensuring their
security against vulnerabilities such as prompt injection becomes critical.
This paper explores the use of information-flow control (IFC) to provide
security guarantees for AI agents. We present a formal model to reason about
the security and expressiveness of agent planners. Using this model, we
characterize the class of properties enforceable by dynamic taint-tracking and
construct a taxonomy of tasks to evaluate security and utility trade-offs of
planner designs. Informed by this exploration, we present Fides, a planner that
tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces
security policies, and introduces novel primitives for selectively hiding
information. Its evaluation in AgentDojo demonstrates that this approach
broadens the range of tasks that can be securely accomplished. A tutorial to

Motivation: 研究数据重构的安全定义，重新审视指纹码攻击（FPC）的性质，并探讨在仅防止重构攻击（而非成员推断攻击）时，FPC的不可能性结果是否仍然适用。

Method: 采用贝叶斯视角分析数据重构，提出新的安全定义，并通过理论分析重新分类指纹码攻击。

Result: 指纹码攻击实质上是成员推断攻击而非重构攻击；在仅防止重构攻击的场景下，FPC的不可能性结果可能不再成立。

Conclusion: 通过新视角重新定义了数据重构安全性，为隐私保护提供了更清晰的理论边界。

Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian perspective on the concept of data
reconstruction, and leverage this viewpoint to propose a new security
definition that, in certain settings, provably prevents reconstruction attacks.
We use our paradigm to shed new light on one of the most notorious attacks in
the privacy and memorization literature - fingerprinting code attacks (FPC). We
argue that these attacks are really a form of membership inference attacks,
rather than reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we show that if the goal is
solely to prevent reconstruction (but not membership inference), then in some
cases the impossibility results derived from FPC no longer apply.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms for recommender

classifies existing approaches into two categories: (1) Pure LLM Recommenders,
which rely solely on LLMs, and (2) Augmented LLM Recommenders, which integrate
additional non-LLM techniques to enhance performance. This taxonomy provides a

recommendation. To support fair comparison, we introduce a unified evaluation

Motivation: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在大型语言模型(LLM)中虽能支持复杂推理，但在信息检索(IR)中易导致过度思考，产生冗余且偏离用户意图的推理轨迹。

Method: 提出State Machine Reasoning (SMR)，一种基于状态转移的推理框架，包含Refine、Rerank和Stop三种离散动作，支持早期停止和细粒度控制。

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT基准测试中，SMR将检索性能(nDCG@10)提升3.4%，同时减少74.4%的token使用，且无需任务特定调优即可泛化至不同LLM和检索器。

Conclusion: SMR为传统CoT推理提供了实用替代方案，平衡了推理效率与检索效果。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However,
it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and
semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key
challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and
misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we
propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework
composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping
and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show
that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token
usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring
task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT
reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask
4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving
relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this
task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision,
semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust
retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we
combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a
fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns
the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are
then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the
development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on
the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31
teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to
the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running
open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the
effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.

Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when
guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For
example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be
both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper
crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical
for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion
for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the
new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with
atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts
atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their
user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to
rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system
development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are
manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially
generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect
utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic
selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based
judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that
serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with
ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual
annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we
hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in
this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go
beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

### [373] [TailorSQL: An NL2SQL System Tailored to Your Query Workload](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23039)
*Kapil Vaidya,Jialin Ding,Sebastian Kosak,David Kernert,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Abhinav Tripathy,Ramesh Balan,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: TailorSQL利用历史查询负载信息提升NL2SQL的准确性和效率，相比现有方法提升2倍执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术仅依赖数据库模式信息，忽略了历史查询负载中隐含的有价值信息（如常见连接路径、模糊命名表/列语义），而这些信息能显著提升翻译准确性和延迟。

Method: 提出TailorSQL系统，通过分析目标数据库的历史查询负载，提取模式中未显式包含的上下文信息（如高频连接路径、表列语义），结合预训练大语言模型生成更精准的SQL查询。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TailorSQL实现了高达2倍的执行准确率提升。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询负载信息是优化NL2SQL性能的有效途径，TailorSQL证明了该方法的显著优势。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前多变量时间序列分类方法缺乏可解释性，难以满足实际应用中对透明决策的需求。本文旨在开发一种既能保持高性能又能提供可解释结果的混合方法。

Method: 提出EMeriTAte+DF框架：1) 通过后验可解释阶段将数值数据描述为带数值载荷的并发成分；2) 扩展事件驱动文献以设计支持并发成分的规约挖掘算法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多变量时间序列分类任务上优于现有最先进方案，验证了所提方法论的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功构建了性能优越且具有可解释性的混合时序分析框架，为复杂时序数据的理解与决策提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper offers a hybrid explainable temporal data processing pipeline,
DataFul Explainable MultivariatE coRrelatIonal Temporal Artificial inTElligence
(EMeriTAte+DF), bridging numerical-driven temporal data classification with an
event-based one through verified artificial intelligence principles, enabling
human-explainable results. This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori
explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent
constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the
event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting
concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform
state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus
showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

*Jang-Hyun Kim,Jinuk Kim,Sangwoo Kwon,Jae W. Lee,Sangdoo Yun,Hyun Oh Song*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: KVzip是一种查询无关的KV缓存淘汰方法，通过压缩和重用KV缓存，显著减少内存开销和注意力延迟，性能损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，Transformer大模型的KV缓存占用内存过大，导致内存开销和注意力延迟显著上升。

Method: KVzip利用LLM量化KV对的重要性，通过重建原始上下文淘汰低重要性KV对，实现跨查询的缓存压缩与重用。

Result: 实验表明KVzip将KV缓存缩小3-4倍，解码延迟降低约2倍，在多种任务和模型（如LLaMA3.1-8B）中性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: KVzip在多查询场景下显著优于现有方法，即使缓存预算比为90%也能保持性能，解决了KV缓存膨胀问题。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value
(KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand,
leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This
paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling
effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip
quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct
original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower
importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV
cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately
2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval,
reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models
such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching
up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV
eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache
budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无需对数据分布做任何假设即可解决的统计问题，特别是凸M估计和随机优化问题，并确定了可解与不可解问题的精确分界线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，统计学和学习理论一直在探讨哪些统计问题可以在不对底层数据分布做任何假设的情况下解决。本文旨在明确刻画单变量凸M估计或随机优化问题在无假设条件下的可解性。

Method: 论文通过理论分析，确定了凸M估计和随机优化问题在无分布假设下的可解性条件，并探讨了这些条件与传统机器学习可学习性表征的区别。

Result: 研究发现，损失函数的Lipschitz连续性对于无分布最小化并非必要，且这些条件与机器学习中的经典可学习性表征不同。

Conclusion: 论文为无分布假设下的统计问题提供了一个清晰的可解性分界线，揭示了损失函数连续性并非必要条件，并拓展了传统可学习性的理解。

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are
solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has
long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a
(univariate) convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable
in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between
solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps
surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not
necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from
classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在无向连通图上基于部分线性测量和平滑性假设的潜在信号估计问题，证明了平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器的弱一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在图结构数据中，仅通过少量顶点的部分线性测量，利用信号平滑性假设来估计所有顶点的潜在信号。

Method: 使用平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器，假设信号在图上的二次变化较小，推导非渐近误差界。

Result: 证明了对于某些图结构，即使在每个顶点仅测量一个坐标且测量顶点比例趋近于零的情况下，估计器仍具有弱一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于稀疏和不连通的测量图，扩展了潜在信号估计的应用范围。

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each
vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given
partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of
the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are
smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over
the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error
for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares
estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this
estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially
very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a
vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a
``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths
of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are
obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency
is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are
very sparse and disconnected.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了分布式联邦学习(DFL)在车联网中用于安全消息分类的有效性，相比纯本地训练能显著提升分类准确率，但也揭示了其在多域攻击下的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网中传统集中式或纯本地机器学习方法因规模大、高移动性和数据异构性存在局限，需探索更高效的协作学习方案。

Method: 采用分布式联邦学习(DFL)，车辆通过单跳邻居交换模型更新并多跳传播模型，使用VeReMi扩展数据集验证。

Result: DFL显著提升所有车辆分类准确率（尤其低准确率车辆），但面临无线干扰和训练数据投毒等多域攻击时表现脆弱。

Conclusion: DFL能有效促进车联网知识共享，但需开发更强健策略以抵御多域攻击。

Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message
classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust
strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

TL;DR: 论文提出BinauralFlow框架，通过流匹配和因果U-Net架构实现高质量、可流式推理的双耳音频合成，效果接近真实录音。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双耳音频渲染方法在质量和流式推理方面存在不足，需精确建模双耳线索、房间混响和环境音。

Method: 采用条件流匹配模型将双耳渲染视为生成问题，设计因果U-Net架构支持流式推理，并引入连续推理流水线提升连续性。

Result: 定量、定性评估显示方法优于SOTA，感知实验表明42%混淆率接近真实录音。

Conclusion: BinauralFlow框架在双耳音频合成的质量和实时性上取得突破，接近人耳自然听觉体验。

Abstract: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural
hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener.
Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle
with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality
binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires
precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds.
Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address
these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech
synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a
generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional
flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal
U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past
information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we
introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT
operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to
improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A
perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable
from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

Abstract: Auscultation is crucial for diagnosing lung diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic
has revealed the limitations of traditional, in-person lung sound assessments.
To overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of new diagnostic methods. In
this context, our study aims to use smartphone microphones to record and
analyze lung sounds. We faced two major challenges: the difference in audio
style between electronic stethoscopes and smartphone microphones, and the
variability among patients. To address these challenges, we developed a method
called Patient Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning (PD-SCL). By integrating
this method with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, we
significantly improved its performance by 2.4\% compared to the original AST
model. This progress demonstrates that smartphones can effectively diagnose
lung sounds, addressing inconsistencies in patient data and showing potential
for broad use beyond traditional clinical settings. Our research contributes to
making lung disease detection more accessible in the post-COVID-19 world.

Method: 设计并3D打印Nosey系统，与商业鼻音设备进行对比测试，并探讨硬件定制方法。

Result: Nosey的鼻音评分高于商业设备，但两者在语音环境对比上表现相似。

Conclusion: Nosey是商业鼻音设备的灵活且经济高效的替代品，适用于数据收集。

Abstract: We introduce Nosey (Nasalance Open Source Estimation sYstem), a low-cost,
customizable, 3D-printed system for recording acoustic nasalance data that we
have made available as open-source hardware
(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in
data collection.

Motivation: 现有方法受限于固定的乐器类别，无法灵活处理任意乐器源。MGE-LDM旨在通过统一的潜在扩散模型，实现对完整混音、子混音和单独音轨的联合建模。

Method: MGE-LDM将分离和补全任务建模为潜在空间中的条件修复任务，通过单一紧凑的潜在扩散模型学习联合分布，支持跨异构多轨数据集的联合训练。

Conclusion: MGE-LDM提供了一个灵活且类别无关的框架，能够统一处理音乐生成、源补全和分离任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous
music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike
prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a
joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within
a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1)
complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation),
and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both
separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space,
our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary
instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across
heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without
relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our

Result: 基于STM的模型在未经预训练的情况下，对自然语音、音乐和环境声音的分类性能与预训练音频DNNs相当。

Conclusion: STM是一种高效且可解释的音频特征表示方法，推动了机器听觉的发展，并为语音和听觉科学的基础理解、音频脑机接口和认知计算开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine
listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally
costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a
novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal
processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the
human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model,
without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across
diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are
essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These
results show that STM is an efficient and interpretable feature representation
for audio classification, advancing the development of machine listening and
unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and
auditory sciences, as well as developing audio BCI and cognitive computing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, particularly in voice
cloning, have intensified the demand for adaptable and efficient deepfake
detection methods. As TTS systems continue to evolve, detection models must be
able to efficiently adapt to previously unseen generation models with minimal
data. This paper introduces ADD-GP, a few-shot adaptive framework based on a
Gaussian Process (GP) classifier for Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD). We show
how the combination of a powerful deep embedding model with the Gaussian
processes flexibility can achieve strong performance and adaptability.
Additionally, we show this approach can also be used for personalized
detection, with greater robustness to new TTS models and one-shot adaptability.
To support our evaluation, a benchmark dataset is constructed for this task
using new state-of-the-art voice cloning models.

Motivation: 研究具有前馈神经网络非线性反馈的Lur'e型系统的局部稳定性，提出更有效的吸引域估计方法，以解决现有方法保守性和可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: 论文采用基于正性系统约束的局部化Aizerman猜想，开发了两种方法：(i) 基于Lyapunov函数的LMI方法，(ii) 通过逐层线性松弛传播计算FFNN局部扇区界的新技术。

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方法在吸引域大小和可扩展性方面显著优于现有的积分二次约束方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法能有效验证Lur'e型系统在前馈神经网络反馈下的局部指数稳定性，为非线性控制系统分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with
static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By
leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the
Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential
stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we
develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i)
a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel
sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and
(ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via
layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into
the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability.
Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral
quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology
based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G
revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging
strategies under realistic scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出ConnectomeDiffuser框架，通过自动化端到端DTI脑网络构建，提升神经退行性疾病诊断精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTI脑网络构建方法存在操作主观性强、流程繁琐、难以捕捉复杂拓扑特征等局限性，需开发更高效的自动化工具。

Method: 结合模板网络（Riemann几何特征提取）、扩散模型（增强拓扑保真度）和图卷积网络（整合疾病生物标志物）的三阶段框架。

Result: 在两种神经退行性疾病数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法，能更敏感捕捉个体脑网络变异。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床提供通用化测量工具，有助于AD等疾病的精准诊断、机制研究和治疗监测。

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Conclusion: 该理论为自组织吸引子网络提供了统一解释，拓展了传统玻尔兹曼机，对生物合理计算和AI设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the
brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first
principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations
and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how
attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal
partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for
explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but
efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such
self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian
active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior
beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning
fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via
simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately
orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously
optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors
efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual
information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while
random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential
data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics,
offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings
offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel
insights for AI and neuroscience.

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction
industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building
structures throughout their lifecycle. However, existing research lacks
effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological

"semantic-spatial-topological" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models.
By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local
spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich
the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed
understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design
patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial
relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation
and learning of design patterns.

Conclusion: 结论指出，尽管提出了CONTEXT-ALIGN框架，但现有技术仍难以完全实现与人类沟通规范的对齐。

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像异常分割方法通常需要手动设定阈值，MIAS-SAM旨在通过记忆库和SAM模型实现无阈值自动化分割。

Method: 使用SAM编码器提取正常图像特征存入记忆库，推理时通过比对生成异常图，并利用重心坐标提示SAM解码器完成分割。

Result: 在脑MRI、肝脏CT和视网膜OCT三个公开数据集上，DICE分数验证了该方法的高精度分割能力。

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM通过创新性记忆库机制实现了无需阈值的端到端异常分割，为多模态医学图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code

TL;DR: 提出VIMTS框架，通过视觉MAE处理不规则多变量时间序列预测，解决数据缺失和通道不对齐问题，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不规则多变量时间序列(IMTS)预测因多通道信号不对齐和大量数据缺失而困难，现有方法难以捕捉可靠时间模式。视觉MAE在稀疏多通道数据建模上的潜力激发了将其应用于IMTS的动机。

Method: VIMTS框架将IMTS沿时间线等间隔划分为特征块，利用学习的跨通道依赖补充缺失值，结合视觉MAE的稀疏多通道数据处理能力进行块重建，并通过粗到细技术生成精确预测。

Result: 大量实验证明VIMTS在IMTS预测上表现优异，并具备少样本学习能力，推动了视觉基础模型在更广泛时间序列任务中的应用。

Conclusion: VIMTS成功将视觉MAE适配于IMTS预测，通过特征块处理和跨通道依赖学习有效解决了数据缺失问题，为通用时间序列任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/WHU-HZY/VIMTS.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

TL;DR: GeoMan提出了一种新颖架构，通过结合图像模型和视频扩散模型，从单目视频中估计准确且时间一致的3D人体几何形状，解决了现有方法在时间一致性和细节捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单张图像优化，难以保持视频中3D人体几何形状的时间一致性，且无法捕捉细粒度的动态细节。高质量4D训练数据的稀缺和准确人体尺寸估计的需求也是主要挑战。

Method: GeoMan采用图像模型估计视频第一帧的深度和法线，然后通过视频扩散模型生成后续帧，将视频几何估计任务转化为图像到视频的生成问题。此外，引入根相对深度表示以保留人体尺寸细节。

Result: GeoMan在定性和定量评估中均达到最先进水平，显著提升了时间一致性和泛化能力，同时减少了对4D训练数据的依赖。

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新的架构和深度表示，有效解决了3D人体几何估计中的时间一致性和尺寸准确性难题，为视频中的人体建模提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

### [403] [EAD: An EEG Adapter for Automated Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23107)
*Pushapdeep Singh,Jyoti Nigam,Medicherla Vamsi Krishna,Arnav Bhavsar,Aditya Nigam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EEG Adapter (EAD)的灵活框架，用于处理不同采集设备获取的EEG信号，通过学习鲁棒的表示实现分类任务，并在多个数据集上取得了优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号解码通常需要针对特定任务采集数据，且不同设备的通道数差异导致传统流程无法通用。因此，需要开发一个统一的框架来处理不同通道数的EEG数据。

Method: 作者提出了EAD框架，基于EEG基础模型进行适配，学习鲁棒的EEG表示，适用于任何信号采集设备。

Result: 在EEG-ImageNet和BrainLat数据集上分别达到99.33%和92.31%的准确率，并在零样本分类任务中展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAD框架能有效处理不同设备和任务的EEG数据，为EEG信号分类提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: VScan提出了一种两阶段视觉令牌缩减框架，通过全局和局部扫描结合令牌合并及语言模型中间层剪枝，显著提升大视觉语言模型的推理速度并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因细粒度视觉感知导致计算成本高，难以实时部署。现有方法在视觉编码器输出层或语言模型早期层剪枝，但效果有限。

Method: VScan框架分两阶段：1）视觉编码阶段融合全局与局部扫描进行令牌合并；2）在语言模型中间层引入剪枝，减少冗余令牌。

Result: 在四个LVLMs和十六个基准测试中，VScan显著加速推理（LLaVA-NeXT-7B预填充速度提升2.91倍，FLOPs减少10倍），性能保留95.4%。

Conclusion: VScan通过优化令牌处理流程，实现了高效的大视觉语言模型推理，性能接近原始模型，为实时部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在文化多样性理解上存在不足，缺乏系统分析图像文化维度的框架，需结合文化研究理论填补这一空白。

Method: 基于视觉文化研究（文化研究、符号学、视觉研究）的基础方法论，提出五个文化维度框架用于分析VLMs的文化能力。

Result: 提出了一个包含五个文化维度的系统性框架，为全面评估VLMs的文化能力提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 结合视觉文化研究的理论框架能更全面地分析和提升VLMs的文化理解能力。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Zero-to-Hero的参考视频编辑方法，通过分解编辑过程为两个阶段，实现更精细的外观控制和更高的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导视频编辑方法存在用户意图模糊和对对象特定方面控制不足的问题，需要一种更精确和一致的方法。

Method: Zero-to-Hero方法将编辑过程分为两个阶段：Zero阶段通过编辑锚帧作为参考图像，Hero阶段通过条件生成模型进行视频恢复，利用原始帧的对应关系引导注意力机制。

Result: 该方法在PSNR上比最佳基线提高了2.6 dB，并在处理大运动对象时表现出更高的鲁棒性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Zero-to-Hero方法通过分阶段处理和条件生成模型，显著提升了视频外观编辑的准确性和一致性，为视频编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

*Jeongsol Kim,Yeobin Hong,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowAlign提出了一种无需反演的基于流的图像编辑框架，通过流匹配损失提升编辑轨迹的稳定性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无需反演的流式图像编辑方法（如FlowEdit）虽然避免了精确的潜在反演，但常导致编辑轨迹不稳定和源图像一致性差的问题。

Method: FlowAlign引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡编辑提示的语义对齐和源图像的结构一致性，并支持通过反向ODE轨迹实现反向编辑。

Result: 实验表明，FlowAlign在源图像保留和编辑可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign通过流匹配损失实现了更稳定和一致的图像编辑，展示了其可逆和一致性的优势。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用CLIP模型（无需解码器、训练或微调）实现图像合成的方法，通过频率感知隐式神经表示等技术解锁了文本生成图像、风格迁移等功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索判别式模型（如CLIP）潜在的生成能力，证明其无需额外训练即可直接用于图像生成任务。

Method: 采用频率分层网络结构、对抗鲁棒初始化、正交Procrustes投影对齐嵌入空间，以及自然图像统计锚定的混合损失函数。

Result: 实现了文本生成图像、风格迁移和图像重建，且不修改CLIP原始权重。

Conclusion: 判别式模型中存在未被开发的生成潜力，可通过适当方法直接激活。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能攻击现有检测系统，还可为训练更鲁棒的AIGC检测防御系统提供数据支持。

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of
photorealistic human portraits, raising serious concerns about identity misuse
and the robustness of AIGC detectors. In this work, we propose an automated
adversarial prompt generation framework that leverages a grammar tree structure
and a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to systematically
explore the semantic prompt space. Our method generates diverse, controllable
prompts that consistently evade both open-source and commercial AIGC detectors.
Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,
and the approach ranked first in a real-world adversarial AIGC detection
competition. Beyond attack scenarios, our method can also be used to construct
high-quality adversarial datasets, providing valuable resources for training
and evaluating more robust AIGC detection and defense systems.

TL;DR: SAMamba提出了一种结合SAM2层次特征学习和Mamba选择性序列建模的新框架，通过FS-Adapter、CSI模块和DPCF模块解决红外小目标检测中的信息丢失和全局上下文建模问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在军事、海事和预警应用中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。

Method: SAMamba框架集成了FS-Adapter进行自然到红外域适应，CSI模块用于高效全局上下文建模，DPCF模块自适应融合多尺度特征。

Result: 在NUAA-SIRST、IRSTD-1k和NUDT-SIRST数据集上，SAMamba显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂背景和不同目标尺度场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: SAMamba通过桥接域差距、保持细粒度细节和高效建模长距离依赖，有效解决了红外小目标检测的核心挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了R2I-Bench基准和R2IScore评估指标，用于系统评估文本到图像生成模型的推理能力，发现现有模型在推理性能上普遍不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像（T2I）生成模型虽然在生成逼真图像方面取得了显著进展，但其推理能力仍未被充分开发和评估。为此，作者旨在填补这一空白，通过构建一个全面的基准来严格评估推理驱动的T2I生成。

Method: 作者引入了R2I-Bench基准，包含精心策划的数据实例，涵盖常识、数学、逻辑等多个核心推理类别。此外，设计了R2IScore评估指标，基于特定实例的推理导向问题，从文本-图像对齐、推理准确性和图像质量三个维度进行细粒度评估。

Result: 通过对16个代表性T2I模型的广泛实验，包括一个基于最新语言和图像生成模型的强管道框架，结果显示这些模型在推理性能上普遍有限，表明需要开发更强大、具备推理意识的下一代T2I系统架构。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了当前T2I模型在推理能力上的不足，并提出了R2I-Bench基准和R2IScore评估指标，为未来开发更强大的推理驱动T2I系统提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Conclusion: 通过结合视频帧和转录文本的多模态强化学习框架，论文提出的方法能够有效生成高质量的视频摘要和高光片段，且无需依赖标注数据，适用于大规模未标注数据集。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有无监督语义分割方法依赖集中式数据训练，而联邦学习环境下特征表示和聚类中心的对齐在异构数据分布中极具挑战性。

Method: FUSS框架提出新颖的联邦策略：1) 联合优化本地分割头和共享语义中心 2) 在特征空间和原型空间强制全局一致性。

Result: 在基准数据集和真实场景（二分类/多分类任务）中，FUSS始终优于纯本地训练方案及传统联邦学习算法的扩展版本。

Conclusion: FUSS首次实现了去中心化无监督语义分割，其联邦策略有效解决了特征和聚类中心对齐问题，代码将在论文接受后开源。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注自然视频，忽视AIGC视频，且MLLMs在AIGC视频上的能力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含四项任务：连贯性验证、错误感知、错误类型检测和推理评估，并实验RePrompt方法。

Result: 评估13个前沿MLLMs，发现即使最佳模型GPT-4.1在所有任务中表现也不稳定。

Conclusion: VF-Eval具有挑战性，且通过人类反馈对齐MLLMs可改进视频生成。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对行人属性识别（PAR）的对抗攻击与防御框架ASL-PAR，通过全局和局部攻击测试模型鲁棒性，并设计语义偏移防御策略。实验验证了其在数字和物理域的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度学习的行人属性识别取得进展，但其抗干扰能力和潜在脆弱性尚未充分研究。论文旨在填补这一空白，探索PAR模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 基于CLIP预训练框架，采用多模态Transformer融合视觉与文本特征，通过对抗语义和标签扰动生成噪声（ASL-PAR），并设计语义偏移防御策略。

Result: 在PETA等4个数据集上的实验表明，所提攻击方法能有效干扰模型，防御策略显著提升模型抗干扰能力，数字与物理域结果均验证有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为PAR系统安全性提供了首个对抗攻防框架，开源代码将促进社区进一步研究。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MMSI-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在多图像空间推理能力上的表现，发现当前模型与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试仅关注单图像关系，无法满足现实世界中多图像空间推理的需求，因此需要一个新的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 研究者们耗时300多小时，从12万张图像中精心设计了1,000个具有挑战性的多选题，并评估了34个开源和专有MLLM模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，最强的开源模型准确率约为30%，OpenAI的o3推理模型达到40%，而人类得分高达97%。

Conclusion: MMSI-Bench揭示了当前模型在多图像空间推理上的不足，并提供了自动化错误分析流程，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for
advancing multi-image spatial intelligence. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用强化学习（RL）微调预训练生成模型的方法，特别是应用GRPO优化视觉自回归模型，以更好地符合人类偏好并提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于通过强化学习微调生成模型，使其输出更符合复杂的审美偏好，并探索模型在预训练数据分布之外的泛化能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合美学预测器和CLIP嵌入的奖励信号，对视觉自回归模型进行微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了图像质量，并实现了对生成风格的精确控制，同时模型能够生成预训练数据中未涵盖的风格图像。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的微调方法对视觉自回归模型既高效又有效，尤其得益于其快速的推理速度，适用于在线采样，相较于基于扩散的模型具有优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

### [419] [PAN-Crafter: Learning Modality-Consistent Alignment for PAN-Sharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23367)
*Jeonghyeok Do,Sungpyo Kim,Geunhyuk Youk,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAN-Crafter提出了一种模态一致对齐框架，通过模态自适应重建和跨模态对齐感知注意力机制，有效解决了PAN与MS图像间的错位问题，显著提升了融合效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法假设PAN与MS图像像素级对齐，但在实际应用中，传感器位置、采集时间和分辨率差异导致的跨模态错位会引发光谱失真、重影和模糊问题。

Method: 1) 模态自适应重建(MARs)：通过联合重建HRMS和PAN图像，利用PAN高频细节作为自监督信号；2) 跨模态对齐感知注意力(CM3A)：双向对齐MS纹理与PAN结构，实现跨模态自适应特征优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PAN-Crafter所有指标超越现有最优方法，推理速度提升50.11倍，内存占用减少37%。在未见卫星数据上也表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter通过显式建模模态间对齐关系，实现了高效鲁棒的PAN锐化，为跨模态图像融合提供了新范式。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VModA框架，显著提升NSFW内容检测准确率54.3%，适应多平台规则并修复数据集标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NSFW内容检测方法难以应对复杂语义和跨平台规则差异，导致漏检和准确率下降，亟需通用解决方案。

Method: 提出VModA框架，适配多样化审核规则，处理跨类别复杂语义NSFW内容，基于视觉语言模型改进。

Result: 实验显示VModA准确率最高提升54.3%，成功修正公开数据集中不一致标签，并在实际场景验证有效性。

Conclusion: VModA为NSFW检测提供强适应性解决方案，推动内容审核技术发展并改善数据集质量。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉配音方法存在局限性，如生成的面部动作难以无缝融入原始场景，或修复技术丢弃重要视觉信息。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EdiDub将视觉配音重新定义为内容感知编辑任务，采用专用条件方案保留原始视频上下文，确保修改的准确性和忠实性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EdiDub显著提升了身份保持和同步效果，人类评估也显示其在同步性和视觉自然度上优于领先方法。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法在保持复杂视觉元素和准确唇部同步方面优于传统方法，EdiDub框架展现了显著优势。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）虽能实现近原子级分辨率成像，但高质量标注数据稀缺阻碍了模型开发。现有合成方法难以同时捕捉生物样本的结构多样性和复杂的空间变化噪声。

Method: CryoCCD整合生物物理建模与生成技术，通过组分异质性、细胞环境和物理成像模拟多尺度图像，并采用条件扩散模型（结合循环一致性和掩码感知对比学习）生成逼真噪声。

Result: 实验表明，CryoCCD生成的图像结构准确，在颗粒挑选和重构任务中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为冷冻电镜数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，并验证了合成数据对下游任务的提升作用。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Motivation: 多任务学习在医学影像领域具有优势，但任务贡献平衡仍是一大挑战。现有方法常伴随高计算开销，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: DeepChest采用基于任务特定损失趋势分析的性能驱动加权机制，无需梯度访问，自适应调整任务重要性，降低内存使用并加速训练。

Result: 实验表明，DeepChest在整体准确率上优于现有方法7%，同时显著减少各任务损失，提升泛化能力并缓解负迁移。

Conclusion: DeepChest的高效性和性能提升为深度学习在关键医学诊断应用中的实际部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于物体轨迹的视频token化方法TrajViT，显著减少冗余token并保持性能，在多项视频理解任务中超越传统时空ViT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频token化方法使用固定时空块导致token冗余且计算效率低，尤其在摄像机移动时效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于全景子物体轨迹的token化方法TrajViT，通过对比学习训练，将物体轨迹转化为语义化token。

Result: TrajViT在视频文本检索任务中top-5召回率提升6%，token减少10倍；作为VideoLLM编码器时性能平均提升5.2%，训练速度加快4倍，推理FLOPs减少18倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT是首个在多样化视频分析任务中持续优于ViT3D的高效编码器，具有强扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Motivation: 传统特征提取方法对输入的小变化敏感，而持久同调（PH）能稳定提取数据的拓扑特征。研究旨在比较两种基于PH的特征构建方法对分类模型的影响。

Method: 通过聚合持久条形码后特征化（方法1）或串联各条形码的拓扑特征向量（方法2）构建最终特征向量，并在多组医学影像数据集上进行对比实验。

Result: 实验表明，特征串联法能保留单个条形码的详细拓扑信息，分类性能更优。

Conclusion: 在类似实验中，特征串联是更优的拓扑特征构建方法。

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出CLDTracker，一种利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）增强视觉目标跟踪（VOT）的新框架，通过双分支结构和丰富的文本描述解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪器主要依赖视觉线索，在复杂场景中表现不佳。视觉语言模型（VLMs）在语义理解方面表现出潜力，但直接应用于VOT存在文本表示不足、特征融合效率低和缺乏时间建模等问题。

Method: 提出CLDTracker框架，采用双分支结构（文本分支和视觉分支），利用CLIP和GPT-4V等VLMs生成丰富的文本描述，并结合语义和上下文线索。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中，CLDTracker实现了最先进的性能，验证了其利用视觉语言表示进行跟踪的有效性。

Conclusion: CLDTracker通过结合视觉和语言信息，显著提升了VOT的鲁棒性和适应性，展示了VLMs在跟踪任务中的潜力。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅依靠图像进行黑色素瘤检测和皮肤病变分类面临成像条件差异大和缺乏临床背景的挑战，临床医生通常结合患者病史和其他病变信息进行综合评估。

Method: SLIMP通过嵌套对比学习方法，结合皮肤病变图像、个体元数据及患者级元数据（如医疗记录等），充分利用所有可用数据模态。

Conclusion: SLIMP通过整合多模态数据和模仿临床医生的综合评估方法，有效提升了皮肤病变表征学习的质量。

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态CAD重建模型，结合视觉语言模型和强化学习，在DeepCAD基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD重建方法通常仅支持单一输入模态（如点云、图像或文本），限制了通用性和鲁棒性。本文旨在通过多模态输入提升设计应用的普及性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：1) 在大规模程序生成数据上进行监督微调（SFT）；2) 使用在线反馈通过强化学习（RL）微调，探索GRPO等在线RL算法。

Result: SFT模型在三种输入模态上均优于单模态方法；RL微调后，模型在三个挑战性数据集（包括真实场景）上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 多模态输入与RL微调的结合显著提升了CAD重建性能，为设计工具民主化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

TL;DR: MAGREF提出了一种基于多参考主题的视频生成统一框架，通过掩码引导实现连贯的多主题视频合成，并在生成质量和多主题一致性方面取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于多参考主题的视频生成在多主题一致性和生成质量方面仍面临挑战，MAGREF旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAGREF采用区域感知动态掩码机制和像素级通道连接机制，灵活处理多主题推理并保留外观特征。

Result: MAGREF在视频生成质量上达到最先进水平，能够从单主题训练泛化到复杂多主题场景，并优于现有开源和商业基线。

Conclusion: MAGREF为可扩展、可控且高保真的多主题视频合成铺平了道路，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,
controllable, and high-fidelity multi-subject video synthesis. Code and model

TL;DR: SOYO是一个轻量级框架，通过高斯混合压缩器和域特征重采样器改进参数隔离增量学习中的域选择，提升动态环境下的模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在动态变化的现实数据分布中表现不佳，现有参数隔离增量学习方法在域和类别增加时参数选择准确性不足。

Method: 提出SOYO框架，包含高斯混合压缩器(GMC)、域特征重采样器(DFR)和多级域特征融合网络(MDFN)，支持多种参数高效微调方法。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，SOYO在图像分类、目标检测和语音增强等任务上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SOYO在复杂动态环境中展现出鲁棒性和适应性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent
superiority over existing baselines, showcasing its robustness and adaptability
in complex, evolving environments. The codes will be released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrustVLM是一个无需训练的框架，旨在解决视觉语言模型(VLM)预测可信度评估的关键挑战，通过利用图像嵌入空间提高误分类检测，显著提升模型可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型(VLM)在多模态理解和生成方面表现出色，但在零样本和迁移学习场景中仍容易产生自信但错误的预测，这在安全关键领域可能带来严重后果。

Method: 提出TrustVLM框架，利用VLM中的模态差距和图像嵌入空间中概念表示的差异性，设计了一种新颖的置信度评分函数来改进误分类检测。

Result: 在17个不同数据集、4种架构和2种VLM上的实验表明，TrustVLM在AURC、AUROC和FPR95等指标上达到最先进性能，最高提升51.87%、9.14%和32.42%。

Conclusion: TrustVLM通过无需重新训练的方式提高了VLM的可靠性，为实际应用中的安全部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出Spatial-MLLM框架，通过双编码器架构从纯2D观察中实现空间推理，无需依赖3D数据，并在多个数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在2D视觉任务上表现优异，但在空间智能方面仍有提升空间。现有3D模型依赖额外3D或2.5D数据，限制了仅含2D输入场景的应用。

Method: 采用双编码器架构：预训练2D视觉编码器提取语义特征，空间编码器（基于视觉几何模型）提取3D结构特征，通过连接器整合为统一视觉标记。推理时使用空间感知帧采样策略选择关键帧。

Result: 在多种真实世界数据集上的实验表明，Spatial-MLLM在视觉空间理解和推理任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Spatial-MLLM框架有效提升了基于纯2D输入的空间推理能力，为多模态大语言模型的空间智能发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

TL;DR: LADA方法通过在冻结的CLIP图像编码器后添加轻量级标签特定记忆单元，解决了持续学习中参数选择错误导致性能下降的问题，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的持续学习方法通过添加多组可学习参数来适应预训练的图像编码器，但推理时需要选择预期参数，容易出错并降低性能。

Method: LADA在冻结的CLIP图像编码器后添加轻量级标签特定记忆单元，通过聚合任务无关知识生成判别性特征，并使用特征蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: LADA在持续学习设置中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LADA通过避免参数分割和干扰冻结的CLIP参数，有效提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: TimePoint是一种自监督方法，通过从合成数据中学习关键点和描述符，显著加速了基于DTW的时间序列对齐，并提高了对齐精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态时间规整（DTW）作为时间序列对齐的标准方法，存在可扩展性差和对噪声敏感的问题，因此需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: TimePoint结合了1D微分同胚和全卷积/小波卷积架构，从合成数据中提取关键点和描述符，然后应用DTW进行稀疏表示对齐。

Result: 实验表明，TimePoint在速度和精度上均优于标准DTW，且仅需合成数据训练即可泛化到真实时间序列，进一步微调后效果更佳。

Conclusion: TimePoint提供了一种可扩展的时间序列分析解决方案，显著提升了DTW的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球科学多模态学习基准在系统覆盖面和评估维度上存在局限，仅关注孤立子系统且任务少于16个，无法全面评估跨圈层交互。

Method: 整合卫星和实地观测数据，通过专家团队（每圈层2-5人）制定评估维度，众包标注（40人辅助），采用四层标注体系（感知→思维链推理），并通过混合专家-众包流程验证。

Result: 测试9个前沿MLLM模型，最高准确率不足35%，GPT-4o在跨圈层任务中表现甚至降至0%。

Conclusion: OmniEarth-Bench为地学AI设立了新标准，可推动环境监测与灾害预测领域的科学发现与实际应用。数据与模型已开源。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

TL;DR: 论文提出Qwen-LookAgain（Qwen-LA）模型，通过视觉-文本反射过程减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，并引入BRPO方法平衡反射次数与长度，实验证明其能有效提升准确性并降低幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在长推理过程中视觉信息关注度下降，易引发幻觉问题。仅依赖文本反射不足以抑制幻觉，因此需要一种新方法来增强视觉信息的重新关注。

Method: 提出Qwen-LA模型，采用视觉-文本反射过程，结合BRPO强化学习方法平衡反射决策，并通过Visual Token COPY和ROUTE机制强制模型在视觉层面重新关注信息。

Result: 在多个视觉问答数据集和幻觉指标上的实验表明，Qwen-LA在保持高准确性的同时显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: Qwen-LA通过视觉-文本反射和视觉信息补充机制，有效解决了VLMs在长推理中的幻觉问题，为视觉语言推理模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在概率测度空间上最小化非凸泛函的问题，通过相对熵（KL散度）进行正则化，并探讨了熵正则化的非凸-非凹极小极大问题。利用最佳响应流（Best Response flow）分析了其收敛性，展示了如何选择正则化器以使最佳响应算子成为收缩映射，从而保证唯一全局最小解的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文的动机是扩展最佳响应流在凸优化问题中的应用，研究其在非凸泛函优化中的有效性，特别是在强化学习中的策略优化问题。

Method: 论文采用最佳响应流方法，结合相对熵正则化，分析非凸泛函的优化问题。通过调整正则化参数和参考测度的尾部行为，确保最佳响应算子的收缩性。

Result: 结果表明，通过适当选择正则化器，最佳响应算子可以成为收缩映射，从而保证唯一固定点的存在，该固定点即为优化问题的唯一全局最小解。

Conclusion: 论文成功将最佳响应流应用于非凸优化问题，并展示了其在强化学习策略优化中的潜在应用，为非凸优化提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of
probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with
respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of
solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize
the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play
flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the
degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the
regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In
particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex
functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with
respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of
its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer
for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best
Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by
the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with
arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely
how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a
specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy
optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax
parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

TL;DR: 本文改进了随机重排（RR）和单次重排（SS）策略在非光滑（强）凸函数上的收敛性分析，证明其比近端梯度下降（Proximal GD）更快，并首次在一般凸情况下给出了RR采样方案的后缀平均的（近乎）最优收敛结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管随机重排梯度方法在实践中易于实现且表现良好，但其理论理解仍有限。Liu & Zhou (2024b) 的最新研究首次在多种设置下建立了最后一次迭代收敛结果，但对非光滑（强）凸函数的收敛速度仅与近端梯度下降相当。本文旨在改进这一局限，证明随机重排策略在非光滑情况下的优势。

Method: 本文通过分析随机重排（RR）和单次重排（SS）策略，改进了非光滑（强）凸函数上的最后一次迭代收敛性分析，并与近端梯度下降（Proximal GD）进行比较。

Result: 研究证明，RR和SS策略在非光滑（强）凸函数上的收敛速度均快于Proximal GD，并首次在一般凸情况下给出了RR采样方案的后缀平均的（近乎）最优收敛结果，与Koren等人（2022）的下界匹配。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析证实了随机重排策略在非光滑优化问题中的优势，为实际应用提供了理论支持，并填补了相关领域的理论空白。

Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular
algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in
which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one
whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In
contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the
theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou,
2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various
settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex
optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions
are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved
last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used
Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies
are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of
randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal
convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling
scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et
al., 2022).

Motivation: 传统一阶优化方法的步长选择通常依赖经验或试错，缺乏理论保障。本文旨在建立通过在线学习自动调整步长的理论框架，以提升收敛性能并解释超梯度下降等启发式方法的有效性。

Method: 提出OSGM框架：1) 用收敛度量构造反馈函数评估步长效果 2) 通过在线学习算法动态调整步长 3) 确保收敛速率不差于最优固定步长

Result: OSGM在光滑凸问题上实现：1) 轨迹依赖的全局收敛 2) 强凸问题的改进复杂度 3) 局部超线性收敛。成为继拟牛顿法后第二个具有非渐近超线性收敛的一阶方法族。

Conclusion: OSGM为自适应步长选择提供了理论框架，不仅获得优越收敛性，还解释了超梯度下降等启发式方法的成功原因，扩展了一阶优化方法的能力边界。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled
gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt
stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the
effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence
measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning
algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that
are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable
convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1)
trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an
improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local
superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order
methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated
quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the
popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRT路径规划方法在高复杂度环境中存在搜索空间大、路径质量低和收敛慢的问题，难以满足灾害响应等高要求应用的需求。

Method: 提出VLM-RRT方法，利用视觉语言模型分析环境快照提供初始方向引导，优化RRT采样过程，提高采样效率和路径质量。

Result: 通过大量定量和定性实验验证，VLM-RRT方法显著提升了路径规划的效率和质量。

Conclusion: VLM-RRT方法有效结合视觉语言模型和RRT算法，为无人机路径规划提供了更高效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region
or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional
pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster
response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these
limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely
to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path
quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various
state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

Motivation: 传统计算机视觉系统在开放世界中识别不熟悉物体及其对任务规划的相关性时存在困难，而LLMs虽然能提供有用见解，但也可能产生错误或不安全的建议。因此，需要一种机制来确保在不确定性下的安全和合理决策。

Method: 论文提出了一种结合LLMs和认知护栏的方法，通过设计和模拟这些护栏，并在实际搜救任务中进行集成，来指导sUAS群的决策过程。

Conclusion: 通过集成LLMs和认知护栏，可以显著提高sUAS群在开放世界环境中的自主决策能力和任务安全性，为未来的搜救和灾害响应任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these
settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and
autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often
struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer
their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large
language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications.
While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations
and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure
safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must
be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design,
simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in
search-and-rescue missions.

Result: 该方法无需重新训练或微调，能够准确检测语义上有意义的异常，适用于非结构化环境导航。

Conclusion: 通过分析-合成方法和扩散模型，实现了高效的像素级异常检测，为机器人导航提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb
control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in
dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged
mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise
coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified
reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills
involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and
striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes
real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between
simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.
Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement
learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification
techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a
variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock
trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise
strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged
mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Conclusion: 策略移动化方法成功地将导航与操作解耦，无需额外演示数据即可提升策略的适应性，为移动平台上的精确操作任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实验发现Q学习智能体可能形成超竞争定价，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在为无限重复博弈中的这种现象提供首个理论框架。

Method: 建立无限重复博弈模型，假设企业仅根据观测利润更新定价策略（不计算均衡策略），分析Q函数在实验结束阶段满足特定不等式时的情况。引入单记忆子博弈完美均衡新类别。

Result: 当博弈同时存在单阶段纳什均衡价格和合谋可行价格时，Q学习会使企业持续采取超竞争定价。揭示了天真合谋、冷酷触发策略和递增策略支持学习行为的条件。

Conclusion: Q学习在特定条件下会自发产生超竞争定价，其中冷酷触发策略能构成子博弈完美均衡，而天真合谋仅在合谋价本身为纳什均衡时成立。

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to
charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation
for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing
policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium
strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium
price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies
certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently
charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame
perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior
is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing
strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the
collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger
policies can.

TL;DR: exLong框架利用LLM自动生成异常行为测试(EBTs)，解决开发者偏向测试正常路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者通常优先测试正常路径，而忽视异常场景，导致代码对异常事件的处理不足。

Method: exLong基于CodeLlama微调的大语言模型，分析异常抛出轨迹、条件表达式及相似路径的非异常测试。

Result: 演示视频显示exLong能有效帮助开发者创建全面的EBTs。

Conclusion: exLong填补了异常测试的自动化空白，提升了代码健壮性。

Abstract: Exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) are crucial in software development for
verifying that code correctly handles unwanted events and throws appropriate
exceptions. However, prior research has shown that developers often prioritize
testing "happy paths", e.g., paths without unwanted events over exceptional
scenarios. We present exLong, a framework that automatically generates EBTs to
address this gap. exLong leverages a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from
CodeLlama and incorporates reasoning about exception-throwing traces,
conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional
behavior tests that execute similar traces. Our demonstration video illustrates
how exLong can effectively assist developers in creating comprehensive EBTs for
their project (available at https://youtu.be/Jro8kMgplZk).

high costs and limited scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce
OSS-UAgent, an automated, configurable, and interactive agent-based usability
evaluation framework specifically designed for open source software. Our
framework employs intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to

knowledge bases, OSS-UAgent ensures accurate and context-aware code generation.
The generated code is automatically evaluated across multiple dimensions,

Motivation: 现有的SWE-bench及其变体在评估大语言模型修复软件错误的能力时存在局限性，如更新不及时、覆盖范围窄、依赖人工操作等，这些问题影响了基准的可扩展性并可能导致过拟合和数据污染。

Method: 论文提出了SWE-bench-Live，一个动态更新的基准测试，包含1,319个来自2024年GitHub问题的任务，覆盖93个代码库，每个任务配有Docker镜像以确保可重复执行。通过自动化流程减少人工干预，支持持续更新。

Result: 实验表明，现有的大语言模型和代理框架在SWE-bench-Live上的表现与静态基准测试（如SWE-bench）相比存在显著差距，即使在受控评估条件下也是如此。

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live提供了一个动态、多样且可执行的基准测试，有助于在大语言模型和代理框架的动态、真实世界软件开发环境中进行严格且抗污染的评估。

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our

Conclusion: 研究证实强化学习能有效教导LLM自我提升代码效率，为实时优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but
often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world
deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative
optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where
LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an
execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy
Optimization~(GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark
show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO,
using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously
optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to
62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from
31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency
improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly
self-improve code efficiency.

safe development and deployment of AI systems. Although AI governance is a core
pillar of Responsible AI, current literature still lacks synthesis across such
governance frameworks and practices. Objective: To identify which frameworks,
principles, mechanisms, and stakeholder roles are emphasized in secondary
literature on AI governance. Method: We conducted a rapid tertiary review of
nine peer-reviewed secondary studies from IEEE and ACM (20202024), using
structured inclusion criteria and thematic semantic synthesis. Results: The
most cited frameworks include the EU AI Act and NIST RMF; transparency and
accountability are the most common principles. Few reviews detail actionable
governance mechanisms or stakeholder strategies. Conclusion: The review
consolidates key directions in AI governance and highlights gaps in empirical
validation and inclusivity. Findings inform both academic inquiry and practical
adoption in organizations.

Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories
as the likely source of the performance degradation.
