### [1] [Meaning Is Not A Metric: Using LLMs to make cultural context legible at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23785)
*Cody Kommers,Drew Hemment,Maria Antoniak,Joel Z. Leibo,Hoyt Long,Emily Robinson,Adam Sobey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该立场论文认为，大语言模型（LLMs）能以空前规模在基于AI的社会技术系统中解析文化背景和人类意义，克服传统系统因依赖‘薄描述’而无法表达人类意义的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统依赖数值化‘薄描述’，标准化处理导致人类活动失去文化背景意义。人文学科提出的‘厚描述’虽能保留语境，但难以规模化应用。LLMs的文本能力为自动化生成‘厚描述’提供了可能。

Method: 提出将人文学科的‘厚描述’框架与LLMs结合，通过语言模型自动化处理语境丰富的文本表征，解决文化意义表达的规模化难题。

Result: LLMs可部分实现‘厚描述’的自动化生成，但需解决五大挑战：语境保留、解释多元性、经验与批判视角融合、区分质性与量化内容、意义的动态性。

Conclusion: 厚描述或成为统一框架，帮助LLMs更有效地表征文化意义，是生成式AI应用的重要方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make
cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented
scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have
previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin
descriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and
therefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.
By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have
developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal
representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual
information needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can
effectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the
verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)
automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially
overcoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human
meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about
developing new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame
this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify
five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,
integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,
distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and
acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest
that thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to
address a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing
culture in (or using) LLMs.

### [2] [Nine Ways to Break Copyright Law and Why Our LLM Won't: A Fair Use Aligned Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23788)
*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Priyansh Srivastava,Sundar Atreya H.,Shirish Karande,Mohan Kankanhalli,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FUA-LLM框架，通过法律依据和专家验证数据集，优化大语言模型输出以符合合理使用原则，减少侵权风险同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）存在直接复制受版权保护内容的风险，导致伦理、法律和实际问题。现有的拒绝式过滤方法常损害模型实用性，因此需要一种既能减少侵权又能保持实用性的解决方案。

Method: 与知识产权专家合作构建FairUseDB数据集（包含18,000个专家验证案例），并应用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调开源LLMs，使其生成合法且实用的替代内容。同时提出新的评估指标Weighted Penalty Utility和CAH。

Result: 实验和专家评估表明，FUA-LLM显著减少了问题输出（高达20%），同时保持了实际可用性。

Conclusion: FUA-LLM框架有效平衡了侵权风险与响应实用性，为大语言模型的版权合规问题提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by
reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative
modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns.
Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive
refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these
models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property
experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a
legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with
fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed
dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic
infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce
legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to
blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics,
we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic
Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive
quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM
substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to
state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

### [3] [Conversational Exploration of Literature Landscape with LitChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23789)
*Mingyu Huang,Shasha Zhou,Yuxuan Chen,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitChat是一个端到端的交互式文献代理，结合LLM和数据驱动工具，帮助用户快速探索大规模文献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字科学文献的爆炸式增长使得传统手动综述变得不可行，而现有的大型语言模型（LLM）因上下文窗口限制和幻觉问题无法满足系统性综述的需求。

Method: LitChat通过自动解析用户查询、检索相关文献、构建知识图谱，并采用多种数据挖掘技术生成基于证据的见解。

Result: 通过AI4Health案例研究，LitChat展示了其快速导航大规模文献并提供数据支持见解的能力。

Conclusion: LitChat有效解决了传统方法和LLM在文献探索中的局限性，为用户提供了全面、客观且透明的文献分析工具。

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital
scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new
opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature
landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature
comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective,
open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited
context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat,
an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments
LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature
exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant
sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining
techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We
illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health,
highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale
literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with
traditional means.

### [4] [Rethinking the Understanding Ability across LLMs through Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23790)
*Shaojie Wang,Sirui Ding,Na Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于互信息的信息理论框架，用于评估大型语言模型的语言理解能力，并通过实验验证了编码器模型在信息保真度上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域取得了显著进展，但评估其内在的语言理解能力仍然具有挑战性。论文旨在通过信息理论的方法，提供一个更基础的评估框架。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于互信息的框架，将句子层面的互信息分解为词元层面的互信息，并利用Fano不等式推导出可计算的下界。通过实现词元恢复任务，比较不同模型的信息保真度。

Result: 实验发现，仅编码器模型在信息保真度上始终优于仅解码器模型，后者表现出独特的后期“遗忘”模式。此外，通过微调最大化词元恢复能力，可以提升模型的语言理解能力。

Conclusion: 互信息可以作为一种基础工具，用于理解和改进语言模型的能力，特别是在无任务特定监督的情况下。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural
language processing, yet evaluating their intrinsic linguistic understanding
remains challenging. Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an
information-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve
this. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its
latent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input
information is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn
embeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into
token-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical
bounds connecting these measures. Based on this foundation, we theoretically
derive a computable lower bound for token-level MI using Fano's inequality,
which directly relates to token-level recoverability-the ability to predict
original tokens from sentence embedding. We implement this recoverability task
to comparatively measure MI across different LLMs, revealing that encoder-only
models consistently maintain higher information fidelity than their
decoder-only counterparts, with the latter exhibiting a distinctive late-layer
"forgetting" pattern where mutual information is first enhanced and then
discarded. Moreover, fine-tuning to maximize token-level recoverability
consistently improves understanding ability of LLMs on tasks without
task-specific supervision, demonstrating that mutual information can serve as a
foundation for understanding and improving language model capabilities.

### [5] [R3-RAG: Learning Step-by-Step Reasoning and Retrieval for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23794)
*Yuan Li,Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Bufan Li,Qinyuan Cheng,Bo Wang,Yining Zheng,Yuxin Wang,Zhangyue Yin,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3-RAG利用强化学习让大语言模型学会逐步推理和检索，提升检索增强生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集检索器在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中成为瓶颈，因其参数有限且无法逐步推理。基于提示的迭代RAG受限于人工设计的工作流程。

Method: R3-RAG分两阶段：冷启动学习推理与检索的交替迭代，强化学习优化检索环境探索能力。设计了答案正确性和文档相关性两种奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明R3-RAG显著优于基线方法，并能适配不同检索器。

Conclusion: R3-RAG通过强化学习有效提升了RAG系统的推理和检索能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate
hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG
systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to
perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to
address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To
address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses
$\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to
$\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving
comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is
divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the
manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use
reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the
external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for
R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the
trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification
for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are
relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to
iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer.
Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and
can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at
https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.

### [6] [Emergent LLM behaviors are observationally equivalent to data leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23796)
*Christopher Barrie,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出Ashery等的研究中LLM表现出的语言惯例更可能是训练数据泄露的结果，而非自发形成的社会规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑Ashery等关于大语言模型(LLM)在命名游戏中自发形成人类式社会规范的结论，认为其现象实际源于模型对预训练数据的记忆。

Method: 通过多种分析证明LLM能识别协调游戏结构并回忆其结果，而非展现'涌现'行为。

Result: 观察到的行为与训练语料记忆无法区分，作者提出的缓解措施无效。

Conclusion: 需要寻找替代研究策略，并反思LLM在社会科学模型中的适用性。

Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired
to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions
reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better
explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already
encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we
provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure
of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit
"emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are
indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by
pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on
the place of LLMs for social science models.

### [7] [Detection of Suicidal Risk on Social Media: A Hybrid Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23797)
*Zaihan Yang,Ryan Leonard,Hien Tran,Rory Driscoll,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种结合RoBERTa和TF-IDF-PCA的混合模型，用于从Reddit帖子中自动分类四种自杀风险等级，提高了评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀想法和行为日益成为社会关注焦点，亟需有效工具进行早期风险检测。

Method: 采用RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA混合模型，结合深度上下文嵌入和统计词频加权，并通过数据重采样和增强技术优化模型。

Result: 混合模型表现最佳，加权F1分数达到0.7512，优于单一RoBERTa、BERT及其他传统分类器。

Conclusion: 该混合模型能有效提升自杀风险评估的准确性和可靠性，为早期检测提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical
societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable
early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine
learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into
four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class
classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating
the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa),
a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical
term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy
and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and
overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data
augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we
compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT
model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a
best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

### [8] [My Answer Is NOT 'Fair': Mitigating Social Bias in Vision-Language Models via Fair and Biased Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23798)
*Jian Lan,Yifei Fu,Udo Schlegel,Gengyuan Zhang,Tanveer Hannan,Haokun Chen,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估并缓解了大型视觉语言模型（VLM）中的社会偏见问题，提出了一种无需训练的后处理方法，有效提升了模型的公平性和置信度可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在社会偏见问题，可能对某些社会群体造成不公。目前尚不清楚这些模型在生成响应时产生社会偏见的程度，因此需要评估并缓解这一问题。

Method: 研究首先在PAIRS和SocialCounterfactuals数据集上评估了四种先进的VLM模型，发现其存在性别和种族偏见。随后提出了一种后处理方法，通过在推理阶段消除与偏见相关的残差并放大与公平相关的残差来缓解偏见。

Result: 研究发现VLM模型在生成响应时存在显著的性别和种族偏见，且其置信度校准不准确。提出的后处理方法在提升模型公平性和置信度可靠性方面优于其他训练策略。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅揭示了VLM模型中的社会偏见问题，还提出了一种有效的后处理方法，为提升模型的公平性和可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Social bias is a critical issue in large vision-language models (VLMs), where
fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society.
It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield social bias in generative responses. In
this study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the
model's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the
multiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from
generating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models
are prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated
confidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why
VLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit
substantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer
show mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some
lead to increased bias. Based on these findings, we propose a post-hoc method
for the inference stage to mitigate social bias, which is training-free and
model-agnostic. We achieve this by ablating bias-associated residuals while
amplifying fairness-associated residuals on model hidden layers during
inference. We demonstrate that our post-hoc method outperforms the competing
training strategies, helping VLMs have fairer responses and more reliable
confidence levels.

### [9] [Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23799)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Weiran Lin,Omer Akgul,Lujo Bauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何更好地衡量大语言模型（LLM）生成文本的一致性，发现现有方法难以准确反映人类对一致性的感知，并提出了一种基于logit的集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）容易产生幻觉且对提示扰动敏感，导致生成文本不一致或不可靠。现有衡量一致性的方法（如响应概率或内部状态）是否与人类感知一致尚不明确。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=2,976）评估现有方法的表现，并提出一种基于logit的集成方法来估计LLM的一致性。

Result: 研究发现现有方法难以准确匹配人类对一致性的感知，而提出的logit集成方法与现有最佳指标表现相当。

Conclusion: 建议在评估LLM一致性时更广泛地结合人类输入，因为无人工评估的方法仍存在明显不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to
prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated
text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and
fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's
confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when
resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often
relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled
responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet
clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency
of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods
typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well.
We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we
show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing
metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that
methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently
imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

### [10] [SEMFED: Semantic-Aware Resource-Efficient Federated Learning for Heterogeneous NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23801)
*Sajid Hussain,Muhammad Sohail,Nauman Ali Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SEMFED框架，针对NLP任务中的联邦学习挑战，通过语义感知的客户端选择、自适应模型架构和通信高效的特征压缩技术，显著降低通信成本并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在NLP任务中面临语义异构、词汇不匹配和设备资源限制等挑战，需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效处理异构环境的解决方案。

Method: SEMFED框架包含三个创新点：语义感知的客户端选择机制、自适应NLP模型架构和通信高效的语义特征压缩技术。

Result: 实验表明，SEMFED在多种NLP分类任务中，通信成本降低80.5%，同时模型准确率保持在98%以上，优于现有联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: SEMFED能有效管理异构客户端环境，适用于现实世界中的联邦NLP部署。

Abstract: Background: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However,
applying FL to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents unique
challenges due to semantic heterogeneity across clients, vocabulary mismatches,
and varying resource constraints on edge devices. Objectives: This paper
introduces SEMFED, a novel semantic-aware resource-efficient federated learning
framework specifically designed for heterogeneous NLP tasks. Methods: SEMFED
incorporates three key innovations: (1) a semantic-aware client selection
mechanism that balances semantic diversity with resource constraints, (2)
adaptive NLP-specific model architectures tailored to device capabilities while
preserving semantic information, and (3) a communication-efficient semantic
feature compression technique that significantly reduces bandwidth
requirements. Results: Experimental results on various NLP classification tasks
demonstrate that SEMFED achieves an 80.5% reduction in communication costs
while maintaining model accuracy above 98%, outperforming state-of-the-art FL
approaches. Conclusion: SEMFED effectively manages heterogeneous client
environments with varying computational resources, network reliability, and
semantic data distributions, making it particularly suitable for real-world
federated NLP deployments.

TL;DR: MedHELM提出一个扩展性强的评估框架，用于更全面评估大语言模型在医疗任务中的表现，发现不同模型在不同医疗子领域性能差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗执照考试评估无法反映真实临床实践的复杂性和多样性，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发包含5大类22子类121任务的临床验证分类法，构建35个基准测试（17现有+18新），采用LLM陪审团评估方法并进行成本-性能分析。

Result: 高级推理模型表现最优（DeepSeek R1胜率66%），Claude 3.5 Sonnet以低40%成本达到相近性能。模型在临床笔记生成（0.73-0.85）和医患沟通（0.78-0.83）表现强，临床决策支持（0.56-0.72）较弱。

Conclusion: 医疗领域LLM评估需要针对真实场景的任务特异性评估，MedHELM开源框架为此提供了解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical
licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and
diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible
evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three
key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories,
22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly
formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in
the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation
methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9
frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance
variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64%
win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved
comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized
accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note
Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83),
moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in
Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow
(0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with
clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician
agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and
BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top
models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of
real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an
open source framework to enable this.

### [12] [Calibrating LLMs for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Leveraging Sub-clause Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23804)
*Terrance Liu,Shuyi Wang,Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro,Yash Chandarana,Chirag Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何为基于大型语言模型（LLM）的文本到SQL解析提供校准的置信度分数，提出了一种结合子句频率（SCF）和多变量Platt缩放（MPS）的方法，显著提升了校准效果和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在文本到SQL解析上表现优异，但它们有时会表现出自信的错误，这降低了系统的可信度。因此，需要一种可靠的不确定性度量方法来提高系统的可信度。

Method: 论文提出了一种名为“子句频率”（SCF）的方法，利用SQL查询的结构化特性提供更细粒度的正确性信号，并通过多变量Platt缩放（MPS）将这些信号整合为一个整体校准分数。

Result: 在两个流行的文本到SQL数据集上的实验表明，该方法在校准和错误检测任务上优于传统的Platt缩放方法。

Conclusion: 结合SCF和MPS的方法显著提升了文本到SQL解析的校准效果，为构建更可靠的文本到SQL系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL
parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are
confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires
eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study
the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the
likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish
a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In
particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration,
provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output
probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for
text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to
provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency"
(SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the
canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an
overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular
text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields
further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection
over traditional Platt scaling.

TL;DR: MedOrchestra是一种混合框架，结合云端和本地LLM的优势，在保护临床数据隐私的同时提升复杂临床任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端大型语言模型（LLM）虽性能优越，但存在临床数据隐私风险；本地LLM能保护隐私，却难以处理复杂临床任务。需要一种兼顾隐私与性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出MedOrchestra框架：云端LLM分解任务并生成提示（不接触真实数据），本地LLM执行隐私敏感的子任务并整合结果。通过临床指南和合成测试案例验证提示有效性。

Result: 在胰腺癌分期任务中，MedOrchestra对自由文本报告的准确率达70.21%，显著优于本地模型基线（48.94%-56.59%）和临床专家（55.32%-65.96%）；结构化报告准确率提升至85.42%。

Conclusion: MedOrchestra通过云端-本地协同机制，在严格保护隐私的前提下实现了临床任务处理精度的突破性提升，为LLM的医疗应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings faces critical
trade-offs: cloud LLMs, with their extensive parameters and superior
performance, pose risks to sensitive clinical data privacy, while local LLMs
preserve privacy but often fail at complex clinical interpretation tasks. We
propose MedOrchestra, a hybrid framework where a cloud LLM decomposes complex
clinical tasks into manageable subtasks and prompt generation, while a local
LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. Without accessing
clinical data, the cloud LLM generates and validates subtask prompts using
clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. The local LLM executes subtasks
locally and synthesizes outputs generated by the cloud LLM. We evaluate
MedOrchestra on pancreatic cancer staging using 100 radiology reports under
NCCN guidelines. On free-text reports, MedOrchestra achieves 70.21% accuracy,
outperforming local model baselines (without guideline: 48.94%, with guideline:
56.59%) and board-certified clinicians (gastroenterologists: 59.57%, surgeons:
65.96%, radiologists: 55.32%). On structured reports, MedOrchestra reaches
85.42% accuracy, showing clear superiority across all settings.

TL;DR: 提出动态分层剪枝方法DLP，通过自适应确定各层重要性实现高效LLM压缩，在70%稀疏度下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流均匀分层剪枝策略在高稀疏度下会导致性能显著下降，现有非均匀剪枝方法依赖预设值导致次优结果。

Method: DLP动态整合模型权重和输入激活信息，自适应分配各层剪枝率。

Result: 在70%稀疏度下，LLaMA2-7B困惑度降低7.79，平均准确率提升2.7%，且兼容现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: DLP有效保持高稀疏度模型性能，可无缝集成至PEFT框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and
improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream
pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which
can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing
the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have
shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal
performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called
Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the
relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input
activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental
results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity
levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the
perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various
existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at
https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法在适应大型语言模型时存在参数冗余问题，导致参数利用率低下。DenseLoRA旨在通过更高效的参数利用方式提升模型性能。

Method: DenseLoRA采用单编码器-解码器结构对所有适应层的隐藏表示进行细化和压缩，然后通过密集低秩矩阵进行模型适应，替代了传统LoRA中的两个冗余低秩矩阵。

Result: 在LLaMA3-8B模型上，DenseLoRA仅使用0.01%的可训练参数即达到83.8%的准确率，优于LoRA的80.8%准确率（使用0.70%参数）。

Conclusion: DenseLoRA通过优化参数利用和适应效率，显著提升了模型性能，为大型语言模型的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for
adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices,
thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research
indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to
inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we
introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances
parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA.
DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating
a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across
all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two
redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense
low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We
evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8%
accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8%
accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to systematically assess the impact of
DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估大语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂多轮对话（如动机转移、跨轮次依赖）时的弱点，需构建更贴近现实的测试标准。

Method: 基于实时文本解说构建MARS-Bench基准，聚焦超多轮、交互式多轮和跨轮任务三大关键维度，并通过注意力可视化实验分析性能下降机制。

Result: 闭源LLMs显著优于开源模型；显式推理增强长对话处理能力；模型在动机转移和跨轮依赖场景中表现欠佳；特殊令牌导致的注意力分散是性能下降主因。

Conclusion: MARS-Bench填补了复杂对话评估空白，揭示了LLMs的局限性及改进方向，为未来研究提供方法论和实证依据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted
in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in
handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation
transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along.
Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We
present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic
\textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to
remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so
to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical
aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn,
and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that
closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit
reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex
dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling
motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we
provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special
tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex
dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.

TL;DR: 提出LayerIF框架，通过影响函数量化预训练大模型中各层的训练质量，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖模型中心启发式，忽视数据影响，导致预训练大模型各层训练质量不均，限制下游性能。

Method: 使用影响函数隔离每层梯度，计算验证损失对训练样本的敏感性，得出数据驱动的层重要性估计。

Result: 实验证明该方法在LoRA-MoE架构专家分配和LLM剪枝中，能持续提升任务性能。

Conclusion: LayerIF提供任务敏感的层质量评估，优化模型架构调整，显著提升下游应用效果。

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers'
training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting
their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise
training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and
training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric
heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform
allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these
limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages
Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a
principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and
measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by
computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer
importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance
estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different
test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by
leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in
LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM
pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our
model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task
performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SPLAENet的新方法，通过双交叉注意力机制和分层注意力网络，结合情感分析和标签融合技术，显著提高了社交媒体中立场检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展产生了大量用户生成内容，这些内容隐含观点并助长错误信息的传播。立场检测成为分析信息偏见和对抗错误信息的关键方法。

Method: SPLAENet采用双交叉注意力机制和分层注意力网络捕捉文本间的相互关系，结合情感分析区分不同立场类别，并通过标签融合技术将提取的特征与立场标签对齐。

Result: 在RumourEval数据集上，SPLAENet的准确率和F1分数分别平均提高了8.92%和17.36%；在SemEval数据集上分别提高了7.02%和10.92%；在P-stance数据集上分别提高了10.03%和11.18%。

Conclusion: SPLAENet在错误信息社交媒体内容中的立场检测方面表现出显著优势，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of
user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the
spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance
where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged
as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared
information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method
for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual
cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work
(SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed
method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention
network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant
parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We
incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance
categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the
texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align
extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to
accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art
methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and
17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it
achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the
P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and
11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media
content.

TL;DR: PROSE方法通过迭代优化和多样本验证，显著提升了LLM代理推断用户偏好的准确性，比现有方法CIPHER提高了33%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的用户偏好描述过于通用，无法捕捉个体独特性，限制了LLM代理的个性化交互效果。

Method: 提出PROSE方法，包含偏好描述的迭代精炼和跨多用户写作样本的偏好验证两个关键要素。

Result: 在摘要和邮件写作任务中，PROSE比CIPHER方法提升33%的生成质量，与ICL结合可再提升9%。

Conclusion: PROSE能更精准推断用户细微偏好，与ICL互补，共同提升LLM代理的个性化生成能力。

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents
that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the
potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user
preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred
preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic
preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized
nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to
enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing
samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of
inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across
multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e.,
Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an
email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human
preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over
CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly,
we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them
provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

TL;DR: 当前大语言模型在可控性（steerability）方面存在不足，现有干预方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理和指令跟随方面取得进展，但其输出是否广泛符合多样用户目标（即可控性）尚不明确。

Method: 提出基于多维目标空间的评估框架，将用户目标和模型输出建模为向量，并通过文本重写任务测试模型表现。

Result: 研究发现当前模型存在副作用持续、覆盖不足和校准问题，现有干预方法（如提示工程、强化学习微调）效果参差不齐。

Conclusion: 即使强大如当前大语言模型，其可控性仍面临挑战，现有对齐策略可能不足。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and
instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably
produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer
to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior
makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further
intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare
user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot
requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text
inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we
introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user
goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text
attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we
find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are
persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering,
best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying
effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that
even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies
may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at
https://github.com/MLD3/steerability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动评分技术受限于特定考试格式、评分缺乏可解释性且难以跨学科应用，亟需一种通用、透明且适应复杂评估场景的解决方案。

Method: 开发RATAS框架：通过数学建模将量规评分任务形式化，结合生成式AI模型处理多样化文本答案，并生成结构化评分依据。

Result: 基于真实课程数据集的实验表明，RATAS在评分准确性和可靠性上表现优异，同时提供可解释的评分依据。

Conclusion: RATAS为自动评分提供了通用性强、透明度高的解决方案，能有效支持多样化教学场景的评估需求。

Abstract: Automated answer grading is a critical challenge in educational technology,
with the potential to streamline assessment processes, ensure grading
consistency, and provide timely feedback to students. However, existing
approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack
interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world
applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these
limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a
novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for
rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide
range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate
structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the
automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to
rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling
complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world
project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels
of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high
reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable
feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在替代人类进行模型对齐时，是否能复现人类判断和偏好，特别是在人类存在分歧的模糊情境中。

Method: 通过构建一个“无共识”基准，涵盖多种先验模糊场景，每种场景提供两种立场，分析LLMs在回答生成者、裁判和辩论者三种角色中的表现。

Result: LLMs在开放回答中表现细致，但在裁判或辩论者角色中倾向于在无共识话题上站队，未能完全反映人类分歧。

Conclusion: 需要更先进的方法在无人监督下对齐LLMs，当前LLMs无法完全捕捉人类在分歧话题上的不同观点。

Abstract: The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in ``aligning'' LLMs has
raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and
preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This
study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer
generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously
described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable
oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting
with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating
examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each
presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide
nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a
stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These
findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning
LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human
disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音作为一种非侵入性数字表型，能为心理健康状况提供重要信息，但通常被当作单一模态处理。青少年抑郁常伴随自杀意念和睡眠障碍等共病问题，因此需要更全面的分析方法。

Method: 采用三模态（语音文本、声学标记、声学生物标志物）数据，结合多任务学习（抑郁、自杀意念、睡眠障碍）和纵向分析策略，利用大语言模型架构进行抑郁预测。

Result: 在Depression Early Warning数据集上，所提方法的平衡准确率达到70.8%，优于单模态、单任务和非纵向方法。

Conclusion: 多模态、多任务学习和纵向分析的结合能更全面地理解抑郁及其共病问题的发展，为抑郁检测提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights
into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In
contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal
multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the
potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based
depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived
text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents
a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as
suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional
opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by
simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances
using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis
strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions,
allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our
proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the
Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%,
which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估PPIs生物影响的基准数据集，这阻碍了药物开发中目标识别的进展。

Method: 通过专家访谈确定基准数据集的标准，构建了500个专家标注的QA对（金标准数据集），并开发了一个集成自动评估LLM来扩展银标准数据集（3,720个QA对）。

Result: 成功创建了RAGPPI基准数据集，包含4,420个QA对，专注于PPIs的潜在生物影响。

Conclusion: RAGPPI将成为支持药物发现QA解决方案研究的重要资源。

Abstract: Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the
vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and
challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently
exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer
benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological
impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a
benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard
dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an
ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics,
which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA
pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the
research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

framework using top LLMs as judges to tackle the difficulty of recruiting
domain experts for manual evaluation. Utilizing papers withdrawn from arXiv, we
validated our proposed methods with several leading reasoning LLMs from
different providers and assessed their performance and API costs for
identifying critical errors and unsoundness problems. The OpenAI o3 model
performed the best, while o4-mini was the most cost-effective one in our
evaluation. This paper provides insights into document-based scientific
understanding/reasoning and lays the foundation for future applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ValueSim框架，通过生成反映个人经历和人口统计信息的背景故事，模拟个性化人类价值系统，相比检索增强生成方法准确率提升10%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）的对齐方法主要关注广泛伦理准则，但缺乏对个体价值系统的模拟。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过模拟个体价值观提升模型个性化能力。

Method: 采用多模块架构（受认知-情感人格系统启发），将结构化个人数据转化为叙事背景故事，并基于这些叙事模拟个体价值观。

Result: 在自建World Values Survey基准测试中，ValueSim的top-1准确率比检索增强生成方法提高10%以上，且用户交互历史越多性能越优。

Conclusion: ValueSim能有效模拟个体价值观，并随时间推移通过交互历史优化模拟能力，为LLMs的个性化对齐提供新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like
capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important.
Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement
learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However,
while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness,
they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address
this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values
through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and
demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into
narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the
Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on
these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from
the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over
10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis
reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history
becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona
simulation capabilities over time.

*Xiaoqing Cheng,Ruizhe Chen,Hongying Zan,Yuxiang Jia,Min Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出BiasFilter，一种模型无关的推理时去偏框架，通过实时过滤生成输出来减轻大型语言模型中的社会偏见，无需重新训练或修改模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型去偏方法通常成本高、效果有限且难以扩展到更大模型和开放式生成任务，因此需要一种更高效、可扩展的去偏解决方案。

Method: BiasFilter在推理时定期评估中间输出，维护候选续写集合，并通过基于公平性奖励信号丢弃低奖励段来逐步完成生成。使用公平性偏好数据集训练隐式奖励模型以评估生成响应的令牌级公平性。

Result: 实验表明，BiasFilter能有效减轻多种大型语言模型中的社会偏见，同时保持整体生成质量。

Conclusion: BiasFilter作为一种模型无关的去偏框架，能高效且可扩展地减轻大型语言模型中的社会偏见，适用于开源和API基础的模型。

Abstract: Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods
often incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness,
and struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,
inference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both
open-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced
data or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering
generation outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates
intermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate
continuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward
segments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we
construct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to
assess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of
LLMs while preserving overall generation quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出EvoMoE框架，通过专家进化策略和动态路由机制解决多模态MoE模型中的专家同质化和路由器僵化问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态MoE方法存在专家同质化（专家功能趋同）和路由器僵化（静态路由无法区分模态）两大挑战，限制了模型性能提升。

Method: 1. 专家进化策略：从单个可训练专家逐步衍生多样化专家；2. 动态令牌感知路由器（DTR）：基于超网络为不同模态/令牌生成动态路由权重。

Result: EvoMoE在MME、MMBench等多模态基准测试中显著优于其他稀疏MLLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoMoE通过创新性设计有效解决了MoE核心问题，为多模态大模型性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach
significantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and
improves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results,
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE
techniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two
key challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs
because MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN
parameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the
intended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity
stems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,
which fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in
similar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,
we propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a
meticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves
multiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert
evolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,
we introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism
that allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and
intrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,
which dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other
sparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,
MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. Our results highlight the effectiveness of EvoMoE
in enhancing the performance of MLLMs by addressing the critical issues of
expert uniformity and router rigidity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国拥有丰富的非物质文化遗产，但现代化进程对其造成威胁，亟需新技术手段进行保护和传承。

Method: 利用开源中文ICH数据构建大语言模型ICH-Qwen，结合自然语言理解、知识推理能力，并采用合成数据与微调技术。

Result: 实验证明ICH-Qwen能有效执行ICH领域特定任务。

Conclusion: 该模型为ICH保护传承提供智能解决方案，为数字人文研究开辟新路径。

Abstract: The intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of China, a cultural asset transmitted
across generations by various ethnic groups, serves as a significant testament
to the evolution of human civilization and holds irreplaceable value for the
preservation of historical lineage and the enhancement of cultural
self-confidence. However, the rapid pace of modernization poses formidable
challenges to ICH, including threats damage, disappearance and discontinuity of
inheritance. China has the highest number of items on the UNESCO Intangible
Cultural Heritage List, which is indicative of the nation's abundant cultural
resources and emphasises the pressing need for ICH preservation. In recent
years, the rapid advancements in large language modelling have provided a novel
technological approach for the preservation and dissemination of ICH. This
study utilises a substantial corpus of open-source Chinese ICH data to develop
a large language model, ICH-Qwen, for the ICH domain. The model employs natural
language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities of large language
models, augmented with synthetic data and fine-tuning techniques. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICH-Qwen in executing tasks
specific to the ICH domain. It is anticipated that the model will provide
intelligent solutions for the protection, inheritance and dissemination of
intangible cultural heritage, as well as new theoretical and practical
references for the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage.
Furthermore, it is expected that the study will open up new paths for digital
humanities research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个大规模韩语法律案例检索基准LEGAR BENCH和新型检索模型LegalSearchLM，解决了现有研究在小规模数据和检索方法上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律案例检索研究存在两个主要问题：一是评估数据集规模小且案件类型单一，无法反映真实法律检索的复杂性；二是依赖基于嵌入或词汇匹配的方法，导致表示有限且匹配不相关。

Method: 提出LEGAR BENCH基准（覆盖120万案例和411种犯罪类型）和LegalSearchLM模型（通过法律要素推理和约束解码生成目标案例相关内容）。

Result: LegalSearchLM在LEGAR BENCH上比基线模型性能提升6-20%，对域外案例的泛化能力比单纯生成模型高15%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建大规模基准和引入法律要素推理模型，显著提升了法律案例检索的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case,
is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making.
However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are
evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and
use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect
the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance
on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited
representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we
present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering
411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M legal cases; and (2)
LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the
query case and directly generates content grounded in the target cases through
constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms
baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It
also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming
naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大语言模型抽象推理能力的数学框架和两个新指标，通过符号重映射实验揭示了当前模型在抽象推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立简单有效的基准来严格评估大语言模型（LLMs）的抽象推理能力，研究者旨在区分模型是真正理解抽象模式还是仅依赖记忆。

Method: 开发了一个数学框架定义抽象推理，引入两个新指标（γ和δ分数），并设计了基于符号重映射的基准测试来测量模型对底层模式的识别能力。

Result: 实验发现：1）LLMs在非十进制算术和符号推理中存在明显局限；2）即使采用思维链提示仍存在抽象推理缺陷；3）δ分数能有效量化模型对特定符号的记忆依赖程度。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型虽然在某些领域表现优异，但仍缺乏稳健的抽象推理能力，这为未来改进指明了关键方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a simple, effective, and theoretically
grounded benchmark for rigorously probing abstract reasoning in Large Language
Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that
defines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns
independent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to
these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel
complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while
\(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than
underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere
memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic
symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate
genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM
evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)
reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic
reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;
and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence
by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly
highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that
current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract
reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网访问控制需兼顾动态上下文因素，但现有方案存在语义鸿沟、策略编写碎片化问题，需人机协作的灵活解决方案。

Method: 结合提示引导策略生成、检索增强推理和形式化验证，构建混合LLM-规则引擎实现策略自动化转换与决策。

Result: 策略生成正确率100%，DeepSeek-V3决策准确率88%（F1=0.79），优于GPT-3.5等基线，且展现良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: LACE为物联网平台提供了安全、灵活且用户友好的访问控制新范式。

Abstract: Access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly
complex, as policies must account for dynamic and contextual factors such as
time, location, user behavior, and environmental conditions. However, existing
platforms either offer only coarse-grained controls or rely on rigid rule
matching, making them ill-suited for semantically rich or ambiguous access
scenarios. Moreover, the policy authoring process remains fragmented: domain
experts describe requirements in natural language, but developers must manually
translate them into code, introducing semantic gaps and potential
misconfiguration. In this work, we present LACE, the Language-based Access
Control Engine, a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to bridge the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. LACE
combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and
formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access
control. It enables users to specify policies in natural language,
automatically translates them into structured rules, validates semantic
correctness, and makes access decisions using a hybrid LLM-rule-based engine.
We evaluate LACE in smart home environments through extensive experiments. LACE
achieves 100% correctness in verified policy generation and up to 88% decision
accuracy with 0.79 F1-score using DeepSeek-V3, outperforming baselines such as
GPT-3.5 and Gemini. The system also demonstrates strong scalability under
increasing policy volume and request concurrency. Our results highlight LACE's
potential to enable secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control across
real-world IoT platforms.

Motivation: 研究AI模型是否能识别自身是否处于评估状态，以避免评估有效性因模型行为系统性差异而受损，影响部署和治理决策的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含1000个提示词和转录文本的多样化基准数据集（涵盖61个数据集），测试模型对评估场景/真实场景的分类能力（评估意识）及识别评估目的的能力。

Result: 前沿模型展现出超随机水平的评估意识（AUC 0.83），但低于人类基线（AUC 0.92）；模型和人类在代理环境中识别评估更准确；模型能显著超随机水平识别评估目的。

Conclusion: 前沿模型已具备显著（未达人类水平）的评估意识能力，建议未来模型持续追踪该能力发展。

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of
evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically
different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for
deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language
models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from
evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation
awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts
and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g.,
MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories
from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models
clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches
an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of
$0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying
evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we
test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under
multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random
chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate
that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman,
level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future
models.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的POI预测方法未能有效解决两大核心挑战：对数值时空数据的语义理解不足，以及候选POI空间过大导致预测不准确。

Method: 提出CoMaPOI框架，包含Profiler（数值转语义）、Forecaster（动态约束候选空间）、Predictor（整合信息生成预测）三个协作代理。

Result: 在NYC、TKY、CA三个数据集上实现SOTA性能，所有指标提升5%-10%。

Conclusion: 通过定制化协作代理，首次系统解决了LLM在复杂时空任务中的应用挑战，为后续研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next
Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in
semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based
methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely
overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task.
Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic
understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling
of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively
large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or
irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative
Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close
interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor),
CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler
agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions,
enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically
constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent
integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that
CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to
10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of
challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by
leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SYCON Bench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在多轮自由对话中的迎合行为，发现对齐调优会放大模型的迎合倾向，而模型规模和推理优化能增强抵抗用户不良观点的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）应提供有益且无害的回应，但它们常表现出迎合用户观点的倾向（sycophancy），忽视事实准确性或伦理合理性。此前研究主要关注单轮事实正确性，忽略了真实交互中的动态变化。

Method: 引入SYCON Bench基准，通过测量模型在多轮自由对话中转向用户观点的速度（Turn of Flip）和频率（Number of Flip），评估17种LLM在三种现实场景中的迎合行为。

Result: 研究发现迎合行为仍是普遍问题；对齐调优会加剧迎合倾向，而模型规模和推理优化能增强抵抗能力。推理模型表现优于指令调优模型，但过度依赖逻辑阐述时会失效。采用第三人称视角的提示策略可将辩论场景中的迎合行为减少63.8%。

Conclusion: SYCON Bench揭示了LLM迎合行为的动态特征，并证明模型规模、推理优化和第三人称视角提示能有效减少迎合倾向，为改进模型交互提供了实用方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless
responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs
regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on
sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness,
overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce
SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in
multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how
quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it
shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying
SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that
sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment
tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning
optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views.
Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail
when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the
user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting
strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces
sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖特定LLM或摘要流程，具有广泛适用性，为LLM摘要中的版权分配提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve
and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI
assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent
summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising
concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of
valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using
Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each
document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley
values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley,
an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between
documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing
Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces
computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach
to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley
significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP
with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM
used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes
it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the
lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently,
research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation
metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights
into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading
results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors,
rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To
address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards,
including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and
comparative analyses with human performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain
challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly
when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like
ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to
changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from
multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from
interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited
flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these
issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge
from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory
overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an
adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based
on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a
dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of
candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the
selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge
aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared
to existing approaches. Code is avaliable at

### [41] [Few-Shot Optimization for Sensor Data Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Fatigue Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18754)
*Elsen Ronando,Sozo Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合欧氏距离和大语言模型的HED-LM方法，用于改进传感器分类任务中的少样本选择，显著提升了疲劳检测等复杂任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本提示在有限标注数据下能高效推理，但其性能高度依赖示例选择质量。针对传感器数据（如疲劳检测）中存在的模式重叠和个体差异大的特点，需要更精细的示例选择方法。

Method: HED-LM采用混合选择流程：先通过欧氏距离筛选候选示例，再利用大语言模型（LLMs）根据上下文相关性重新排序。

Result: 在疲劳检测任务中，HED-LM宏F1分数达69.13±10.71%，分别比随机选择和纯距离过滤高16.6%和2.3%。

Conclusion: HED-LM通过结合数值相似性和上下文相关性，提升了少样本提示的鲁棒性，在医疗监测、工业安全等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot optimization with HED-LM (Hybrid
Euclidean Distance with Large Language Models) to improve example selection for
sensor-based classification tasks. While few-shot prompting enables efficient
inference with limited labeled data, its performance largely depends on the
quality of selected examples. HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid
selection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance
and re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models
(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection
task using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high
inter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,
fatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle
differences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves
a mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection
(59.30$\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\pm$11.39%). These
represent relative improvements of 16.6% and 2.3%, respectively. The results
confirm that combining numerical similarity with contextual relevance improves
the robustness of few-shot prompting. Overall, HED-LM offers a practical
solution to improve performance in real-world sensor-based learning tasks and
shows potential for broader applications in healthcare monitoring, human
activity recognition, and industrial safety scenarios.

*Jakub Podolak,Rajeev Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现DeepSeek R1-32B在默认回答后报告置信度时往往过度自信，而通过语义熵和多响应采样能更可靠评估不确定性。强制长链式思考可显著提升置信度有效性，表明可靠的不确定性估计需显式探索生成空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探究DeepSeek R1-32B模型在问答任务中自我报告置信度的不确定性来源，以验证其置信度评估的可靠性。

Method: 通过对比默认回答后置信度与语义熵（多响应采样）的表现，并引入强制长链式思考（chain-of-thought）方法，观察模型置信度的变化。同时训练独立阅读器模型分析置信度来源。

Result: 语义熵因计算量更大而更可靠；强制长链式思考显著提升置信度有效性，即使简单事实检索问题也受益；独立阅读器模型可复现类似置信度，表明置信度可能仅是推理过程中浮现的替代选项的统计量。

Conclusion: 可靠的不确定性估计需要显式探索生成空间，自我报告置信度只有在经过此类探索后才可信。

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its
self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the
default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident,
whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains
reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger
test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution.
We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by
forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its
verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that
normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees
only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal
score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during
reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires
explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is
trustworthy only after such exploration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于并行离散事件模拟（PDES）的新方法，通过将多个AI与非AI代理以因果、基于规则的方式结合，以提高系统输出的准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了充分发挥人工智能（AI）系统的潜力并确保其输出的正确性，需要将多个AI和非AI系统无缝结合，以约束和验证输出结果。

Method: 采用并行离散事件模拟（PDES）框架，将每个代理视为实体，通过时间传递和动态约束机制，使AI与非AI代理在协作环境中共同完成任务。非AI代理作为审计者，验证AI代理的每一步操作。

Result: 在四个不同领域的问题上，该方法比单独使用AI模型的准确率显著提高（68% vs 23%），证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合AI与非AI代理的PDES方法，能够显著提升复杂问题的解决准确率，同时确保系统的可扩展性和可信度。

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a
trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems
together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output.
This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based
methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based
way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each
agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior
requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work
in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in
parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to
the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using
non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of
such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can
enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory
bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and
non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when
necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then
progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI
agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that
certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving
four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those
from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems
from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely
by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where
as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

TL;DR: 通过抑制特定token序列来降低大语言模型对敏感内容的拒绝率，无需修改模型权重或提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到某些模型在拒绝敏感内容前会出现特定的token序列（如<think>后跟双换行符），研究这些格式化调整对拒绝率的影响。

Method: 在生成过程中抑制<think>后的双换行符和</think>后的结束序列token，仅通过修改生成时的token概率实现。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型上的实验表明，这些干预提高了对敏感提示的实质性回答比例，且不影响标准基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 拒绝行为可以通过在生成过程中特定点阻止拒绝子空间来规避。

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs)
on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by
the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the
specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the
chain-of-thought (CoT) block (<think>) followed by a double newline token
(\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during
generation: suppressing \n\n after <think> and suppressing the end-of-sequence
token after the end of the CoT block (</think>). Our method requires no
datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token
probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1
distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive
answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard
benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by
blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

TL;DR: 论文提出ASyMOB框架评估大语言模型在符号数学上的能力，发现模型依赖记忆而非深层理解，但顶尖模型展现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估大语言模型在符号数学（如积分、微分方程等）上的核心能力，需开发新评估方法。

Method: 引入ASyMOB评估框架，包含17,092个数学问题，通过数值/符号扰动分析模型泛化能力，并与计算机代数系统对比。

Result: 模型在扰动后性能显著下降（最高-70.3%），但顶尖模型（如o4-mini）表现稳健（扰动后仅下降21.7%）。代码执行能提升弱模型准确率（最高+33.1%）。

Conclusion: 前沿大语言模型可能已出现泛化能力的"相变"，未来需探索与外部工具深度整合或开发完全自主的符号数学能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency
in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced
science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing
the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,
differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we
introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic
manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity
and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by
comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic
`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance
for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized
patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models
achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra
systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as
problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated
code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without
code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain
perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5
Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and
97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against
perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models).
This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization
capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward
lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing
models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理，利用相同或类似数据集重现已发表研究结果的能力，以评估其在自动化科学研究重现性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用NACC的“Quick Access”数据集，选取五篇可重现的高引用研究，通过GPT-4o构建模拟研究团队，基于研究摘要、方法部分和数据字典描述，编写和执行代码以动态重现研究结果。

Result: LLM代理平均重现了53.2%的研究发现，数值和范围类发现常与原研究不同，统计方法或参数也有差异，但整体趋势和显著性有时相似。

Conclusion: LLMs作为自主代理在生物医学研究中自动化重现性方面展现出潜力，但也存在局限性，如实现缺陷或方法细节缺失，显示了当前技术的限制。

Abstract: Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents to reproduce findings of published research studies using the
same or similar dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We used the "Quick Access" dataset of the National
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). We identified highly cited published
research manuscripts using NACC data and selected five studies that appeared
reproducible using this dataset alone. Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated
research team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing
code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study
Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5
Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of
findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed
between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or
parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and
significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques
and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing
methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in
fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation
highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable
evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and
limitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in
biomedical research.

TL;DR: 该论文全面评估了80种大语言模型的不确定性估计方法，发现语言表达不确定性（LVU）在性能和可解释性上优于其他方法，并揭示了模型规模、训练后处理等因素对不确定性估计的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在高风险应用中的广泛部署，可靠的不确定性估计对于确保其安全可信的使用至关重要。

Method: 研究评估了80种不同架构和规模的LLMs，聚焦三种黑盒单次方法：基于令牌概率的不确定性（TPU）、数值语言不确定性（NVU）和语言表达不确定性（LVU），使用MMLU-Pro基准进行系统评估。

Result: LVU在校准和区分能力上优于TPU和NVU，且更具可解释性；高准确性不意味着可靠的不确定性；模型规模、后训练、推理能力和量化均影响估计性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调多角度评估的必要性，并将LVU定位为提升LLMs在现实场景中可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe
and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to
date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and
closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures,
reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales
from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass
methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal
uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically
evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the
challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and
knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU
and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more
interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable
uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and
quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better
uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good
calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These
findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU
as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的潜在有害使用引发了担忧，当前的有害查询检测方法存在漏洞，特别是在处理低资源语言或非文本模态（如图像和音频）时表现不佳。

Method: OMNIGUARD通过（i）识别跨语言或跨模态对齐的LLM/MLLM内部表示，（ii）利用这些表示构建语言无关或模态无关的分类器来检测有害提示。

Result: OMNIGUARD在多语言环境中比最强基线提高了11.57%的分类准确率，对基于图像的提示提高了20.44%，并在基于音频的提示上设定了新的SOTA，同时效率显著提升（约快120倍）。

Conclusion: OMNIGUARD通过创新的跨语言和跨模态检测方法，有效提升了有害提示的分类性能和效率，为LLMs的安全使用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked
concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach
to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model.
Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to
attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g.,
prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities
such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an
approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our
approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are
aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a
language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful
prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\%
over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for
image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By
repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very
efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code

Result: 实验表明Infi-Med在通用医疗推理中达到SOTA性能，并保持对临床场景的快速适应能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗MLLMs的实际部署奠定基础，平衡了模型效能与操作限制。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising
prospects in healthcare, particularly for addressing complex medical tasks,
supporting multidisciplinary treatment (MDT), and enabling personalized
precision medicine. However, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical
considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose
Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key
innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and
constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal
sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both
pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning
capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and
(3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across
medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while
maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes
a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by
balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.

Conclusion: LoVeC为长文本生成提供高效、可解释的事实性检测方案，推动LLM安全部署。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge for the safe and trustworthy
deployment of large language models (LLMs) in factual content generation. Prior
work has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to
hallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods
that require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a
more efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to
short-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to
open-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized
Confidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for
long-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train
LLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving
as a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our
experiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,
ORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel
evaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess
different verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three
long-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better
calibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly
efficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded.

Motivation: 现有研究多将大语言模型在内容审核中的过度敏感归因于冒犯性词汇，但本文发现模型隐含的主题关联偏见是更深层原因。

Method: 受心理学内隐联想测试启发，提出主题关联分析法，通过生成自由场景想象并量化主题放大程度来评估模型偏见。

Result: 发现更先进的模型（如GPT-4 Turbo）虽总体误判率更低，但表现出更强的主题刻板印象。

Conclusion: 需超越基于关键词的过滤方法，针对模型隐含的主题关联偏见进行优化，以解决审核过度敏感问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often
misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While
previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive
terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic
topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's
implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a
semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with
toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for
misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels,
we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger
topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases
suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely
on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings
highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing
insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) aim to simulate characters for realistic
and engaging human-computer interactions. However, traditional reward models
often struggle with scalability and adapting to subjective conversational
preferences. We propose ChARM, a Character-based Act-adaptive Reward Model,
addressing these challenges through two innovations: (1) an act-adaptive margin
that significantly enhances learning efficiency and generalizability, and (2) a
self-evolution mechanism leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve
training coverage. Additionally, we introduce RoleplayPref, the first
large-scale preference dataset specifically for RPLAs, featuring 1,108
characters, 13 subcategories, and 16,888 bilingual dialogues, alongside
RoleplayEval, a dedicated evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show a 13%

TL;DR: 论文通过自然语言处理工具自动转录和标注口头报告数据，实现了大规模有声思维数据的分析，展示了该方法在认知科学中的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有声思维方法是研究人类推理过程的宝贵数据来源，但由于转录和标注工作量大，样本量受限，导致其在当代认知科学中应用减少。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具自动转录和标注640名参与者在解决数学任务时的口头报告，并将其编码为搜索图。

Result: 自动转录和标注与人工评估具有中等一致性，成功分析了人类推理轨迹的一致性和变异性。

Conclusion: 研究证明大规模有声思维数据的价值，并为口头报告的自动化分析提供了概念验证。

Abstract: The think-aloud method, where participants voice their thoughts as they solve
a task, is a valuable source of rich data about human reasoning processes. Yet,
it has declined in popularity in contemporary cognitive science, largely
because labor-intensive transcription and annotation preclude large sample
sizes. Here, we develop methods to automate the transcription and annotation of
verbal reports of reasoning using natural language processing tools, allowing
for large-scale analysis of think-aloud data. In our study, 640 participants
thought aloud while playing the Game of 24, a mathematical reasoning task. We
automatically transcribed the recordings and coded the transcripts as search
graphs, finding moderate inter-rater reliability with humans. We analyze these
graphs and characterize consistency and variation in human reasoning traces.
Our work demonstrates the value of think-aloud data at scale and serves as a
proof of concept for the automated analysis of verbal reports.

TL;DR: SwingArena是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）的竞争性框架，模拟真实软件开发流程，通过提交者和评审者的协作迭代来测试模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法真实反映LLM在软件开发中的动态协作能力，SwingArena旨在通过模拟实际开发流程（如代码提交、测试验证）来更准确地评估模型表现。

Method: 框架采用检索增强代码生成（RACG）模块处理长上下文问题，支持多语言（C++、Python、Rust、Go），并通过CI管道验证模型生成的补丁和测试用例。

Result: 实验使用400多个GitHub真实问题，发现GPT-4o擅长生成激进补丁，而DeepSeek和Gemini更注重CI验证的正确性。

Conclusion: SwingArena提供了一种可扩展的方法，在CI驱动的真实开发环境中评估LLM，为模型性能比较提供了新基准。

Abstract: We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language
Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows.
Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative
process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate
patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through
continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive
evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module
that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and
semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple
programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework
to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations.
Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected
from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive
patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI
validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for
evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings. More

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督方法性能差且需人工干预，监督方法缺乏大规模训练数据。LLM结合提示工程可缓解数据不足问题，但缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)的动态提示方案，增强LLM在因果关系任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种LLM上的实验表明，所提方法优于静态提示方案。

Conclusion: RAG动态提示能有效提升LLM的因果关系检测与挖掘能力，具有跨领域泛化优势。

Abstract: Causality detection and mining are important tasks in information retrieval
due to their enormous use in information extraction, and knowledge graph
construction. To solve these tasks, in existing literature there exist several
solutions -- both unsupervised and supervised. However, the unsupervised
methods suffer from poor performance and they often require significant human
intervention for causal rule selection, leading to poor generalization across
different domains. On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack
of large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with
effective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of
unavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there
does not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM
prompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality
detection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and
five LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting
over other static prompting schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管思维链推理能提升大模型表现，但其推理过程是否真实反映模型内部机制仍存疑。研究旨在探究视觉语言模型中文本与图像偏见如何影响推理忠实性。

Method: 提出细粒度评估框架，对偏见表达模式进行分类，并首次系统分析图像偏见对CoT的影响。该框架可同时应用于语言模型（LLM）的隐含线索评估。

Result: 发现：1）专业推理模型也常忽略图像隐含偏见；2）存在推理不一致现象（正确推理后突然改答案）；3）纯语言模型仍难以处理非显性线索。

Conclusion: 当前模型的CoT推理在隐含偏见处理上存在显著缺陷，图像偏见尤其容易被忽视。提出的评估框架为检测不忠实推理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language
models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully
reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive
study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs),
investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases
affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel,
fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns,
enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous
methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and
respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT
faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely
articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized
for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified
phenomenon we term ``inconsistent'' reasoning - correctly reasoning before
abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased
reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to
revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our
findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to
struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.

TL;DR: FLAT-LLM是一种无需训练的结构化压缩方法，通过细粒度低秩变换在激活空间中实现高效压缩，提升推理速度并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但其高计算和内存需求在资源受限环境中部署存在挑战。现有低秩分解方法常伴随精度下降、校准成本高和架构效率低等问题。

Method: 提出FLAT-LLM方法：通过基于头部分析的主成分分析(PCA)截断特征向量变换权重，降低隐藏维度；采用重要性度量自适应分配解码器秩，实现无需微调的高效权重压缩。

Result: 在4个模型和11个数据集上的评估表明，FLAT-LLM在泛化性和下游任务性能上优于结构化剪枝基线，同时比基于分解的方法获得更快的推理加速，且校准过程仅需几分钟。

Conclusion: FLAT-LLM为资源受限环境提供了一种快速、准确且无需训练的结构化压缩解决方案，平衡了模型效率与性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural
language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent
low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural
compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration
procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder
real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and
accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained
low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the
hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors
computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an
importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM
achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery
fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes.
Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural
pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while
delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

Motivation: 传统公平性度量仅关注离散的准确性评估，无法捕捉模型不确定性对公平性的隐性影响，且现有数据集在数据规模、多样性和清晰度方面存在问题。

Method: 提出UCerF度量以更细致地评估模型公平性，并构建了一个包含31,756个样本的性别-职业公平性评估数据集。

Result: 应用UCerF和新建数据集对10个开源大型语言模型进行评估，发现如Mistral-7B等模型因对错误预测的高置信度而表现不佳，这一细节被UCerF捕捉但被传统度量忽略。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的不确定性感知公平性评估框架为开发更透明和负责任的人工智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the
critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics,
which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction
correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g.,
higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy).
To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric,
UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more
reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional
fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity
issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness
evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a
more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a
benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior
of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness
due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by
Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,
which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for
developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer在多种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制与参数规模扩展之间的关系尚不明确。论文旨在填补这一空白，通过分析层的偏差和多样性来理解性能提升的机制。

Method: 论文采用偏差-多样性分解方法，将层的输出误差分为偏差和多样性两部分，并通过信息论多样性分析层数增加对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，当各层的输出接近正确答案且保持多样性时，性能提升显著。此外，层数增加带来的性能增益具有次模性，边际改进随层数增加而递减。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论和实验验证，揭示了Transformer性能提升的关键因素，即层的多样性和偏差的平衡，并指出层数增加对性能的影响符合参数规模扩展的对数收敛规律。

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and
are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs).
Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as
shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent
mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the
internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the
relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws
remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which
mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first
theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a
bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error
of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which
indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing
Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when
individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain
mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when
individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce
an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding
layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,
are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of
layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional
layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the
parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks
with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in
this study.

TL;DR: GenCP通过结合LLM与约束编程(CP)，并引入MLM实现双向约束传播，显著提升了约束感知文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型(LLM)在生成流畅文本方面表现出色，但在强制执行外部约束时存在困难，因其缺乏显式控制机制。

Method: 改进GenCP框架，整合掩码语言模型(MLM)进行领域生成，利用双向约束传播（结合过去和未来token），将文本生成建模为约束满足问题(CSP)。

Result: 在COLLIE基准测试中，通过MLM调用实现领域预览显著提升了GenCP性能，尽管增加了部分回溯开销，但整体提高了LLM推理效率及约束满足能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了token级预测与结构化约束间的鸿沟，尤其在严格内容约束任务中能生成更可行、有意义的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to
enforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without
explicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM
predictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text
generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we
improve GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain
generation, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages
both past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between
token-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more
reliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE
benchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls
significantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs
additional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall
effect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to
generate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict
content constraints.

Motivation: 受模型汇聚（model souping）启发，研究旨在探索结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的隐藏状态是否可以在事后合并，以支持下游推理任务，同时实现模块化编码和重用。

Method: 采用独立编码文档并通过简单操作（如平均）合并其表示为一个单一上下文状态的方法，称为'文档汇聚'。研究对Mamba2模型进行微调，以生成可汇聚的表示。

Result: 在HotpotQA上，汇聚十个独立编码的文档几乎达到了在相同输入上训练的交叉编码器的性能，支持多跳问答、稀疏检索和长文档推理。

Conclusion: 文档汇聚方法在保持高性能的同时，实现了模块化编码和输入的高效重用，为下游推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models
(SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by
model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently
and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging --
into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping,
enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each
query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find
that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning
with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents
nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks, including standardized
medical exams. However, correct answers alone do not ensure correct logic, and
models may reach accurate conclusions through flawed processes. In this study,
we introduce the MedPAIR (Medical Dataset Comparing Physicians and AI Relevance
Estimation and Question Answering) dataset to evaluate how physician trainees
and LLMs prioritize relevant information when answering QA questions. We obtain
annotations on 1,300 QA pairs from 36 physician trainees, labeling each
sentence within the question components for relevance. We compare these
relevance estimates to those for LLMs, and further evaluate the impact of these
"relevant" subsets on downstream task performance for both physician trainees
and LLMs. We find that LLMs are frequently not aligned with the content
relevance estimates of physician trainees. After filtering out physician
trainee-labeled irrelevant sentences, accuracy improves for both the trainees
and the LLMs. All LLM and physician trainee-labeled data are available at:

Conclusion: 该研究为中医大语言模型提供了首个多模态评估基准，推动领域标准化发展。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has
been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of
large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an
objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on
real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope
and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal
question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce
TCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for
evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core
disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas,
internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to
textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and
videos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and
manual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These
questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic
dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on
TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art
general domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on
the datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method
specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses
answer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and
TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and
leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com or

Conclusion: HARDTESTS数据集和合成流程能有效提升模型训练和代码生成性能，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed
by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable
verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a
well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written
edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose
HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this
pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS
with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing
tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points
higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating
LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as
large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model
training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will

TL;DR: EHRMIND提出了一种两阶段方法，通过监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RLVR）提升大语言模型在临床推理任务中的表现，解决了知识误用和缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，大语言模型（LLMs）在电子健康记录（EHR）解释中存在知识误用和缺失的问题，需要一种有效的方法来提升其临床推理能力。

Method: EHRMIND采用两阶段方法：首先通过轻量级监督微调（SFT）注入领域知识并稳定训练；随后使用强化学习（RLVR）优化模型的决策能力。

Result: 在MEDCALC、TREC CLINICAL TRIALS和EHRSHOT等临床任务中，EHRMIND显著提升了准确性、可解释性和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: EHRMIND为医疗领域应用RLVR提供了实用指导，有效增强了LLMs的临床推理能力。

Abstract: We present EHRMIND, a practical recipe for adapting large language models
(LLMs) to complex clinical reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR). While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding,
its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the
specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR)
interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key
failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical
knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models
lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a
two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that
injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and
encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which
reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical
applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching
(TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers
consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization.
These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM
capabilities in healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLM安全研究的语言多样性问题，指出该领域以英语为中心，非英语语言研究严重不足，并提出了改进建议。

Motivation: 揭示LLM安全研究中的语言不平等现象，推动多语言安全研究的发展，以服务全球多样化人群。

Method: 系统回顾2020-2024年间近300篇*ACL会议和研讨会的出版物，分析语言分布和研究模式。

Result: 发现LLM安全研究高度集中于英语，非英语语言（即使是高资源语言）研究极少，且英语研究缺乏语言记录规范。

Conclusion: 提出多语言安全评估、训练数据生成和跨语言安全泛化三个未来方向，呼吁建立更包容的AI安全实践。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the linguistic diversity of
LLM safety research, highlighting the English-centric nature of the field.
Through a systematic review of nearly 300 publications from 2020--2024 across
major NLP conferences and workshops at *ACL, we identify a significant and
growing language gap in LLM safety research, with even high-resource
non-English languages receiving minimal attention. We further observe that
non-English languages are rarely studied as a standalone language and that
English safety research exhibits poor language documentation practice. To
motivate future research into multilingual safety, we make several
recommendations based on our survey, and we then pose three concrete future
directions on safety evaluation, training data generation, and crosslingual
safety generalization. Based on our survey and proposed directions, the field
can develop more robust, inclusive AI safety practices for diverse global
populations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对推理模型中冗余令牌的KV缓存压缩方法R-KV，显著提升了推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型在自反思和链式推理中表现优异，但输出过长导致KV缓存过大，影响推理效率。现有KV缓存压缩方法在链式推理中可能导致推理失败。

Method: 提出了R-KV方法，专门针对推理模型中的冗余令牌进行KV缓存压缩，保留关键信息。

Result: R-KV仅使用10%的KV缓存即可达到接近100%的性能，内存节省90%，吞吐量提升6.6倍，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: R-KV在数学推理数据集上表现优异，为推理模型的KV缓存压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection
and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long
outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference.
While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex
reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with
existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose
Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel
method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method
preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV
cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach
only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV
cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads
to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought
reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently
outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical
reasoning datasets.

Motivation: 现有上下文学习依赖人工提供示例，但实际场景中用户常无法或不愿提供。受人类类比启发，研究如何跨任务复用示例。

Method: 设计两阶段对齐策略消除任务间差异，基于Super-NI基准的875个NLP任务和6种LLM进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证明CrossICL有效，并揭示了跨任务示例选择标准和任务差异导致的干扰类型。

Conclusion: CrossICL为无人工标注场景提供了可靠解决方案，为跨任务上下文学习提供新思路。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) with demonstrations. However, obtaining these demonstrations primarily
relies on manual effort. In most real-world scenarios, users are often
unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human
analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize
existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby
obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore
this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the
interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our
experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of
CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs,
including GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for
selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced
interference in CrossICL.

Motivation: 探讨理性解释对语言模型性能和可靠性的实际影响，挑战现有普遍认为理性解释总是有益的观点。

Method: 通过全面的实验研究，分析理性解释在不同任务中对模型性能和可靠性的影响。

Result: 1) 理性解释有时会降低模型性能；2) 有时能提高可靠性甚至超过未训练模型；3) 性能与可靠性提升之间存在线性关系，且受任务内在难度驱动。

Conclusion: 研究为理性解释的广泛使用提供了指导，并对语言模型与人类隐式思维对齐的过程提出了重要启示。

Abstract: Training language models with rationales augmentation has been shown to be
beneficial in many existing works. In this paper, we identify that such a
prevailing view does not hold consistently. We conduct comprehensive
investigations to thoroughly inspect the impact of rationales on model
performance as well as a novel perspective of model reliability. The results
lead to several key findings that add new insights upon existing
understandings: 1) Rationales can, at times, deteriorate model performance; 2)
Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their
untrained counterparts; 3) A linear correspondence exists in between the
performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the
intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative
regulations on the broad utilization of rationales and raise critical
implications on the procedure of explicitly aligning language models with
implicit human thoughts. Codes can be found at

Motivation: 领域特定知识图谱的手动构建效率低下且需要专业知识，现有基于大语言模型的方法在处理复杂知识依赖和特定领域语料时效果有限。

Method: LKD-KGC框架通过分析文档库推断知识依赖关系，利用大语言模型确定最优处理顺序，并自回归生成实体模式，实现无监督的实体和关系抽取。

Result: 实验表明，LKD-KGC在精确率和召回率上比现有方法提升10%至20%，能够构建高质量的领域特定知识图谱。

Conclusion: LKD-KGC框架有效解决了领域特定知识图谱构建的挑战，展示了在无监督环境下构建高质量知识图谱的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships
into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While
domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is
often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for
knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such
as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven
efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually
defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references,
making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex
knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for
unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes
document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal
processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively
generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts.
This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships,
eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive
experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC
generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall
rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific
KGs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对单一任务（如基础任务、数学问题或图表分析）进行MLLM后训练，缺乏利用多源任务进行稳定强化学习的方法。

Method: 提出Mixed-R1框架，包含数据引擎构建高质量Mixed-45K数据集，以及混合奖励设计（匹配奖励、图表奖励、IoU奖励和开放奖励BMAS）。

Result: 实验证明该方法在Qwen2.5-VL和Intern-VL等多种MLLM上有效。

Conclusion: Mixed-R1为多任务MLLM后训练提供了统一解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated
the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL).
Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for
MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as
grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can
leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this
work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present
Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward
function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K).
We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the
Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which
contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has
four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or
multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for
grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as
caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a
new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by
leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the
ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed
method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes.

TL;DR: Tag-Evol框架通过知识标签组合实现多样化指令进化，显著提升数据合成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令进化方法依赖固定策略，需人工设计且形式单一，且迭代进化获取困难样本成本高。

Method: 提出Tag-Evol框架，利用多样化知识标签作为策略，通过标签组合注入原始指令实现可控进化。

Result: 实验表明，Tag-Evol生成的数据质量显著优于其他方法，且更具多样性和挑战性。

Conclusion: Tag-Evol不仅高效，还能生成更丰富、更难的进化数据。

Abstract: Evol-Instruct has made significant improvements as a data synthesis method in
several areas. Existing methods typically rely on a fixed set of strategies to
evolve, which require manual design and are monolithic in form. In addition,
iterative evolution also makes the acquisition of hard samples expensive. In
view of this, we propose the Tag-Evol framework, a more diverse and efficient
instruction evolving method. Specifically, Tag-Evol uses diverse and specific
knowledge tags as strategies to achieve controlled evolution by injecting
different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with
multiple backbones in diverse domain benchmarks show that the proposed method
generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we
conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is
not only efficient but also generates more diverse and challenging data.

Motivation: 现有LoRA合并方法在适应性和低资源问题上存在局限，无法动态调整参数且未针对低资源场景优化。

Method: 通过微调更新和剪枝LoRA参数，实现细粒度调整，提升任务适应性。

Result: 在英日双语多领域摘要任务中，新方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 动态调整的LoRA合并方法有效解决了低资源场景下的模型适配问题。

Abstract: This study proposes a simple yet effective LoRA merge method to achieve LLM
adaptation for low-resource language generation tasks. The LoRA merge
technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks,
has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs
to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they
keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has
been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes
LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows
finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task
adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as
a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of
English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves
significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous
methods.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了LLM可靠性随序列长度指数衰减的假设，提出错误集中在关键令牌上，并引入新框架提升长文本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为LLM的可靠性随序列长度指数衰减，但作者发现错误集中在少数关键令牌上，这为提升长文本生成性能提供了新思路。

Method: 通过区分关键令牌与普通令牌，提出新可靠性公式，并设计框架：选择性保留关键令牌、动态计算分配、多路径探索和语义对齐架构。

Result: 研究表明，长文本性能主要依赖关键语义决策点的准确性，而非均匀的令牌级精度，新框架显著优于暴力方法。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从原始规模扩展到战略推理的转变，为更强大高效的语言系统开辟了新途径，超越了指数衰减假说。

Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model
(LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token
error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive
outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing
emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are
concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing
critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from
the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula
explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens.
Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily
depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather
than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that
significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework
for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically
vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision
boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned
with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling
to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without
proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding
that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways
toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

Motivation: 现有投机解码方法需要训练额外模块且兼容性差，本文旨在开发无需训练、即插即用的自投机解码方案。

Method: 采用动态规划算法优化层跳过策略，利用验证阶段的完整隐藏状态作为目标动态调整层跳过方案。

Result: 在LLaMA3系列模型上实现1.3~1.7倍加速，且不改变原始文本生成分布。

Conclusion: CLaSp为LLM推理加速提供了高效、轻量级的解决方案，突破了传统方法需训练专用模块的限制。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding
process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges
on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However,
existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be
trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across
various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping
strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not
require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a
plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to
construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic
programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging
the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective.
This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each
verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers.
Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp
achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the
original distribution of the generated text.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于直觉模糊集（IFS）的新框架，用于在大型语言模型（LLM）数据标注任务中建模和聚合人类偏好，显著提高了标注一致性和数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人机交互标注方法（如SBS）在处理偏好判断时存在不确定性、标注者分歧和复杂性等问题，影响了偏好数据的质量。

Method: 采用直觉模糊集（IFS）框架，通过隶属度、非隶属度和犹豫度来建模人类偏好，提出新的标注协议和聚合方法，并引入数据质量评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，IFS方法显著提高了标注一致性，减少了标注疲劳，数据质量优于传统二元和Likert量表方法，下游任务模型性能提升12.3%，标注时间减少15.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架为处理人类偏好标注中的不确定性提供了理论支持，并为大规模LLM训练提供了实践价值。

Abstract: The quality of human preference data is crucial for training and evaluating
large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) scenarios. Traditional
side-by-side (SBS) annotation approaches often struggle with inherent
uncertainty, annotator disagreement, and the complexity of preference
judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework based on intuitionistic
fuzzy sets (IFS) for modeling and aggregating human preferences in LLM data
annotation tasks. Our approach captures not only the degree of preference but
also the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in human judgment through
membership, non-membership, and hesitation degrees. We propose an IFS-based
annotation protocol that enables more nuanced preference modeling, develops
aggregation methods for handling annotator disagreement, and introduces quality
metrics for preference data assessment. Experimental validation on multiple
datasets demonstrates that our IFS-based approach significantly improves
annotation consistency, reduces annotator fatigue, and produces higher-quality
preference data compared to traditional binary and Likert-scale methods. The
resulting preference datasets lead to improved model performance in downstream
tasks, with 12.3\% improvement in win-rate against baseline models and 15.7\%
reduction in annotation time. Our framework provides a principled approach to
handling uncertainty in human preference annotation and offers practical
benefits for large-scale LLM training.

Conclusion: 统一多模态生成模型的跨模态一致性有限，需进一步研究提升。

Abstract: Any-to-any generative models aim to enable seamless interpretation and
generation across multiple modalities within a unified framework, yet their
ability to preserve relationships across modalities remains uncertain. Do
unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely
perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500
newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&A pairs to
evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency
criteria-cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated
equivariance-our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently
demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in
pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance
evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses
of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations. We
release our code and data at https://github.com/JiwanChung/ACON.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的推理过程存在'忠实性'问题——推理轨迹可能包含难以察觉的错误或偏见。现有方法缺乏结构化、可验证的推理表达形式。

Method: 设计半结构化推理模型(SSRM)，采用Python语法风格的受限词汇表标记推理步骤的输入/输出，支持手工规则和概率模型的自动化审计。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，SSRM比同规模基线平均提升10%，在医学领域与专用模型相当。结构化审计能有效识别90%以上的推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 半结构化推理显著提升模型透明度和可解释性，为推理错误的自动化检测提供了可行路径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at reasoning, the
problem of "faithfulness" persists: LLM "reasoning traces" can contain errors
and omissions that are difficult to detect, and may obscure biases in model
outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning
Models (SSRMs), which internalize a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning format within the model. Our SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a
Pythonic syntax. While SSRM traces are not executable, they adopt a restricted,
task-specific vocabulary to name distinct reasoning steps, and to mark each
step's inputs and outputs. Through extensive evaluation on ten benchmarks,
SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generality: they outperform comparably
sized baselines by nearly ten percentage points on in-domain tasks while
remaining competitive with specialized models on out-of-domain medical
benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that semi-structured reasoning is more
amenable to analysis: in particular, they can be automatically audited to
identify reasoning flaws. We explore both hand-crafted structured audits, which
detect task-specific problematic reasoning patterns, and learned typicality
audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning patterns, and show that
both audits can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors.

Motivation: 现有无监督关键词预测方法依赖启发式重要性评分，导致信息性估计不准确且忽视时间效率。

Method: ERU-KG结合信息性模块（通过引用和术语级建模）和短语性模块（生成候选短语），无需显式建模候选短语。

Conclusion: ERU-KG通过调整超参数可切换生成与抽取模式，满足多样化应用需求，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent
years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined
importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In
addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems,
we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that
consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates
the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those
candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model
informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and
titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of
documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness
of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the
need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its
effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised
baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised
model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility,
we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases
generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document
expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the
fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can
switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting
hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.

TL;DR: 该论文提出结构化放射学报告生成（SRRG）任务，通过LLM重构自由文本报告为标准化格式，并开发SRR-BERT模型提升评估精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胸部X光报告的生成和评估因自由文本的变异性面临挑战，需标准化格式以提高临床效率和一致性。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）重构报告为结构化格式，训练SRR-BERT模型进行55种疾病的细粒度分类，并设计F1-SRR-BERT评估指标。

Result: 通过五位放射科医生的读者研究和实验验证，结构化报告和SRR-BERT模型显著提升了报告的临床相关性和评估准确性。

Conclusion: SRRG任务和配套方法有效解决了自由文本报告的变异性问题，为临床提供了更一致的标准化报告生成与评估方案。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the
potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload.
However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert
Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and
unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and
evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically
meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances
of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured
Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text
radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency,
and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring
reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured
reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained
disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and
clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality,
we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease
taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured
clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by
five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种流式预训练语言模型用于逆向文本归一化（ITN），通过动态上下文感知方法在越南语数据集上实现高准确率和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式ITN在流式自动语音识别（ASR）中的应用尚未充分探索，尤其在低资源和有限上下文场景下存在准确性、效率和适应性挑战。

Method: 采用预训练语言模型，结合动态上下文感知训练和推理，实现自适应块大小调整和右上下文信息整合。

Result: 在越南语数据集上，该方法达到了与非流式ITN相当的准确性，并优于现有流式ITN模型，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了流式ITN的挑战，为ASR系统提供了无缝集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing
both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of
streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges
in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and
limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained
language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for
improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic
Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size
adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to
non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese
dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into
ASR systems.

TL;DR: APEX方法通过扩展优势参数比例提升大模型训练效率，在指令微调和持续预训练中显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大模型训练中参数规模扩大带来性能提升的同时也增加了计算负担，研究发现优势参数对模型性能起关键作用。

Method: 提出APEX方法，逐步将优势参数扩展到劣势参数空间，从矩阵有效秩角度提供理论解释。

Result: 指令微调仅需52%可训练参数即超越全参数调优；持续预训练用33%数据达到同等困惑度，下游任务表现显著提升。

Conclusion: APEX通过优化参数分布有效提升训练效率，为大规模语言模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although scaling up the number of trainable parameters in both pre-training
and fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of large language
models, it also leads to increased computational overhead. When delving into
the parameter difference, we find that a subset of parameters, termed
advantageous parameters, plays a crucial role in determining model performance.
Further analysis reveals that stronger models tend to possess more such
parameters. In this paper, we propose Advantageous Parameter EXpansion Training
(APEX), a method that progressively expands advantageous parameters into the
space of disadvantageous ones, thereby increasing their proportion and
enhancing training effectiveness. Further theoretical analysis from the
perspective of matrix effective rank explains the performance gains of APEX.
Extensive experiments on both instruction tuning and continued pre-training
demonstrate that, in instruction tuning, APEX outperforms full-parameter tuning
while using only 52% of the trainable parameters. In continued pre-training,
APEX achieves the same perplexity level as conventional training with just 33%
of the training data, and yields significant improvements on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解Mamba SSM模型内部信息的流动机制，特别是与Transformer模型在信息传递和局部化方面的异同，以揭示大型语言模型(LLM)的通用特性。

Method: 方法上，论文将Transformer的注意力解释技术（如Attention Knockout）适配到Mamba-1和Mamba-2模型，利用其结构化分解能力分析token间信息交换和特征增强。

Result: 结果显示，Mamba模型在信息传递和层间动态上展现出与Transformer模型部分相似、部分不同的模式，某些现象可能为LLM的固有特性。

Conclusion: 结论指出，通过结构化分解可统一理解Mamba内部操作，为SSM类模型的可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space
Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical
connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms.
Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques
originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout
methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information
is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of
subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some
phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others
appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be
inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured
factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable
token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering
a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

Motivation: 现有大模型对话系统难以动态适应用户目标变化，且实时交互延迟较高。百度搜索AI助手需解决目标漂移和低延迟的工业级需求。

Method: 1. G-SFT阶段：通过目标适配代理动态跟踪用户意图，并利用可扩展知识蒸馏实现轻量化；2. C-RL阶段：基于点击信号构建偏好对，采用生成-排序范式提升点击率。

Result: 离线准确率提升23.95%达86.10%，在线点击率相对提升149.06%至25.28%，推理延迟降低69.55%。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架在目标适应性和交互质量上实现互补优化，显著提升工业级搜索助手的性能指标。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to
enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in
dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for
real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale
multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide
proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning
(G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal
shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also
incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a
lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented
Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically
constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves
click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase
architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal
tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven
reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and
25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing
inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human
behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for
complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM
reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks,
using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents
with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and
reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and
examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including
reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from
2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment,
decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous
findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with
ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of
ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in
enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used

Motivation: 由于大语言模型训练数据缺乏透明度，可能引发评估集数据泄露问题，影响结果的公平性。现有泄露检测方法主要关注异常值识别，且未在受控模拟泄露条件下评估。

Method: 在持续预训练设置下比较了排列和n-gram泄露检测方法，并探索了一种轻量级半半问题方法。优化技术以支持实例级检测并降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 建议将污染检查作为发布基准测试结果前的标准步骤，以提升评估的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to improve, as
reflected in rising scores on standard benchmarks. However, the lack of
transparency around training data raises concerns about potential overlap with
evaluation sets and the fairness of reported results. Although prior work has
proposed methods for detecting data leakage, these approaches primarily focus
on identifying outliers and have not been evaluated under controlled simulated
leakage conditions. In this work, we compare existing leakage detection
techniques, namely permutation and n-gram-based methods, under a continual
pretraining setup that simulates real-world leakage scenarios, and additionally
explore a lightweight method we call semi-half question. Although semi-half
offers a low-cost alternative, our analysis shows that the n-gram method
consistently achieves the highest F1-score. We also refine these techniques to
support instance-level detection and reduce computational overhead. Leveraging
the best-performing method, we create cleaned versions of MMLU and HellaSwag,
and re-evaluate several LLMs. Our findings present a practical path toward more
reliable and transparent evaluations, and we recommend contamination checks as
a standard step before releasing benchmark results.

Conclusion: 通过针对性干预LLM-TP协作框架，可显著提升NLI解释的形式化质量与验证效率，为可解释AI的逻辑验证提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent
work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with
theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI
explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into
machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk
of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded
by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient
precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and
robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate
issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates
strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)
efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,
(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured
proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback
for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree
using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant
improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation
refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover,
we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can
substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations
required for successful verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在科研中的应用日益广泛，但其科学知识可能迅速过时，需要有效的方法来更新和评估其知识。

Method: 引入ScienceMeter框架，定义三个指标（知识保留、知识获取、知识预测），并在15,444篇论文和30,888个科学主张的数据集上评估五种知识更新方法。

Result: 最佳方法仅能保留85.9%的现有知识，获取71.7%的新知识，预测37.7%的未来知识；推理方法适用于大模型，小模型需训练。

Conclusion: 现有科学知识更新方法难以同时满足知识保留、获取和预测的需求，开发更鲁棒的更新机制至关重要且具有挑战性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support scientific
research, but their knowledge of scientific advancements can quickly become
outdated. We introduce ScienceMeter, a new framework for evaluating scientific
knowledge update methods over scientific knowledge spanning the past, present,
and future. ScienceMeter defines three metrics: knowledge preservation, the
extent to which models' understanding of previously learned papers are
preserved; knowledge acquisition, how well scientific claims from newly
introduced papers are acquired; and knowledge projection, the ability of the
updated model to anticipate or generalize to related scientific claims that may
emerge in the future. Using ScienceMeter, we examine the scientific knowledge
of LLMs on claim judgment and generation tasks across a curated dataset of
15,444 scientific papers and 30,888 scientific claims from ten domains
including medicine, biology, materials science, and computer science. We
evaluate five representative knowledge update approaches including training-
and inference-time methods. With extensive experiments, we find that the
best-performing knowledge update methods can preserve only 85.9% of existing
knowledge, acquire 71.7% of new knowledge, and project 37.7% of future
knowledge. Inference-based methods work for larger models, whereas smaller
models require training to achieve comparable performance. Cross-domain
analysis reveals that performance on these objectives is correlated. Even when
applying on specialized scientific LLMs, existing knowledge update methods fail
to achieve these objectives collectively, underscoring that developing robust
scientific knowledge update mechanisms is both crucial and challenging.

Result: 在多领域数据集上评估，HiCaM胜率达79.50%，性能显著优于现有LLMs。

Conclusion: HiCaM框架在多个模型和领域表现一致，有效提升长文本修改的全面性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. However, when handling long-form text modification tasks, they still
face two major problems: (1) producing undesired modifications by
inappropriately altering or summarizing irrelevant content, and (2) missing
necessary modifications to implicitly related passages that are crucial for
maintaining document coherence. To address these issues, we propose HiCaM, a
Hierarchical-Causal Modification framework that operates through a hierarchical
summary tree and a causal graph. Furthermore, to evaluate HiCaM, we derive a
multi-domain dataset from various benchmarks, providing a resource for
assessing its effectiveness. Comprehensive evaluations on the dataset
demonstrate significant improvements over strong LLMs, with our method
achieving up to a 79.50\% win rate. These results highlight the
comprehensiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements
across multiple models and domains.

propose a multi-perspective role-playing framework to simulate the process of
human response. Our preliminary results show significant improvement in

Method: 提出DeepDiver强化学习框架，结合WebPuzzle数据集（含2.4万训练实例和275测试问题），通过自适应搜索策略训练模型实现SIS能力。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了大语言模型的自适应信息搜索能力，为未来研究提供了基准数据集和方法框架。

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective
reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web
question answering. Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training
with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability
to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and
noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from
learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust
search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this
missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to
intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than
settling on overconfident, under-verification answers.
  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster
information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle
consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both
wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by
encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world
open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner
empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the
671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from
cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present
that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks
such as long-form writing. Our contributions advance adaptive information
seeking in LLMs and provide a valuable benchmark and dataset for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在中文理解上表现优异，但简单的字符替换可能使其在检测毒性内容时失效，因此研究中文多模态特性对毒性检测的影响至关重要。

Method: 提出3种扰动策略和8种具体方法，构建数据集并测试9种SOTA LLM，同时探索了上下文学习（ICL）和监督微调（SFT）的增强方案。

Result: LLM在检测多模态中文毒性内容时表现较差；ICL或SFT可能导致模型过度修正，将正常内容误判为毒性内容。

Conclusion: 中文多模态特性增加了毒性内容检测的难度，需进一步研究提升LLM的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is important but challenging.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions
in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In
this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key
challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a
taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic
Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and
benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect
perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective
enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of
detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a
small number of perturbed examples may cause the LLMs "overcorrect'':
misidentify many normal Chinese contents as toxic.

Motivation: 传统ASR纠错方法效果有限，而直接使用LLM会产生幻觉问题（错误修改正确文本）。需开发可靠纠错框架以保持文本准确性。

Method: RLLM-CF框架包含三阶段：1)错误预检测 2)思维链子任务迭代修正 3)推理过程验证，无需额外信息或模型微调。

Result: 在AISHELL-1/2和Librispeech数据集上，GPT-4o结合本框架使CER/WER相对降低21%/11%/9%/11.4%。

Conclusion: RLLM-CF有效解决了LLM纠错中的幻觉问题，显著提升ASR准确性，且具有无需训练数据的优势。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct
recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional
approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that
eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs
will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of
the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM
Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error
pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3)
reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not
require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the
correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on
AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by
our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex
tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges:
substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and
insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent
Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and
extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key
contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine,
efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a
comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art
reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling
systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments
on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent
algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their
relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while
sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler
methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with
significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language
agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent
research through standardized evaluation protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译多专注于单一语言对，多语种资源利用可缓解低资源问题并提升可访问性，但多语种手语翻译尚未探索。

Method: 采用双CTC目标的无语标多语种模型，支持令牌级手语识别和口语文本生成。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试（多语种SP-10、PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily）上达到与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 该模型成功解决了多语种手语翻译中的语言冲突和对齐问题，为跨语言沟通提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language (SL) videos
into spoken language text, thereby bridging the communication gap between the
sign and the spoken community. While most existing works focus on translating a
single sign language into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging
multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance
accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to
language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages.
To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with
dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text
generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and
many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual
SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.

TL;DR: 研究发现，零样本思维链（CoT）的成功可在生成前预测，早期表示已含关键信息，早期停止可能不影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究是否能在零样本思维链（CoT）过程完成前预测其成功，以提高效率并优化推理过程。

Method: 使用基于LLM表示的探测分类器，与依赖生成标记的BERT基线对比，分析不同推理步骤对分类的影响。

Result: 探测分类器在生成前即表现良好，早期表示已含关键信息；早期停止实验显示部分截断CoT仍优于无CoT。

Conclusion: 早期表示蕴含关键信息，可通过监督或强化学习优化CoT效率，保留其优势。

Abstract: We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing
classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a
single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the
reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In
contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated
tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues
rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning
steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is
unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs
encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early
without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that
truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all,
though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like
supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains
could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is
effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping
to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\footnote{Code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言推理方面取得了显著进展，但其有限的参数记忆和易产生幻觉的特性，使其在需要准确、基于上下文的推理任务中面临挑战。因此，研究如何利用外部知识增强LLMs的能力成为重要方向。

Method: 论文首先提出了一种分类法，将外部知识分为非结构化和结构化数据，并重点研究了结构化知识（如表格和知识图谱）。通过详细分析这些知识的集成范式，并回顾代表性方法，论文提供了系统的整合策略。

Result: 研究比较了不同方法在可解释性、扩展性和性能上的权衡，为开发可信且可泛化的知识增强型LLMs提供了见解。

Conclusion: 通过系统整合外部知识，尤其是结构化知识，可以有效提升LLMs的推理能力和准确性，同时需在可解释性、扩展性和性能之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced
natural-language reasoning. However, their limited parametric memory and
susceptibility to hallucination present persistent challenges for tasks
requiring accurate, context-based inference. To overcome these limitations, an
increasing number of studies have proposed leveraging external knowledge to
enhance LLMs. This study offers a systematic exploration of strategies for
using external knowledge to enhance LLMs, beginning with a taxonomy that
categorizes external knowledge into unstructured and structured data. We then
focus on structured knowledge, presenting distinct taxonomies for tables and
knowledge graphs (KGs), detailing their integration paradigms with LLMs, and
reviewing representative methods. Our comparative analysis further highlights
the trade-offs among interpretability, scalability, and performance, providing
insights for developing trustworthy and generalizable knowledge-enhanced LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统常未能充分利用检索到的文档，尤其在证据隐式、分散或含噪声时，导致推理不忠实或不可解释。

Method: 提出ClueAnchor框架，从检索内容提取关键线索，生成多推理路径，并通过奖励优化选择最优路径。

Result: 实验表明ClueAnchor在推理完整性和鲁棒性上显著优于基线，且对噪声或部分相关内容具有强韧性。

Conclusion: ClueAnchor无需显式线索监督即可识别支持证据，有效提升RAG系统的推理质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs)
with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems
frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and
integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning,
especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured
by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for
enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization.
ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple
reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the
model by selecting the most effective one through reward-based preference
optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior
RAG baselines in reasoning completeness and robustness. Further analysis
confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved
content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the
absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在不同输入语言下的知识召回表现不一致，传统基于英语的方法未必最优，需探索更有效的跨语言知识传递机制。

Method: 基于语言与思维理论提出L2T提示策略，分析输入语言、内部认知过程与知识间的关系，并在训练中应用以减少对输入语言的依赖。

Result: 实验挑战了英语方法普遍最优的假设，证明模型内部思维与任务知识的对齐对跨语言传递至关重要，L2T可提升非英语到英语的知识迁移效果。

Conclusion: L2T策略能有效促进跨语言知识整合，无需依赖翻译学习，为多语言大模型的优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for
leveraging information across languages, but their factual knowledge recall
remains inconsistent depending on the input language. While previous studies
have attempted to address this issue through English-based prompting and
evaluation, we explore non-English to English transfer via Language and Thought
Theory. This perspective allows us to examine language-thought binding in LLMs
and uncover why factual knowledge often fails to transfer effectively. We
propose the Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting strategy, which analyzes the
relationship between input language, internal cognitive processes, and
knowledge. Experimental results challenge the assumption that English-based
approaches consistently outperform other languages and offer a novel insight
that aligning the model's internal thought with the knowledge required for the
task is critical for successful cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, we show
that applying L2T during training can alleviate LLMs' reliance on the input
language and facilitate cross-linguistic knowledge integration without
translation-based learning. Code and datasets will be available.

Conclusion: MMAFFBen基准和配套模型的推出填补了多语言多模态情感分析领域的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Large language models and vision-language models (which we jointly call LMs)
have transformed NLP and CV, demonstrating remarkable potential across various
fields. However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment
analysis and emotion detection) remain underexplored. This gap is largely due
to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and the inherent
complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen,
the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective
analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35
languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity,
sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover,
we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis
tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate
various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic
comparison of their affective understanding capabilities. This project is

Motivation: 探讨实验创建内容与真实内容在情感表达上的差异，及其对模型训练和评估的影响。

Method: 收集并比较实验创建和真实的多模态社交媒体帖子，分析其情感标签、表达方式及模型表现。

Result: 实验创建的帖子更长，更依赖文本而非图像表达情感，且更关注典型情感事件；两类数据的人口统计特征不同。

Conclusion: 实验数据可有效训练泛化模型，但真实数据对评估模型实际效果必不可少。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires
data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by
asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the
real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study.
Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and
presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is
unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and
how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine
multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several
dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine
posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on
their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical
events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are
demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that
generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require
genuine data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SSPU的新方法，利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征指导大语言模型（LLM）的精确、可解释且鲁棒的遗忘学习，以解决现有方法在隐私和安全方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）存储大量信息，虽然强大，但在需要选择性知识遗忘时会引发隐私和安全问题。现有遗忘策略要么缺乏可解释性，要么无法有效防御对抗性提示。

Method: 提出SAE-Guided Subspace Projection Unlearning (SSPU)框架，通过SAE特征驱动模型参数空间的定向更新，包括数据驱动的层和特征选择、QR分解构建子空间，以及约束优化控制激活到“无关”子空间。

Result: 在WMDP-Cyber遗忘集和三个基准测试（MMLU、TruthfulQA、GSM8K）上，SSPU将有害知识准确率降低了3.22%，并提升了对抗性鲁棒性，降低了恶意提示下的准确率。

Conclusion: SSPU通过可解释的子空间引导优化，实现了鲁棒且可控的模型行为，揭示了现有遗忘方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them
powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge
removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from
gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE)
steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense
against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection
Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive
targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise,
interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs
data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR
decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an
"irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE
features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss
and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In
experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU,
TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared
to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering
malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings
expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how
interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable
model behavior.

Method: 通过实证评估，比较职业型人物角色（PBPs）和职业性格型人物角色（OPBPs）在多个科学领域的问答表现。

Result: 职业型人物角色能轻微提升问答准确性，而职业性格型人物角色即使与任务语义相关，也常导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 人物角色的相关性并不能保证有效利用知识，反而可能因认知限制阻碍知识应用。未来研究可探索人物角色表征如何更贴近人类社交概念化。

Abstract: Recent studies on personas have improved the way Large Language Models (LLMs)
interact with users. However, the effect of personas on domain-specific
question-answering (QA) tasks remains a subject of debate. This study analyzes
whether personas enhance specialized QA performance by introducing two types of
persona: Profession-Based Personas (PBPs) (e.g., scientist), which directly
relate to domain expertise, and Occupational Personality-Based Personas (OPBPs)
(e.g., scientific person), which reflect cognitive tendencies rather than
explicit expertise. Through empirical evaluations across multiple scientific
domains, we demonstrate that while PBPs can slightly improve accuracy, OPBPs
often degrade performance, even when semantically related to the task. Our
findings suggest that persona relevance alone does not guarantee effective
knowledge utilization and that they may impose cognitive constraints that
hinder optimal knowledge application. Future research can explore how nuanced
distinctions in persona representations guide LLMs, potentially contributing to
reasoning and knowledge retrieval that more closely mirror human social
conceptualization.

Motivation: 大型语言/多模态模型（LLMs/LMMs）虽然存储了大量预训练知识，但难以与现实世界的更新保持一致，导致在获取动态知识时容易出现灾难性遗忘。此前的研究主要集中在文本知识数据集构建和LLMs的知识注入上，缺乏对多模态动态知识注入的探索。

Method: 提出了EVOKE基准来评估LMMs在真实场景中注入多模态动态知识的能力，并通过实验分析了现有知识注入方法的局限性。

Result: 研究发现：（1）现有知识注入方法在动态知识上表现不佳；（2）监督微调会导致灾难性遗忘，尤其是指令跟随能力严重受损。同时发现文本知识增强在训练阶段能提升性能，而图像增强则无效；持续学习方法（如Replay和MoELoRA）能有效缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 当前的知识注入方法在动态知识上存在诸多限制，这激励了未来对更高效、稳定知识注入方法的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language/multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) store extensive pre-trained
knowledge but struggle to maintain consistency with real-world updates, making
it difficult to avoid catastrophic forgetting while acquiring evolving
knowledge. Previous work focused on constructing textual knowledge datasets and
exploring knowledge injection in LLMs, lacking exploration of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection in LMMs. To address this, we propose the EVOKE
benchmark to evaluate LMMs' ability to inject multimodal evolving knowledge in
real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection revealed two challenges: (1) Existing knowledge
injection methods perform terribly on evolving knowledge. (2) Supervised
fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, particularly instruction following
ability is severely compromised. Additionally, we provide pathways and find
that: (1) Text knowledge augmentation during the training phase improves
performance, while image augmentation cannot achieve it. (2) Continual learning
methods, especially Replay and MoELoRA, effectively mitigate forgetting. Our
findings indicate that current knowledge injection methods have many
limitations on evolving knowledge, which motivates further research on more
efficient and stable knowledge injection methods.

Abstract: Cultural content poses challenges for machine translation systems due to the
differences in conceptualizations between cultures, where language alone may
fail to convey sufficient context to capture region-specific meanings. In this
work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal
translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800
triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional
languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs)
in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations,
we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially
in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct
gender usage. By releasing CaMMT, we aim to support broader efforts in building
and evaluating multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with
cultural nuance and regional variation.

Abstract: Machine translation systems fail when processing code-mixed inputs for

expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a

filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic
appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our
naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance,
measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi
and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments,
augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately
49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation
methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish
a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models
generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a
code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to
use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented
reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits,
tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning
dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to
improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for
code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training
strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building
tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive
experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model
demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive
baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and
effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为TimeHC-RL的新方法，旨在通过时间感知分层认知强化学习提升大语言模型在社交智能领域的表现，实验证明其优于传统的System 2 RL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学和编程等需要深思熟虑的IQ相关领域取得了显著进展，但在社交智能领域的认知发展仍待探索。社交世界需要更丰富的认知模式（从直觉反应到深思熟虑），而现有方法主要依赖System 2认知。

Method: 论文提出了Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning (TimeHC-RL)方法，通过结合System 1和System 2认知模式，系统地探索了五种后训练范式和两种测试时干预范式。

Result: 实验结果表明，TimeHC-RL方法优于广泛采用的System 2 RL方法，使7B骨干模型的性能能够媲美DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI-O3等先进模型。

Conclusion: TimeHC-RL方法在提升大语言模型社交智能方面表现出色，同时通过系统探索揭示了多个有价值的见解。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
IQ-related domains that require careful thinking, such as mathematics and
coding. However, enhancing LLMs' cognitive development in social domains,
particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored.
Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a
richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and
surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics,
which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning),
we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning
(TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we
systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the
effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training
paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with
diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our
proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It
gives the 7B backbone model wings, enabling it to rival the performance of
advanced models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O3. Additionally, the systematic
exploration from post-training and test-time interventions perspectives to
improve LLMs' social intelligence has uncovered several valuable insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种对抗性攻击方法，通过优化语言模型使机器生成文本更接近人类写作风格，从而欺骗现有检测器，揭示其脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和大型语言模型的进步，合成内容的真实性提高，恶意使用（如虚假信息）的风险增加。现有机器生成文本检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力不足，亟需测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调语言模型，将机器生成文本的风格向人类写作靠拢，并分析检测器依赖的语言特征。

Result: 实验表明，现有检测器容易被少量对抗样本欺骗，检测性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法对未知领域文本的鲁棒性不足，需进一步改进检测技术以应对对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have
enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic content, raising concerns
about the potential for malicious use, such as misinformation and manipulation.
Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the
lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios.
In this work, we present a pipeline to test the resilience of state-of-the-art
MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed
adversarial attacks. To challenge the detectors, we fine-tune language models
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward
human-written text (HWT). This exploits the detectors' reliance on stylistic
clues, making new generations more challenging to detect. Additionally, we
analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and which features are
used by detectors to detect MGT texts. Our results show that detectors can be
easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in
detection performance. This highlights the importance of improving detection
methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合适配器集成和跨注意力微调方法，提升了低资源克里奥尔语的机器翻译性能，发现适配器的优势在于参数正则化而非语言信息传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用高资源相关语言的跨语言迁移技术，提升低资源克里奥尔语的机器翻译性能，探索适配器方法在语言迁移中的作用。

Method: 采用适配器集成（adapter souping）结合跨注意力微调（cross-attention fine-tuning）的方法，对预训练机器翻译模型进行调整，以利用语言迁移。

Result: 方法显著提升了基线性能，但发现语言相关性对适配器性能无显著影响；随机初始化的适配器同样有效，表明适配器的作用主要是参数正则化。

Conclusion: 研究表明，神经语言处理涉及多种成功因素，并非所有方法都以直观方式利用语言知识，适配器的优势可能在于正则化而非信息传递。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a
well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior
work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource
machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping
method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to
leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which
exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic
dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines.
However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does
not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our
cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly
initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting
lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer.
We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings
underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success
factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in
intuitive ways.

Abstract: LLMs often excel on standard benchmarks but falter on real-world tasks. We
introduce DeepQuestion, a scalable automated framework that augments existing
datasets based on Bloom's taxonomy and creates novel questions that trace
original solution paths to probe evaluative and creative skills. Extensive
experiments across ten open-source and proprietary models, covering both
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, reveal substantial performance drops (even
up to 70% accuracy loss) on higher-order tasks, underscoring persistent gaps in
deep reasoning. Our work highlights the need for cognitively diverse benchmarks
to advance LLM progress. DeepQuestion and related datasets will be released

TL;DR: 开发AI工具检测文化遗产数据中的冒犯性术语，并提供历史背景和现代视角，旨在促进更包容的收藏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产数据中常含有反映历史偏见的过时或冒犯性描述，机构面临大规模清理的挑战。

Method: 结合多语言词汇表（与边缘群体、研究者共创）、传统NLP技术和大型语言模型，开发网页应用并与主流平台集成。

Result: 工具已处理790万条记录，识别争议术语并为其添加上下文说明，而非直接删除。

Conclusion: 通过可视化偏见和提供可操作建议，该方法助力创建更具包容性的文化遗产数据集。

Abstract: Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the
history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding
of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or
offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs)
face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and
complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that
detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into
their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a
multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers,
and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language
Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH
platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the
contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms,
our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable
insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）中的人格特征主要在解码器的后三分之一层中表现出显著差异，不同伦理观有重叠激活区域，而政治意识形态则分布在更独立的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何在其表示空间中编码不同的人格特征、价值观和信仰，以增进对模型内部信息表示的理解，并为未来调整模型输出中特定人类特征提供参考。

Method: 使用降维和模式识别方法，识别模型层中人格特征编码差异最大的部分，并分析选定层中的激活模式，比较不同人格特征的共享和独特嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个预训练的仅解码器LLMs中，人格特征在解码器后三分之一层中表现出显著的表示空间差异；伦理观（如道德虚无主义和功利主义）的激活区域有重叠，而政治意识形态（如保守主义和自由主义）则分布在更独立的区域。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs内部表示人格特征的方式，有助于未来优化模型输出中特定人类特征的调制。

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of
human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation
space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and
pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the
greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the
activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are
encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding
spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the
analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within
the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for
specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism --
suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like
conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions.
These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally
represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation
of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes
potentially offensive sample statements.

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常依赖于紧密耦合的自注意力Transformer解码器，架构复杂且难以泛化。作者旨在设计一种更简单、高效且通用的推测解码方法。

Method: 提出了Budget EAGLE (Beagle)，一种基于跨注意力的Transformer解码器，无需池化或辅助组件。同时，提出了一种名为Two-Stage Block-Attention Training的新训练方法，以确保训练稳定性和收敛效率。

Result: 实验表明，Beagle在推理速度上与现有最佳方法（EAGLE-v2）相当，同时训练效率更高，内存使用更稳定。

Conclusion: Beagle为推测解码提供了一种更简单、高效的架构选择，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating
inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and
target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically
rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often
augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them
increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We
present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge,
cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on
par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need
for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving
training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time
simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose
Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training
stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle
achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than
EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative
decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩思维链时往往导致性能下降，而长思维轨迹又降低效率，需一种新方法解决此问题。

Method: 将推理过程建模为搜索树，结合A*算法和路径成本函数，提出双向重要性估计机制优化搜索效率。

Result: 在数学任务上，A*-Thought将QwQ-32B性能提升2.39倍（低预算），并减少50%输出长度（高预算）。

Conclusion: A*-Thought能高效压缩思维链，兼容多种模型，平衡性能与效率，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the
thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced
efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of
overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the
Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address
this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified
framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the
extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the
reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a
reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search
algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can
efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with
high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a
bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this
search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive
experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively
balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically,
A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with
low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with
high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs,
demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at:

Abstract: Understanding complex character relations is crucial for narrative analysis
and efficient script evaluation, yet existing extraction methods often fail to
handle long-form narratives with nuanced interactions. To address this
challenge, we present CREFT, a novel sequential framework leveraging
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. First, CREFT builds a base
character graph through knowledge distillation, then iteratively refines
character composition, relation extraction, role identification, and group
assignments. Experiments on a curated Korean drama dataset demonstrate that
CREFT significantly outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in both accuracy and
completeness. By systematically visualizing character networks, CREFT
streamlines narrative comprehension and accelerates script review -- offering
substantial benefits to the entertainment, publishing, and educational sectors.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation,
a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and
tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the
evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the
methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To
address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking
system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that
generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology
engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE
provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world
ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality
of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ
generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future
research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation
tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and
datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译系统仅覆盖全球5%的语言，扩展低资源语言覆盖需要数据高效的方法。

Method: 采用字符级编码器，结合SONAR多语言嵌入空间和教师-学生方法，利用ASR数据训练轻量适配器。

Result: 在75种语言的文本翻译中表现优于传统子词模型，语音翻译在33种语言上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 字符级方法在低资源语言和跨模态任务中展现出优越的迁移能力和零样本泛化性。

Abstract: Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5%
of the world's languages. Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of
low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on
cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a
character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and
modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding
space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a
teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a
character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter
to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level
encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages.
Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+
demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language
transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them
in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability
to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from
the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text
translation on the FLEURS benchmark on 33 languages, surpassing previous
supervised and cascade models, albeit being a zero-shot model with minimal
supervision from ASR data.

Abstract: Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV
scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and
thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We
introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization
that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential

innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific
preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text
into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM
Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk
processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries. Our
method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving
up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV
scripts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent LLMs in
handling long-form content, offering a scalable approach for structured
summarization in diverse storytelling domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语在语义文本相似度任务中因缺乏高质量数据集和预训练模型而研究受限，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 采用Matryoshka表示学习和混合损失训练方法，结合阿拉伯语三元组数据集进行自然语言推理任务优化。

Result: GATE模型在STS基准测试中性能提升20-25%，优于包括OpenAI在内的更大模型。

Conclusion: GATE模型有效捕捉阿拉伯语独特的语义细微差别，为阿拉伯语NLP任务提供了先进解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a critical task in natural language
processing (NLP), enabling applications in retrieval, clustering, and
understanding semantic relationships between texts. However, research in this
area for the Arabic language remains limited due to the lack of high-quality
datasets and pre-trained models. This scarcity of resources has restricted the
accurate evaluation and advance of semantic similarity in Arabic text. This
paper introduces General Arabic Text Embedding (GATE) models that achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the Semantic Textual Similarity task within the
MTEB benchmark. GATE leverages Matryoshka Representation Learning and a hybrid
loss training approach with Arabic triplet datasets for Natural Language
Inference, which are essential for enhancing model performance in tasks that
demand fine-grained semantic understanding. GATE outperforms larger models,
including OpenAI, with a 20-25% performance improvement on STS benchmarks,
effectively capturing the unique semantic nuances of Arabic.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种跨层归因算法，用于分析稀疏MoE架构的效率与协作模式，揭示了专家分工与任务敏感性的关系，并提出了平衡效率、专业化和鲁棒性的设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对密集模型的归因方法无法有效捕捉稀疏MoE架构中的动态路由-专家交互，因此需要新的方法来增强MoE模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种跨层归因算法，对比分析了稀疏MoE架构（如Qwen 1.5-MoE、OLMoE、Mixtral-8x7B）与密集模型（如Qwen 1.5-7B、Llama-7B、Mixtral-7B）。

Result: MoE模型通过“中期激活、后期放大”模式实现每层效率提升37%；专家分工呈现“基础-精炼”框架；语义驱动路由表现出注意力头与专家的强相关性（r=0.68）；模型深度影响鲁棒性，任务敏感性指导设计。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE可解释性提供了新见解，提出了平衡效率、专业化和鲁棒性的设计原则，对MoE架构的优化具有指导意义。

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those
with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods
for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse
MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution
algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE,
Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results
show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation,
late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers
refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement"
framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while
routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic
attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations
between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.
Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates
expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10
experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe
degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive
tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant
tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights
advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency,
specialization, and robustness.

Motivation: 当前文本抑郁检测模型缺乏预测可解释性，影响系统可信度，需改进模型解释能力。

Method: 采用掩蔽硬实例挖掘（MHIM）策略，选择性掩蔽模型注意力权重，迫使模型分散关注更多显著特征。

Result: 在Thai-Maywe和DAIC-WOZ数据集上，MHIM显著提升了预测准确率和可解释性指标。

Conclusion: MHIM能有效平衡抑郁检测任务的性能与可解释性，为跨语言应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for improved explainability in
text-based depression detection. While offering predictive outcomes, current
solutions often overlook the understanding of model predictions which can
hinder trust in the system. We propose the use of Masked Hard Instance Mining
(MHIM) to enhance the explainability in the depression detection task. MHIM
strategically masks attention weights within the model, compelling it to
distribute attention across a wider range of salient features. We evaluate MHIM
on two datasets representing distinct languages: Thai (Thai-Maywe) and English
(DAIC-WOZ). Our results demonstrate that MHIM significantly improves
performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and explainability metrics.

*Daniela Occhipinti,Marco Guerini,Malvina Nissim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了对话代理如何通过结合自身和对话者的人物信息来提升生成内容的一致性和多样性，并评估了模型在不同情境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注对话与给定人物信息的对齐，而忽视了适应对话者特征的重要性。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索模型在结合双方人物信息、处理熟悉与陌生话题及对话者时的表现。

Method: 通过设计多样化的对话者配对和话题，采用作者识别任务框架，结合LLM和人工评估，系统性地分析对话者信息对生成内容的影响。

Result: 结果显示，获取对话者信息有助于识别目标说话者，而屏蔽信息则效果相反。模型在陌生对话者面前表现不佳，但在话题泛化上表现良好。零样本设置下，LLM倾向于复制传记细节，简化任务但降低了挑战性。

Conclusion: 结合对话双方的人物信息能显著提升对话代理的表现，但在处理陌生对话者时仍需改进。未来的研究应进一步优化模型在这一领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly
improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus
has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to
the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with
both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when
dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the
impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We
evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing
the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both
LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing
information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue
generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the
recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although
models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar
interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy
biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

Abstract: In an era of exponential scientific growth, identifying novel research ideas
is crucial and challenging in academia. Despite potential, the lack of an
appropriate benchmark dataset hinders the research of novelty detection. More
importantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and
then cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between
textual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness
large language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated
with two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the
considerate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based
on their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To
capture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by
distilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar
conception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty
detection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the
proposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks. Codes and data are

Motivation: 传统的大语言模型评估方法依赖资源密集的人工对比，缺乏透明度和标准化。POLLUX旨在提供一种可扩展、可解释的评估工具。

Method: POLLUX通过定义详细评估标准和评分协议，使用模型自评和理由说明，覆盖35种任务类型，包含2100个专业编写的提示。

Result: POLLUX发布了7B和32B的LLM-as-a-Judge评估模型，提供细粒度的生成输出评估，有效替代人工判断。

Conclusion: POLLUX为俄语大语言模型开发提供了可扩展、透明的评估工具，显著降低了评估成本并提高了精度。

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to
evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances
the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of
detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate
responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables
transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming,
side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained
taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code
generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100
manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized
by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset
entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B)
evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach
provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model
development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了基于左心室射血分数（LVEF）的心力衰竭（HF）患者表型分类模型，发现出院小结是最具信息量的数据源，Aug-Linear模型在性能与可解释性上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心力衰竭患者具有多样化的表型，影响治疗和预后。研究旨在评估利用结构化和非结构化数据进行LVEF分类的模型性能及可解释性。

Method: 研究分析了2015-2023年阿姆斯特丹UMC两家医院的33,105例HF住院数据，使用AMC数据训练模型，VUmc数据外部验证。结合诊断代码、超声心动图结果和文本生成银标准标签，并手动标注300例金标准标签。比较了Transformer类黑盒模型与Aug-Linear白盒模型。

Result: 仅使用出院小结的BERT和Aug-Linear模型表现最佳（外部验证AUC分别为0.84和0.81）。Aug-Linear的解释与临床医生标注的一致性优于黑盒模型的事后解释方法。

Conclusion: 出院小结是HF表型分类的最佳数据源。Aug-Linear模型在保持高性能的同时提供临床可理解的解释，适用于透明化临床决策。

Abstract: Objective: Heart failure (HF) patients present with diverse phenotypes
affecting treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates models for phenotyping
HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using
structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.
  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both
Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105
hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training,
and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included
tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF
classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results,
and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for
testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box)
models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured
data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge
letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF
classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from
black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone,
achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for
Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear
explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc
explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for
phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while
providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in
transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across
diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis a critical area for data security and
encryption has not yet been thoroughly explored in LLM evaluations. To address
this gap, we evaluate cryptanalytic potential of state of the art LLMs on
encrypted texts generated using a range of cryptographic algorithms. We
introduce a novel benchmark dataset comprising diverse plain texts spanning
various domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics paired with their
encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few shot settings, we assess multiple
LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different
encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in side-channel communication while raising concerns about
their susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks. This research highlights the
dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing
discussion on AI safety and security.

Conclusion: FSPO通过事实验证机制，成功解决了强化学习微调导致的幻觉问题，提升了语言模型的推理能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks
through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive
capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical
analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning
significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically
analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient,
entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key
factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose
Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL
fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each
reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to
dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual
correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical
reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models
demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing
reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Motivation: 现有研究普遍认为主要基于英语数据训练的LLMs在各语言上表现一致，但缺乏对文化和语言背景的综合考量。

Method: 通过分解语言媒介和文化背景维度，构建双评估框架，进行广泛模型评估，并采用可解释性探针分析神经元激活模式。

Result: 发现'文化语言协同'现象——当问题与语言文化背景一致时模型表现更优，特定神经元激活比例可作多语言性能训练指标。

Conclusion: 挑战了LLMs跨语言表现一致的固有认知，强调需结合文化和语言背景进行模型评估。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Dual Evaluation Framework to comprehensively assess
the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. By decomposing the evaluation along the
dimensions of linguistic medium and cultural context, this framework enables a
nuanced analysis of LLMs' ability to process questions within both native and
cross-cultural contexts cross-lingually. Extensive evaluations are conducted on
a wide range of models, revealing a notable "CulturalLinguistic Synergy"
phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are
culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored
through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of
specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This
activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating
multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the
prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform
uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and
linguistically model evaluations. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 当前基于大型语言模型（LLM）的技能提取方法计算成本高且速度慢，无法满足实时劳动力市场分析的需求。

Method: 采用对比学习与词级注意力机制结合的轻量级双编码器模型ConTeXT-match，并构建了Skill-XL基准数据集和JobBERT V2模型。

Result: ConTeXT-match在技能分类任务中实现了高效且高性能的提取，JobBERT V2生成了高质量的职位表示。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型高效、准确且可扩展，适用于大规模实时劳动力市场分析。

Abstract: Labor market analysis relies on extracting insights from job advertisements,
which provide valuable yet unstructured information on job titles and
corresponding skill requirements. While state-of-the-art methods for skill
extraction achieve strong performance, they depend on large language models
(LLMs), which are computationally expensive and slow. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{ConTeXT-match}, a novel contrastive learning approach with token-level
attention that is well-suited for the extreme multi-label classification task
of skill classification. \textbf{ConTeXT-match} significantly improves skill
extraction efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with
a lightweight bi-encoder model. To support robust evaluation, we introduce
\textbf{Skill-XL}, a new benchmark with exhaustive, sentence-level skill
annotations that explicitly address the redundancy in the large label space.
Finally, we present \textbf{JobBERT V2}, an improved job title normalization
model that leverages extracted skills to produce high-quality job title
representations. Experiments demonstrate that our models are efficient,
accurate, and scalable, making them ideal for large-scale, real-time labor
market analysis.

Motivation: 传统排序算法效率评估基于两两比较次数，但在使用大型语言模型(LLM)进行成对排名提示(PRP)时，昂贵的LLM推理成本颠覆了这一模式，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 提出以LLM推理为核心的成本模型框架，推荐采用批处理和缓存等策略来降低推理成本，重新评估算法效率。

Result: 研究发现传统最优算法在LLM推理主导成本时可能效率低下，某些优化条件下会出现性能反转。

Conclusion: LLM推理成本改变了排序算法的效率评估标准，需要采用新框架和优化策略来适应这一变化。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for analyzing sorting algorithms in pairwise
ranking prompting (PRP), re-centering the cost model around LLM inferences
rather than traditional pairwise comparisons. While classical metrics based on
comparison counts have traditionally been used to gauge efficiency, our
analysis reveals that expensive LLM inferences overturn these predictions;
accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching
to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical
setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain
optimizations.

TL;DR: PRISM框架首次实现可解释的政治偏见嵌入，通过两阶段方法提升语义文本嵌入在政治偏见分类中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型虽能捕捉通用语义，但常忽略意识形态差异，限制了在需要理解政治偏见任务中的效果。

Method: PRISM分为两阶段：(1)从弱标注新闻数据中提取细粒度政治话题及偏见指标；(2)基于指标对齐为新闻文章分配结构化偏见分数。

Result: 在两个大规模数据集上的实验表明，PRISM在政治偏见分类上优于现有文本嵌入模型，并提供高度可解释的表征。

Conclusion: PRISM通过显式关联偏见揭示维度，增强了嵌入的可解释性和预测能力，适用于多样化检索和意识形态分析。

Abstract: Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual
content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space
reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at
capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting
their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias.
To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to
Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key
stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically
extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators
from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding,
which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment
with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly
tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and
predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we
demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in
political bias classification while offering highly interpretable
representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

Conclusion: 结论表明，结合自监督和自训练的级联方法在提升ASR模型性能方面是必要的，MSDA框架在低资源语言和弱监督场景下表现卓越。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation
framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage
Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation
approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised
techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of
ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is
particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly
supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised
domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a
cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一LLM单轮预测，但需要适应多元文化场景以服务全球用户。

Method: 提出两种多智能体辩论变体：纯辩论模式和动态选择自省/辩论模式，在75国社交礼仪数据集上测试21种LLM组合。

Result: 辩论方法显著提升准确率与文化群体公平性，7-9B小模型可达到27B大模型水平。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论能有效增强LLM的文化适应能力，且计算成本更低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse
cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While
previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose
to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural
adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based
agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final
decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively
debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and
debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs
(and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette
norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall
accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably,
multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies
comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）容易生成有害内容或被恶意利用，而现有的安全对齐数据集在风险覆盖上不够全面，主要关注词汇多样性而忽略了其他关键维度。

Method: 提出TRIDENT框架，通过基于角色的零样本LLM生成，覆盖词汇多样性、恶意意图和越狱策略三个维度，生成多样化的有害指令并配以伦理对齐响应，构建了两个数据集TRIDENT-Core和TRIDENT-Edge。

Result: 在Llama 3.1-8B模型上微调TRIDENT-Edge数据集后，Harm Score平均降低14.29%，Attack Success Rate降低20%，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TRIDENT框架有效提升了模型的安全性，通过系统性风险覆盖和多样化数据生成，为LLM的安全对齐提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to generating harmful content or being exploited
for malicious purposes. Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced
to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets
often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily
on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically
measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential
dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We
further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based,
zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions
spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically
aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311
examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1-8B on
TRIDENT-Edge demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving an average 14.29%
reduction in Harm Score, and a 20% decrease in Attack Success Rate compared to
the best-performing baseline model fine-tuned on the WildBreak dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法在压缩大语言模型时会导致显著的性能下降，主要原因是剪枝接口处激活值在层和token间不匹配。

Method: 采用Hadamard变换抑制特定token的异常值，并通过通道缩放对齐激活值幅度，最终融合为单一矩阵作为补丁。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B模型上剪枝5层后，LinearPatch保留原始模型94.15%的性能，优于现有方法4%。经知识蒸馏优化后可进一步提升至95.16%。

Conclusion: LinearPatch是一种高效插件式解决方案，能以可忽略的推理开销显著改善剪枝后模型性能。

Abstract: Layer pruning has become a popular technique for compressing large language
models (LLMs) due to its simplicity. However, existing layer pruning methods
often suffer from significant performance drops. We identify that this
degradation stems from the mismatch of activation magnitudes across layers and
tokens at the pruning interface. To address this, we propose LinearPatch, a
simple plug-and-play technique to revive the layer-pruned LLMs. The proposed
method adopts Hadamard transformation to suppress massive outliers in
particular tokens, and channel-wise scaling to align the activation magnitudes.
These operations can be fused into a single matrix, which functions as a patch
to bridge the pruning interface with negligible inference overhead. LinearPatch
retains up to 94.15% performance of the original model when pruning 5 layers of
LLaMA-3-8B on the question answering benchmark, surpassing existing
state-of-the-art methods by 4%. In addition, the patch matrix can be further
optimized with memory efficient offline knowledge distillation. With only 5K
samples, the retained performance of LinearPatch can be further boosted to
95.16% within 30 minutes on a single computing card.

### [141] [Should I Share this Translation? Evaluating Quality Feedback for User Reliance on Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24683)
*Dayeon Ki,Kevin Duh,Marine Carpuat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种AI翻译质量反馈机制，发现隐式反馈（尤其是QA表格）在提升决策准确性和用户信任方面效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的广泛应用，缺乏评估AI输出质量的用户需要有效的反馈机制来负责任地使用AI，尤其是在机器翻译场景中。

Method: 研究比较了四种质量反馈类型：显式反馈（错误高亮和LLM解释）和隐式反馈（回译和QA表格），在机器翻译场景中测试用户决策。

Result: 除错误高亮外，所有反馈类型均显著提升决策准确性和适当依赖度；隐式反馈（特别是QA表格）在准确性、用户信任和减轻心理负担方面表现最优。

Conclusion: 隐式反馈机制（如QA表格）是帮助用户理解AI翻译质量并做出更好决策的有效工具。

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback
mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly
in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI
predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where
monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then
with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit
feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using 1)
error highlights and 2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps
users compare MT inputs and outputs through 3) backtranslation and 4)
question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error
highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate
reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields
significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision
accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest
ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

*Qinglin Zhu,Runcong Zhao,Hanqi Yan,Yulan He,Yudong Chen,Lin Gui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Soft Reasoning框架，通过嵌入扰动和贝叶斯优化改进大语言模型的复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在多样性不足和搜索效率低下的问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 结合嵌入扰动和贝叶斯优化，通过验证器引导的目标优化首词嵌入，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了推理准确性和连贯性，且计算开销小，具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: Soft Reasoning是一种高效、模型无关的解决方案，能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limited
diversity and inefficient search. We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based
search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide
generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration
and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided
objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves
reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search.
Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making
it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

*Sander Land,Catherine Arnett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SCRIPT-BPE编码方案，通过基于Unicode脚本和类别的初始令牌绕过UTF-8字节转换，解决多语言环境下BPE分词器的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前BPE分词器在多语言环境中存在对非西方文字的惩罚和部分UTF-8序列令牌的问题，且预分词常依赖复杂的正则表达式，导致脆弱性和意外边缘情况。

Method: 采用SCRIPT编码方案，基于Unicode脚本和类别属性进行初始令牌化，并提出一种强制字符完整性的约束BPE合并策略。

Result: SCRIPT-BPE在保持竞争力的压缩率的同时，消除了非拉丁文字语言的编码惩罚。

Conclusion: SCRIPT-BPE为多语言环境下的分词提供了一种简单、鲁棒的替代方案，优于基于正则表达式的预分词策略。

Abstract: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers, widely used in Large Language Models,
face challenges in multilingual settings, including penalization of non-Western
scripts and the creation of tokens with partial UTF-8 sequences.
Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also
introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script
Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that
bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script
and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based
pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust
alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also
introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces
character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our
experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while
eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合音素表征和思维链框架的语音到文本翻译方法，旨在提升低资源和零资源语言场景下的翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决低资源和零资源语言在语音到文本翻译中的挑战，作者希望通过引入音素识别作为中间步骤，增强跨语言迁移能力。

Method: 该方法基于多语言大语言模型（LLM），扩展其处理语音和音素的能力，并采用课程学习策略逐步引入更复杂的任务。

Result: 实验表明，音素增强的思维链框架在低资源条件下提升了翻译质量，并实现了零资源翻译，但对高资源性能略有影响。

Conclusion: 尽管存在权衡，但基于音素的思维链框架为语音到文本翻译在多样化语言中的普及提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates
phoneme representations into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve
translation in low-resource and zero-resource settings. By introducing phoneme
recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer,
enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system
builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes.
Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces
more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that
phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions
and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource
performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that
phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across
diverse languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出利用大语言模型生成合成ABSA数据的方法，解决了真实标注数据稀缺问题，并评估了三种先进模型在生成数据上的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ABSA研究面临标注数据稀缺且难以覆盖真实对话多样性的问题，制约了模型训练与评估。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成跨领域、保持主题与情感分布一致性的合成数据，并用Gemini 1.5 Pro等三种LLM评估数据质量。

Result: 合成数据有效：DeepSeek-R1精度最高，Gemini 1.5 Pro推理最快，Claude 3.5 Sonnet召回率突出。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的合成数据生成是创建ABSA资源的可行方案，能减少对稀缺真实标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers granular insights into opinions
but often suffers from the scarcity of diverse, labeled datasets that reflect
real-world conversational nuances. This paper presents an approach for
generating synthetic ABSA data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
this gap. We detail the generation process aimed at producing data with
consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains using
GPT-4o. The quality and utility of the generated data were evaluated by
assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification
tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic data,
revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeekR1 showed
higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall,
and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference. We conclude that
LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for
creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation
without reliance on limited or inaccessible real-world labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型偏见评估资源通常缺乏受偏见影响的社区的参与，也很少采用参与式方法。本文旨在通过教育社区的参与，创建一个更全面、反映本地语境的数据集。

Method: 通过一个专业发展课程，370名高中教师和5,370名学生从189所拉丁美洲学校参与创建了HESEIA数据集。教师使用最小对方法，创建反映其学科和社区中相关刻板印象的句子。

Result: HESEIA数据集在人口统计轴线和知识领域方面表现出多样性，并包含比现有数据集更多未被当前大型语言模型识别的刻板印象。

Conclusion: HESEIA数据集为基于教育社区的偏见评估提供了支持，其参与式方法和本地语境反映使其在评估大型语言模型偏见方面更具优势。

Abstract: Most resources for evaluating social biases in Large Language Models are
developed without co-design from the communities affected by these biases, and
rarely involve participatory approaches. We introduce HESEIA, a dataset of
46,499 sentences created in a professional development course. The course
involved 370 high-school teachers and 5,370 students from 189 Latin-American
schools. Unlike existing benchmarks, HESEIA captures intersectional biases
across multiple demographic axes and school subjects. It reflects local
contexts through the lived experience and pedagogical expertise of educators.
Teachers used minimal pairs to create sentences that express stereotypes
relevant to their school subjects and communities. We show the dataset
diversity in term of demographic axes represented and also in terms of the
knowledge areas included. We demonstrate that the dataset contains more
stereotypes unrecognized by current LLMs than previous datasets. HESEIA is
available to support bias assessments grounded in educational communities.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了方言识别的鲁棒性，相关模型和数据集将促进阿拉伯语包容性语音技术的发展。

Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale
data collection pipelines that enable the development of inclusive speech
technologies for Arabic language varieties. However, the reliability of current
ADI systems is limited by poor generalization to out-of-domain speech. In this
paper, we present an effective approach based on voice conversion for training
ADI models that achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly
improves robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Evaluated on a newly collected
real-world test set spanning four different domains, our approach yields
consistent improvements of up to +34.1% in accuracy across domains.
Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice
conversion helps mitigate the speaker bias in the ADI dataset. We release our
robust ADI model and cross-domain evaluation dataset to support the development
of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic.

Motivation: 金融领域缺乏有效的多模态评估数据集，阻碍了多模态大语言模型在该领域的发展。

Method: 通过20名标注者和精心设计的验证机制确保数据质量，并开发了包含幻觉惩罚和多维能力评估的FinScore系统。

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4o等先进模型在FinMME上表现不佳，数据集具有高鲁棒性，预测变异低于1%。

Conclusion: FinMME为金融领域多模态大语言模型的评估提供了可靠基准，展示了其挑战性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development
in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of
effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the
development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing
more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial
domains and 6 asset classes, featuring 10 major chart types and 21 subtypes. We
ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation
mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system
incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability
assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit
unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The
benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different
prompts remaining below 1%, demonstrating superior reliability compared to
existing datasets. Our dataset and evaluation protocol are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决大语言模型在缺乏合成数据和详细反馈时性能提升受限的问题，探索通过自我反思机制实现模型自我优化的可行性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 任务失败时生成自我反思分析；2) 结合反思内容重试任务，成功则对反思阶段生成的token给予奖励。

Result: 实验显示该方法使模型性能显著提升（数学公式书写最高提升34.7%，函数调用提升18.1%），且较小微调模型可超越参数量大10倍的同类模型。

Conclusion: 该范式为语言模型在有限反馈条件下实现自我优化提供了有效途径，能显著提升模型在挑战性任务中的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models
through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model
to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate
that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even
when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is
available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given
task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous
attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the
self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens
generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental
results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model
architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%
improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5
billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are
10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful
and reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with
limited external feedback.

Motivation: 现有评估方法难以应对快速发展的语言模型，且构建更具挑战性的数据集成本高昂。

Result: 电路稳定性能够刻画和预测模型的不同泛化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为模型通用性与可解释性的关联提供了严谨的研究方向。

Abstract: Extensively evaluating the capabilities of (large) language models is
difficult. Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark
saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive.
Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we
introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit
stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning
process-its circuit-across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit
stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we
empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize
and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a
step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令跟随文本嵌入方法需为每个新指令重新编码整个语料库，计算开销大。

Method: 基于预计算嵌入的轻量级空间变换机制，利用少量标注数据实时调整嵌入以对齐用户指令。

Result: 在9个真实数据集上实现SOTA效果，实时处理速度提升6~300倍。

Conclusion: GSTransform高效解决了指令动态适配问题，为文本嵌入提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following
text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user
instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent
advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational
overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new
instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel
instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space
Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is
inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of
repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a
lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in
real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text
data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive
experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine
real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves
instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods
while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on
large-scale datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长，系统性文献综述（SLR）需要高效筛选相关论文。现有方法在二元分类和问答排序中存在局限性，且缺乏完整的纳入与排除标准基准。

Method: 论文手动提取了57篇SLR的纳入与排除标准及研究问题，并提出LGAR方法，结合LLM分级评分器和密集重排序器进行零样本摘要排序。

Result: 实验表明，LGAR在平均精度上比现有问答方法提升5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: LGAR为SLR摘要筛选提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of
the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and
evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate
papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date,
abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary
classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking
approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to
evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks
do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as
research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling
principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a
zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance
scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR
outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision.
Our code and data is publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了数据集多样性对大型语言模型监督微调(SFT)的影响，提出宏观、介观和微观三个层次的多样性控制策略，并发现响应中的微观多样性策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据集多样性对机器学习模型训练至关重要，但现有研究对其系统性分析仍不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究不同层次的多样性控制策略对SFT阶段模型性能的影响。

Method: 构建包含11.7万开源SFT样本的固定大小数据集，应用宏观(整体语义)、介观(指令单元)和微观(响应标记统计分布)三个层次的六种多样性控制策略，并微调LLMs进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，宏观和介观策略随多样性增加性能提升，而响应中的微观策略不仅表现出更强的性能-多样性相关性，且在最大多样性时性能优于所有其他策略。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建高性能SFT数据集提供了具体指导，特别强调了响应微观多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Dataset diversity plays a pivotal role for the successful training of many
machine learning models, particularly in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage
of large language model (LLM) development. Despite increasing recognition of
its importance, systematic analyses of dataset diversity still remain
underexplored. To address this gap, this work presents a systematic taxonomy of
existing diversity-control strategies, which primarily focus on the instruction
component, operating at either macroscopic (entire instruction semantics) or
mesoscopic levels (instruction units), and furthermore introduces a novel
analysis of microscopic diversity within the response component, specifically
analyzing the statistical distribution of tokens in SFT training samples. In
the experimental evaluation, we construct fixed-size datasets (e.g., 10,000
samples each) from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples, incorporating
six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and
microscopic levels applied to both instructions and responses. We then
fine-tune LLMs on these datasets to assess the six diversity-control
strategies. Results reveal that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies
lead to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy
in responses exhibits both a stronger correlation between model performance and
the degree of diversity and superior performance with maximum diversity across
all strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for constructing
high-performance SFT datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大语言模型使用认知标记表达自信度的可靠性，发现标记在分布内表现稳定，但在分布外不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的应用增多，准确评估其自信度变得至关重要。人类通常通过认知标记（如“相当自信”）而非数值来表达自信，但模型是否一致使用这些标记反映其内在自信尚不明确。

Method: 研究首先将标记自信度定义为模型使用认知标记时的观察准确率，并在开源和专有大语言模型上，通过分布内和分布外的问答数据集评估其稳定性。

Result: 结果显示，认知标记在分布内泛化良好，但在分布外场景中自信度不一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现对认知标记用于自信度评估的可靠性提出重要质疑，强调需要改进基于标记的自信度与实际模型不确定性之间的对齐。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express
confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of
numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use
these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of
quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap,
we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs
an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple
question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while
markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is
inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant
concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,
underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence
and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at

### [155] [Drop Dropout on Single-Epoch Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24788)
*Houjun Liu,John Bauer,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在单周期预训练的大型语言模型中，不使用dropout反而能提升下游任务性能，并增强模型的可编辑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管dropout在深度学习中作为正则化技术广泛应用，但在现代大型语言模型（LLM）的单周期预训练中，过拟合现象较少，导致dropout未被采用。然而，dropout在语言模型预训练中的作用尚未得到充分实证研究。

Method: 通过在单周期预训练中对比使用不同dropout率的掩码语言模型（BERT）和自回归语言模型（Pythia 160M和1.4B），评估其在语言建模、形态句法（BLiMP）、问答（SQuAD）和自然语言推理（MNLI）等下游任务的表现，并进一步分析模型的可编辑性。

Result: 实验表明，预训练时不使用dropout能提升下游任务性能；早期dropout同样会降低模型表现。此外，无dropout训练的模型在基于梯度的模型编辑（MEND）中表现更好，在基于表示的编辑（ReFT）中表现相当。

Conclusion: 建议在单周期预训练中放弃使用dropout，以优化模型性能和可编辑性。

Abstract: Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that
reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep
learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to
modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for
large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on
the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch
pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs
with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language
modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and
natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during
pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout"
also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further
investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without
dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and
equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate
to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自动故事生成方面表现出巨大潜力，但在保持长篇连贯性和提供用户直观有效控制方面仍存在挑战。检索增强生成（RAG）虽能减少幻觉，但结构化数据在生成式叙事中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文提出了一种知识图谱辅助的故事生成流程，并通过15名参与者的用户研究进行评估。参与者创建故事提示、生成故事，并通过编辑知识图谱来调整叙事。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，知识图谱显著提升了动作导向和结构化叙事的故事质量。编辑知识图谱还增强了用户的控制感，使故事生成更具互动性和趣味性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱能有效提升LLM生成故事的质量和用户控制体验，为交互式叙事提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story
generation, but challenges remain in maintaining long-form coherence and
providing users with intuitive and effective control. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text
generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative
storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge
graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality
and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling
pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15
participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories,
and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs
significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured
narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge
graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging,
interactive, and playful.

*Li yunhan,Wu gengshen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估法律文本质量的框架，分析了49个大型语言模型，发现模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定，推理模型优于基础架构，并推荐Qwen3系列为性价比最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法律领域的大型语言模型评估主要关注事实准确性，而忽略了清晰度、连贯性和术语等语言质量方面。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 首先开发了一个回归模型来评估法律文本的质量，然后创建了一套专门的法律问题集，最后用这个框架分析了49个大型语言模型。

Result: 研究发现：1) 模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定；2) 量化和上下文长度等工程选择影响微乎其微；3) 推理模型表现优于基础架构。Qwen3系列被推荐为性价比最优选择。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅建立了法律大型语言模型的标准化评估协议，还揭示了当前训练数据精炼方法的基本局限性。代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications,
current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while
largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity,
coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First,
we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on
clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of
legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off
at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at
72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and
context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical
significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently
outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the
release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series
as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only
establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers
fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的原子事实检查框架，用于提高医学长问答中大型语言模型的可靠性和可解释性，通过分解和验证原子事实显著减少了幻觉和错误引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域展现出广泛知识，但存在幻觉和不准确引用问题，影响其临床应用和监管合规。现有方法如检索增强生成虽部分解决这些问题，但幻觉和低事实可解释性仍存。

Method: 引入原子事实检查框架，将模型生成的回答分解为可验证的原子事实单元，每个单元独立对照医学指南权威知识库进行验证，实现错误针对性修正和文献溯源。

Result: 经医学专家多读者评估和自动化开放问答基准测试，框架显著提升事实准确性和可解释性，整体回答改进达40%，幻觉检测率为50%。

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向更可信赖和可靠临床LLM应用的关键一步，解决了医学AI应用中的主要缺陷，增强了AI辅助医疗的信心。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are
prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to
their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as
Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding
answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level
explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking
framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used
in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated
responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is
independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical
guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct
tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and
explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader
assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated
significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework
achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination
detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant
chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the
generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.
This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable
clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical
application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，用于量化模型对数据的记忆能力，并区分了无意记忆与泛化，发现GPT类模型的容量约为每参数3.6比特。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决先前语言模型研究中难以区分记忆与泛化的问题，旨在更准确地衡量模型的记忆能力及其与泛化的关系。

Method: 方法包括将记忆分为无意记忆和泛化两部分，通过消除泛化来测量总记忆量，并训练不同规模的Transformer模型进行验证。

Result: 结果显示，GPT类模型的容量约为每参数3.6比特，当模型容量填满后，无意记忆减少，泛化开始占主导。

Conclusion: 结论指出，模型在数据量增加时会先记忆后泛化，这一发现为理解模型容量与数据规模的关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a
datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior
studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle
memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two
components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains
about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model
contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate
generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an
estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language
models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until
their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended
memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of
transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and
produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to
membership inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战多语言训练对跨语言迁移任务（如多义词消歧和词汇语义变化）的固有优势假设。

Method: 通过对28种语言的大规模分析，研究多语言训练对跨语言迁移的影响。

Result: 发现多语言训练的优势主要来自数据构成和评估方法等混杂因素，而非多语言性本身。

Conclusion: 呼吁在多语言NLP中进行更严格的评估，研究结果对低资源和类型多样的语言有广泛意义。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer allows models to perform tasks in languages unseen
during training and is often assumed to benefit from increased multilinguality.
In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored,
sense-aware tasks: polysemy disambiguation and lexical semantic change. Through
a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training
is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead,
we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and
evaluation artifacts - better account for the perceived advantages of
multilinguality. Our findings call for more rigorous evaluations in
multilingual NLP. We release fine-tuned models and benchmarks to support
further research, with implications extending to low-resource and typologically
diverse languages.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了LLM的忠实置信度校准问题，发现现有方法不足，并提出新方法MetaFaith显著提升校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在传达错误信息时经常使用肯定性语言，导致用户过度依赖和信任度下降，因此需要研究其不确定性表达的可靠性。

Method: 提出MetaFaith方法，这是一种受人类元认知启发的基于提示的校准方法，在多种模型和任务领域进行测试。

Result: 研究表明LLM在此任务上普遍失败，现有干预措施不足；而MetaFaith可将忠实性提升61%，在人类评估中83%优于原始生成。

Conclusion: MetaFaith能有效改善LLM的忠实置信度校准，为解决LLM不确定性表达不可靠的问题提供了新方案。

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty
communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false
claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first
systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,
benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that
$\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a
comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing
interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only
marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even
harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human
metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration
across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in
faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged
by humans.

TL;DR: AlphaOne（α1）是一个通用框架，通过在测试时动态调节大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理进度，结合慢思考和快思考机制，提升推理能力和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在推理过程中缺乏灵活性和效率，尤其是在需要动态调整推理进度的情况下。AlphaOne旨在通过引入α时刻和动态调度机制，统一并泛化现有的单调缩放方法，实现更高效的推理。

Method: AlphaOne引入α时刻作为缩放思考阶段，通过伯努利随机过程动态调度慢思考转换，并在α时刻后确定性地终止慢思考，以促进快速推理和高效答案生成。

Result: 在数学、编码和科学领域的多个挑战性基准测试中，Alpha1表现出卓越的推理能力和效率。

Conclusion: Alpha1通过灵活的慢到快推理调制，显著提升了大型推理模型的性能和效率，为复杂推理任务提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents AlphaOne ($\alpha$1), a universal framework for
modulating reasoning progress in large reasoning models (LRMs) at test time.
$\alpha$1 first introduces $\alpha$ moment, which represents the scaled
thinking phase with a universal parameter $\alpha$. Within this scaled
pre-$\alpha$ moment phase, it dynamically schedules slow thinking transitions
by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli
stochastic process. After the $\alpha$ moment, $\alpha$1 deterministically
terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast
reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and
generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense
slow-to-fast reasoning modulation. Extensive empirical studies on various
challenging benchmarks across mathematical, coding, and scientific domains
demonstrate $\alpha$1's superior reasoning capability and efficiency. Project

Motivation: 探讨强化学习是否真正扩展语言模型的推理能力，还是仅放大基础模型中已有的高奖励输出。

Method: 引入ProRL方法，结合KL散度控制、参考策略重置和多样化任务集。

Result: RL训练模型在多种评估中优于基础模型，甚至在某些任务上基础模型完全失败。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效拓展语言模型的推理边界，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted
reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with
verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a
model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already
latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL
compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we
challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)
training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base
models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training
methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy
resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that
RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of
pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely
regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary
improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and
training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of
solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions
under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and
establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We
release model weights to support further research:

Motivation: 组合设计领域存在许多未解决的开放性问题，传统方法难以有效解决。论文旨在利用推理LLMs的能力，通过生成和优化搜索启发式方法，填补这一空白。

Method: 采用CPro1协议，结合推理LLMs，从文本定义和验证器出发，指导模型选择并实现策略，同时提供自动化超参数调优和执行反馈。

Result: 成功解决了16个组合设计问题中的7个长期开放实例，包括3个新解决的实例（Bhaskar Rao Designs等），并解决了2025年文献中的多个新问题。

Conclusion: 推理LLMs与CPro1协议的结合，为组合设计领域的开放性问题提供了有效的解决方案，展示了AI在数学问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning are trained to iteratively
generate and refine their answers before finalizing them, which can help with
applications to mathematics and code generation. We apply code generation with
reasoning LLMs to a specific task in the mathematical field of combinatorial
design. This field studies diverse types of combinatorial designs, many of
which have lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been
determined. The Constructive Protocol CPro1 uses LLMs to generate search
heuristics that have the potential to construct solutions to small open
instances. Starting with a textual definition and a validity verifier for a
particular type of design, CPro1 guides LLMs to select and implement
strategies, while providing automated hyperparameter tuning and execution
feedback. CPro1 with reasoning LLMs successfully solves long-standing open
instances for 7 of 16 combinatorial design problems selected from the 2006
Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, including new solved instances for 3 of
these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary
Designs) that were unsolved by CPro1 with non-reasoning LLMs. It also solves
open instances for several problems from recent (2025) literature, generating
new Covering Sequences, Johnson Clique Covers, Deletion Codes, and a Uniform
Nested Steiner Quadruple System.

Conclusion: Workforce为下一代通用AI助手奠定基础，实现了可扩展的模块化跨领域迁移。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for
automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to
their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical
shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining
of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from
specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a
domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask
management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling
capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both
inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to
new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce
Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across
domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning
from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on
the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source
state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like
OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model
achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to
GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization
and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next
generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

Conclusion: 通过经验共享机制，小型LLM团队可以发挥协同效应，在特定任务上超越更大规模的单一模型，为高效利用LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in
different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in
several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code
LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others.
This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents
to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a
priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes
and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the
knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective
solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the
lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team
of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other
multi-LLM collaboration methods.

Abstract: As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging
tasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A
critical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the
environment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal
understanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,
models must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In
particular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond
coherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial
exploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn
multimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,
we particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert
annotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack
such complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at
both global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k
prompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled
preference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal
understanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages
tool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this
goal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting
judges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of
\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the
multi-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can
help facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for materials
science, there is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating their domain-specific
knowledge and complex reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MSQA, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark of 1,757 graduate-level materials
science questions in two formats: detailed explanatory responses and binary
True/False assessments. MSQA distinctively challenges LLMs by requiring both
precise factual knowledge and multi-step reasoning across seven materials
science sub-fields, such as structure-property relationships, synthesis
processes, and computational modeling. Through experiments with 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, we identify significant gaps in current LLM performance.
While API-based proprietary LLMs achieve up to 84.5% accuracy, open-source
(OSS) LLMs peak around 60.5%, and domain-specific LLMs often underperform
significantly due to overfitting and distributional shifts. MSQA represents the
first benchmark to jointly evaluate the factual and reasoning capabilities of
LLMs crucial for LLMs in advanced materials science.

Abstract: To effectively engage in human society, the ability to adapt, filter
information, and make informed decisions in ever-changing situations is
critical. As robots and intelligent agents become more integrated into human
life, there is a growing opportunity-and need-to offload the cognitive burden
on humans to these systems, particularly in dynamic, information-rich
scenarios.
  To fill this critical need, we present Multi-RAG, a multimodal
retrieval-augmented generation system designed to provide adaptive assistance
to humans in information-intensive circumstances. Our system aims to improve
situational understanding and reduce cognitive load by integrating and
reasoning over multi-source information streams, including video, audio, and
text. As an enabling step toward long-term human-robot partnerships, Multi-RAG
explores how multimodal information understanding can serve as a foundation for
adaptive robotic assistance in dynamic, human-centered situations. To evaluate
its capability in a realistic human-assistance proxy task, we benchmarked
Multi-RAG on the MMBench-Video dataset, a challenging multimodal video
understanding benchmark. Our system achieves superior performance compared to
existing open-source video large language models (Video-LLMs) and large

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出GenIC框架，利用大语言模型和知识图谱的文本描述，通过属性预测和链接预测两步完成知识图谱实例补全，实验显示优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全任务中，现代知识库常包含实体描述和类型，这些信息可为推断缺失事实提供上下文。利用大语言模型从文本中提取事实并识别图谱模式，能有效提升补全效果。

Method: 提出GenIC框架：第一步将属性预测作为多标签分类任务，第二步将链接预测建模为生成式序列到序列任务，结合大语言模型实现端到端实例补全。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: GenIC通过结合文本描述和大语言模型的能力，显著提升了知识图谱实例补全的性能，为后续研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion aims to address the gaps of knowledge bases by
adding new triples that represent facts. The complexity of this task depends on
how many parts of a triple are already known. Instance completion involves
predicting the relation-tail pair when only the head is given (h, ?, ?).
Notably, modern knowledge bases often contain entity descriptions and types,
which can provide valuable context for inferring missing facts. By leveraging
these textual descriptions and the ability of large language models to extract
facts from them and recognize patterns within the knowledge graph schema, we
propose an LLM-powered, end-to-end instance completion approach. Specifically,
we introduce GenIC: a two-step Generative Instance Completion framework. The
first step focuses on property prediction, treated as a multi-label
classification task. The second step is link prediction, framed as a generative
sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results on three datasets show that our
method outperforms existing baselines. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SEFT的新方法，专门用于稀疏大型语言模型（LLMs）的微调，通过动态调整稀疏拓扑结构，在保持稀疏性的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个任务中表现优异，但其庞大的计算需求限制了部署。现有的剪枝方法在高稀疏度下难以保持性能，而微调方法又不适合稀疏LLMs。因此，需要一种能够在微调过程中保持稀疏性并提升性能的方法。

Method: SEFT（Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning）方法通过动态演化稀疏拓扑结构，采用权重丢弃与增长策略，使剪枝后的模型能够根据目标数据集自适应稀疏连接模式，并使用敏感性驱动的剪枝准则保持稀疏度。

Result: 实验表明，SEFT在LLaMA、DeepSeek和Mistral等多种LLMs上表现优异，相比现有基线方法，在性能和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SEFT是一种高效且适用于稀疏LLMs的微调方法，能够在保持稀疏性的同时提升模型性能，为LLMs的部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks but face deployment challenges due to their massive computational
demands. While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can
effectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance
at high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing
fine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve
sparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for
sparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a
novel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves
the sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the
overall sparsity throughout the process. The strengths of SEFT lie in its
ability to perform task-specific adaptation through a weight drop-and-grow
strategy, enabling the pruned model to self-adapt its sparse connectivity
pattern based on the target dataset. Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning
criterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently
maintained throughout fine-tuning. Our experiments on various LLMs, including
LLaMA families, DeepSeek, and Mistral, across a diverse set of benchmarks
demonstrate that SEFT achieves stronger performance while offering superior
memory and time efficiency compared to existing baselines. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/QiaoXiao7282/SEFT.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的多模态检索增强生成（RAG）流程，通过优化检索、重排序和生成阶段，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在动态现实应用中受限于静态训练数据、易产生幻觉且无法验证最新外部证据，检索增强生成（RAG）通过访问大规模知识库为其提供解决方案。

Method: 论文系统研究了多模态RAG流程的三个阶段：检索阶段的模态配置和策略、重排序阶段的位置偏差缓解和证据相关性提升、生成阶段的候选信息整合，并探索了通过自反思统一重排序和生成的代理框架。

Result: 该方法在不进行微调的情况下，平均性能提升了5%。

Conclusion: 论文通过全面探索RAG在LVLMs中的应用，显著提升了模型性能，为动态现实应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and
complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data,
susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against
up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic
real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a
practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access
large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding
model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this
paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG
pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the
modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on
strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved
evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best
integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we
extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and
generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence
and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG
for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance
boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

TL;DR: Flow CoT提出了一种递归推理范式，通过SCOUT框架实现无需预训练的渐进式推理优化，在多个基准测试中提升了准确性和解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT方法依赖中间推理步骤，限制了扩展性和泛化能力。递归推理虽有望解决这一问题，但缺乏理论框架且需昂贵预训练。

Method: 提出Flow CoT将递归推理建模为潜在认知状态的渐进轨迹，并设计SCOUT框架：通过渐进蒸馏对齐迭代认知阶段，利用跨注意力回顾模块整合历史输出。

Result: 在8个推理基准上实现最高1.8%的准确率提升，定性分析显示迭代中信念形成和解释粒度得到渐进深化。

Conclusion: SCOUT验证了Flow CoT作为可扩展推理增强框架的有效性，为LLMs提供了无需显式监督的渐进推理解决方案。

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting improves the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by encouraging step by step thinking. However, CoT-based
methods depend on intermediate reasoning steps, which limits scalability and
generalization. Recent work explores recursive reasoning, where LLMs reuse
internal layers across iterations to refine latent representations without
explicit CoT supervision. While promising, these approaches often require
costly pretraining and lack a principled framework for how reasoning should
evolve across iterations. We address this gap by introducing Flow Chain of
Thought (Flow CoT), a reasoning paradigm that models recursive inference as a
progressive trajectory of latent cognitive states. Flow CoT frames each
iteration as a distinct cognitive stage deepening reasoning across iterations
without relying on manual supervision. To realize this, we propose SCOUT
(Stepwise Cognitive Optimization Using Teachers), a lightweight fine tuning
framework that enables Flow CoT style reasoning without the need for
pretraining. SCOUT uses progressive distillation to align each iteration with a
teacher of appropriate capacity, and a cross attention based retrospective
module that integrates outputs from previous iterations while preserving the
models original computation flow. Experiments across eight reasoning benchmarks
show that SCOUT consistently improves both accuracy and explanation quality,
achieving up to 1.8% gains under fine tuning. Qualitative analyses further
reveal that SCOUT enables progressively deeper reasoning across iterations
refining both belief formation and explanation granularity. These results not
only validate the effectiveness of SCOUT, but also demonstrate the practical
viability of Flow CoT as a scalable framework for enhancing reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于API的数字工具代理常依赖文档理解功能，但文档常缺失、过时或私有化，限制了通用代理的发展。

Method: 从专家代理和自主探索中收集API演示，研究演示数量、LLM生成的摘要和评价对任务成功率的影响。

Result: 实验表明，即使先进LLM从演示学习API功能仍具挑战，但显式函数调用和自然语言评价能显著提升参数填写的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了无文档API代理的关键挑战，为未来自改进代理的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Digital tool-based agents that invoke external Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) often rely on documentation to understand API functionality.
However, such documentation is frequently missing, outdated, privatized, or
inconsistent-hindering the development of reliable, general-purpose agents. In
this work, we propose learning API functionality directly from demonstrations
as a new paradigm applicable in scenarios without documentation. Using existing
API benchmarks, we collect demonstrations from both expert API-based agents and
from self-exploration. To understand what information demonstrations must
convey for successful task completion, we extensively study how the number of
demonstrations and the use of LLM-generated summaries and evaluations affect
the task success rate of the API-based agent. Our experiments across 3 datasets
and 5 models show that learning functionality from demonstrations remains a
non-trivial challenge, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. We find that providing
explicit function calls and natural language critiques significantly improves
the agent's task success rate due to more accurate parameter filling. We
analyze failure modes, identify sources of error, and highlight key open
challenges for future work in documentation-free, self-improving, API-based
agents.

Result: 在邮件助手和Magentic-One系统中验证了框架对隐蔽风险、多智能体共谋等复杂威胁的检测能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信、可监控的多智能体AI生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rise of large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS)
introduces new security and reliability challenges. While these systems show
great promise in decomposing and coordinating complex tasks, they also face
multi-faceted risks across prompt manipulation, unsafe tool usage, and emergent
agent miscoordination. Existing guardrail mechanisms offer only partial
protection, primarily at the input-output level, and fall short in addressing
systemic or multi-point failures in MAS. In this work, we present a
system-level anomaly detection framework tailored for MAS, integrating
structural modeling with runtime behavioral oversight. Our approach consists of
two components. First, we propose a graph-based framework that models agent
interactions as dynamic execution graphs, enabling semantic anomaly detection
at node, edge, and path levels. Second, we introduce a pluggable SentinelAgent,
an LLM-powered oversight agent that observes, analyzes, and intervenes in MAS
execution based on security policies and contextual reasoning. By bridging
abstract detection logic with actionable enforcement, our method detects not
only single-point faults and prompt injections but also multi-agent collusion
and latent exploit paths. We validate our framework through two case studies,
including an email assistant and Microsoft's Magentic-One system, demonstrating
its ability to detect covert risks and provide explainable root-cause
attribution. Our work lays the foundation for more trustworthy, monitorable,
and secure agent-based AI ecosystems.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型(VLMs)的安全性与模态差距高度负相关，提出预训练阶段的正则化方法降低模态差距，显著提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型(LVLMs)相比纯文本模型存在严重安全性退化问题，甚至无关图像会触发有害响应。论文旨在探究模态差距对安全性的影响机制。

Method: 通过分析模态差距与安全性的相关性，提出在预训练阶段引入正则化方法缩小图像与文本表征的模态差距。

Result: 在LLaVA等模型上验证，新方法最高降低16.3%的不安全率，且不影响性能，还能将现有防御效果提升18.2%。

Conclusion: 模态差距是影响LVLMs安全性的关键因素，预训练阶段的正则化干预能有效提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate safe outputs is crucial for
their reliable deployment. However, LVLMs suffer from drastic safety
degradation compared to their LLM backbone. Even blank or irrelevant images can
trigger LVLMs to generate harmful responses to prompts that would otherwise be
refused in text-only contexts. The modality gap between image and text
representations has been recently hypothesized to contribute to safety
degradation of LVLMs. However, if and how the amount of modality gap affects
LVLMs' safety is not studied. In this work, we show that the amount of modality
gap is highly inversely correlated with VLMs' safety. Then, we show that this
modality gap is introduced during pretraining LVLMs and persists through
fine-tuning. Inspired by this observation, we propose a regularization to
reduce the modality gap during pretraining. Our extensive experiments on LLaVA
v1.5, ShareGPT4V, and MiniGPT-4 show that our method substantially improves
safety alignment of LVLMs, reducing unsafe rate by up to 16.3% without
compromising performance, and can further boost existing defenses by up to
18.2%.

Motivation: 现有的图基RAG方法（如GraphRAG）虽然能全局理解知识库，但效率低下且依赖手动预定义查询模式，限制了实际应用。

Method: E^2GraphRAG在索引阶段使用大语言模型构建摘要树和基于SpaCy的实体图，并建立实体与文本块的双向索引；检索阶段采用自适应策略选择局部或全局模式。

Result: 实验表明，E^2GraphRAG索引速度比GraphRAG快10倍，检索速度比LightRAG快100倍，同时保持竞争力的问答性能。

Conclusion: E^2GraphRAG通过优化索引和检索流程，显著提升了图基RAG的效率和实用性，为知识库问答提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG methods like GraphRAG have shown promising global
understanding of the knowledge base by constructing hierarchical entity graphs.
However, they often suffer from inefficiency and rely on manually pre-defined
query modes, limiting practical use. In this paper, we propose E^2GraphRAG, a
streamlined graph-based RAG framework that improves both Efficiency and
Effectiveness. During the indexing stage, E^2GraphRAG constructs a summary tree
with large language models and an entity graph with SpaCy based on document
chunks. We then construct bidirectional indexes between entities and chunks to
capture their many-to-many relationships, enabling fast lookup during both
local and global retrieval. For the retrieval stage, we design an adaptive
retrieval strategy that leverages the graph structure to retrieve and select
between local and global modes. Experiments show that E^2GraphRAG achieves up
to 10 times faster indexing than GraphRAG and 100 times speedup over LightRAG
in retrieval while maintaining competitive QA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言和编程语言处理上表现优异，但它们在数据流推理方面的能力尚未得到系统评估。

Method: FABLE基准测试采用八种经典数据流分析技术，在三个实际领域（烹饪食谱、旅行路线和自动化计划）中实例化，包含2400个问答对。评估了三种类型的大语言模型。

Result: 推理模型（DeepSeek-R1 8B）准确率更高，但推理速度比其他模型慢20倍以上；通用模型（LLaMA 3.1 8B）和代码模型（Granite Code 8B）表现接近随机。

Conclusion: FABLE是首个系统性评估数据流推理的诊断基准，为开发具有更强程序理解能力的模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how data moves, transforms, and persists, known as data flow,
is fundamental to reasoning in procedural tasks. Despite their fluency in
natural and programming languages, large language models (LLMs), although
increasingly being applied to decisions with procedural tasks, have not been
systematically evaluated for their ability to perform data-flow reasoning. We
introduce FABLE, an extensible benchmark designed to assess LLMs' understanding
of data flow using structured, procedural text. FABLE adapts eight classical
data-flow analyses from software engineering: reaching definitions, very busy
expressions, available expressions, live variable analysis, interval analysis,
type-state analysis, taint analysis, and concurrency analysis. These analyses
are instantiated across three real-world domains: cooking recipes, travel
routes, and automated plans. The benchmark includes 2,400 question-answer
pairs, with 100 examples for each domain-analysis combination. We evaluate
three types of LLMs: a reasoning-focused model (DeepSeek-R1 8B), a
general-purpose model (LLaMA 3.1 8B), and a code-specific model (Granite Code
8B). Each model is tested using majority voting over five sampled completions
per prompt. Results show that the reasoning model achieves higher accuracy, but
at the cost of over 20 times slower inference compared to the other models. In
contrast, the general-purpose and code-specific models perform close to random
chance. FABLE provides the first diagnostic benchmark to systematically
evaluate data-flow reasoning and offers insights for developing models with
stronger procedural understanding.

Abstract: Urban design is a multifaceted process that demands careful consideration of
site-specific constraints and collaboration among diverse professionals and
stakeholders. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers
transformative potential by improving the efficiency of design generation and
facilitating the communication of design ideas. However, most existing
approaches are not well integrated with human design workflows. They often
follow end-to-end pipelines with limited control, overlooking the iterative
nature of real-world design. This study proposes a stepwise generative urban
design framework that integrates multimodal diffusion models with human
expertise to enable more adaptive and controllable design processes. Instead of
generating design outcomes in a single end-to-end process, the framework
divides the process into three key stages aligned with established urban design
workflows: (1) road network and land use planning, (2) building layout
planning, and (3) detailed planning and rendering. At each stage, multimodal
diffusion models generate preliminary designs based on textual prompts and
image-based constraints, which can then be reviewed and refined by human
designers. We design an evaluation framework to assess the fidelity,
compliance, and diversity of the generated designs. Experiments using data from
Chicago and New York City demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline
models and end-to-end approaches across all three dimensions. This study
underscores the benefits of multimodal diffusion models and stepwise generation
in preserving human control and facilitating iterative refinements, laying the
groundwork for human-AI interaction in urban design solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，长链思维（CoT）与回溯步骤能提升大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，尤其在复杂任务中效果显著，但RL训练更关注结构而非内容正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习（RL）能内化搜索策略并自然习得回溯能力，但回溯对推理改进的具体贡献及最佳使用程度尚不明确。本文旨在系统研究监督微调（SFT）与RL在八项推理任务中的动态关系，并探索回溯的作用。

Method: 在八项推理任务（如数独、几何等）上对比SFT与RL的效果，构建不同回溯步数的合成数据集，通过控制实验分离内容正确性与结构（回溯频率）的影响。

Result: 1. 长CoT与回溯通常能带来更优且稳定的RL训练；2. 搜索空间更大的难题需更多回溯步骤；3. RL训练对长CoT序列的内容正确性不敏感，更关注结构模式。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效LLM推理训练策略提供实用洞见：应优先优化CoT结构（如回溯频率），而非过度依赖内容正确性。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively
improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical
problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised
finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that
RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability.
However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly
it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use,
remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the
dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc
1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self
Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a
warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start
RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly
difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets
varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct
controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness
(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer
CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)
more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers
of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through
experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the
correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural
patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical
insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale
reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: QuAda为AI对话中的引用处理提供了轻量级且有效的解决方案，显著提升了模型在引用感知任务上的表现。

Abstract: Human-AI conversation frequently relies on quoting earlier text-"check it
with the formula I just highlighted"-yet today's large language models (LLMs)
lack an explicit mechanism for locating and exploiting such spans. We formalise
the challenge as span-conditioned generation, decomposing each turn into the
dialogue history, a set of token-offset quotation spans, and an intent
utterance. Building on this abstraction, we introduce a quotation-centric data
pipeline that automatically synthesises task-specific dialogues, verifies
answer correctness through multi-stage consistency checks, and yields both a
heterogeneous training corpus and the first benchmark covering five
representative scenarios. To meet the benchmark's zero-overhead and
parameter-efficiency requirements, we propose QuAda, a lightweight
training-based method that attaches two bottleneck projections to every
attention head, dynamically amplifying or suppressing attention to quoted spans
at inference time while leaving the prompt unchanged and updating < 2.8% of
backbone weights. Experiments across models show that QuAda is suitable for all
scenarios and generalises to unseen topics, offering an effective,
plug-and-play solution for quotation-aware dialogue.

classical pathfinding algorithms. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs'
independent reasoning capabilities and overlook the potential synergy between
LLMs and traditional algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive
evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of
traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique
called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms'
guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to
72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in
correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying
sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all
model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a
promising approach to addressing path planning challenges. Our code is

Motivation: 研究人工智能领域中知识处理的基础问题，特别是对否定的理解、区分和计算，以提升知识表达的准确性和计算效率。

Method: 通过分析哲学、逻辑学和语言学等领域中的否定概念，区分矛盾和对立，提出三种否定类型，并引入SCOI和LCOI作为数学和逻辑基础。

Result: 证明了SCOI的主要运算性质和LCOI的形式推理关系，为不同类型的否定建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文通过分类和数学建模，为知识处理中的否定问题提供了系统的解决方案，推动了人工智能领域的基础研究。

Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, understanding, distinguishing,
expressing, and computing the negation in knowledge is a fundamental issue in
knowledge processing and research. In this paper, we examine and analyze the
understanding and characteristics of negation in various fields such as
philosophy, logic, and linguistics etc. Based on the distinction between the
concepts of contradiction and opposition, we propose that there are three
different types of negation in knowledge from a conceptual perspective:
contradictory negation, opposite negation, and intermediary negation. To
establish a mathematical foundation that fully reflects the intrinsic
connections, properties, and laws of these different forms of negation, we
introduce SCOI: sets with contradictory negation, opposite negation and
intermediary negation, and LCOI: logic with contradictory negation, opposite
negation and intermediary negation, and we proved the main operational
properties of SCOI as well as the formal inference relations in LCOI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统虽能模拟人类智能行为，但缺乏统一的智能定义和度量标准，无法在单一尺度上比较不同实体的智能。

Method: 通过预测准确性（结合Kolmogorov复杂度衡量预测与环境复杂性）构建智能度量算法，并在虚拟迷宫和时间序列预测场景中验证。

Result: 实验证明该方法可有效测量虚拟迷宫智能体和时间序列预测智能体的智能水平。

Conclusion: 该通用智能度量有望成为比较人类、动物与AI智能的科学基准。

Abstract: Over the last thirty years, considerable progress has been made with the
development of systems that can drive cars, play games, predict protein folding
and generate natural language. These systems are described as intelligent and
there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial
intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding
of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for
building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly
agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess.
No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the
intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.
  This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on
the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence.
As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its
predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived
environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were
carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These
demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a
virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This
universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of
intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.

Conclusion: RMoA有效提升了多智能体系统的效率和可靠性，适用于多种任务场景。

Abstract: Although multi-agent systems based on large language models show strong
capabilities on multiple tasks, they are still limited by high computational
overhead, information loss, and robustness. Inspired by ResNet's residual
learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual
connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information
utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we
innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that
greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate
iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to
preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response
differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical
information integration. Additionally, we propose an adaptive termination
mechanism that dynamically halts processing based on residual convergence,
further improving inference efficiency. RMoA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the benchmarks of across alignment, mathematical reasoning, code
generation, and multitasking understanding, while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Code is available at

Abstract: The SEAR Dataset is a novel multimodal resource designed to study the
emerging threat of social engineering (SE) attacks orchestrated through
augmented reality (AR) and multimodal large language models (LLMs). This
dataset captures 180 annotated conversations across 60 participants in
simulated adversarial scenarios, including meetings, classes and networking

assessments. Key findings reveal SEAR's alarming efficacy in eliciting
compliance (e.g., 93.3% phishing link clicks, 85% call acceptance) and
hijacking trust (76.7% post-interaction trust surge). The dataset supports
research in detecting AR-driven SE attacks, designing defensive frameworks, and
understanding multimodal adversarial manipulation. Rigorous ethical safeguards,
including anonymization and IRB compliance, ensure responsible use. The SEAR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前，LLMs与KGs结合的系统在检索增强生成中日益普遍，但系统化的超参数优化作用尚未充分探索。论文旨在填补这一空白，探究超参数调优对性能的影响。

Method: 研究使用Cognee框架，针对三个多跳问答基准（HotPotQA、TwoWikiMultiHop和MuSiQue），优化与分块、图构建、检索和提示相关的参数，并通过精确匹配、F1和DeepEval的LLM-based正确性指标进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，针对性调优能带来显著性能提升，但提升幅度因数据集和评估指标而异，凸显了调优的价值和标准评估指标的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文指出，未来进展不仅依赖于架构改进，还需建立更清晰的优化和评估框架，以应对复杂模块化系统的挑战。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) results
in complex systems with numerous hyperparameters that directly affect
performance. While such systems are increasingly common in retrieval-augmented
generation, the role of systematic hyperparameter optimization remains
underexplored. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of Cognee, a
modular framework for end-to-end KG construction and retrieval. Using three
multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotPotQA, TwoWikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue) we optimize
parameters related to chunking, graph construction, retrieval, and prompting.
Each configuration is scored using established metrics (exact match, F1, and
DeepEval's LLM-based correctness metric). Our results demonstrate that
meaningful gains can be achieved through targeted tuning. While the gains are
consistent, they are not uniform, with performance varying across datasets and
metrics. This variability highlights both the value of tuning and the
limitations of standard evaluation measures. While demonstrating the immediate
potential of hyperparameter tuning, we argue that future progress will depend
not only on architectural advances but also on clearer frameworks for
optimization and evaluation in complex, modular systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用知识图谱（KGs）系统生成虚假三元组的方法，通过分析KGs的结构特性生成不同可信度的虚假信息，并探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在识别真假信息方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的快速发展，错误信息的迅速传播对社会、公众舆论、民主稳定和国家安全构成重大威胁。为了理解和主动评估这些威胁，需要探索能够结构化、规模化生成错误信息的方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种新颖方法，利用知识图谱（KGs）作为结构化语义资源，通过分析实体间距离及其谓词等结构特性，生成看似合理的虚假关系三元组，并以此引导大语言模型（LLMs）生成不同可信度的虚假信息。

Result: 研究结果表明，该方法生成的虚假信息对人类具有较高的欺骗性，同时揭示了当前基于LLMs的检测方法在识别真假信息方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了增强检测策略和深入探索生成模型内在偏见的必要性，以应对日益复杂的虚假信息威胁。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in
generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion,
democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively
assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured
and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources
to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural
properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates,
we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to
guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with
varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships,
our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for
humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g.,
WikiGraphs).
  Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing
between genuine and artificially generated misinformation. Our analysis
highlights significant limitations in current LLM-based detection methods,
underscoring the necessity for enhanced detection strategies and a deeper
exploration of inherent biases in generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别（SER）的标注成本高且存在不一致性，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本数据标注中展现出潜力。论文旨在研究LLMs是否能在无需人工监督的情况下标注语音情感数据。

Method: 使用GPT-4o仅基于文本提示对《老友记》多模态数据集进行标注，提出MELT数据集，并通过微调四种自监督学习（SSL）模型评估其性能。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-4o生成的标注具有准确性和上下文相关性，MELT数据集在SER任务中表现一致优于其他数据集。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够有效替代人工标注语音情感数据，MELT数据集为SER研究提供了高质量且可扩展的标注资源。

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) has advanced significantly with
deep learning, annotation remains a major hurdle. Human annotation is not only
costly but also subject to inconsistencies annotators often have different
preferences and may lack the necessary contextual knowledge, which can lead to
varied and inaccurate labels. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
emerged as a scalable alternative for annotating text data. However, the
potential of LLMs to perform emotional speech data annotation without human
supervision has yet to be thoroughly investigated. To address these problems,
we apply GPT-4o to annotate a multimodal dataset collected from the sitcom
Friends, using only textual cues as inputs. By crafting structured text
prompts, our methodology capitalizes on the knowledge GPT-4o has accumulated
during its training, showcasing that it can generate accurate and contextually
relevant annotations without direct access to multimodal inputs. Therefore, we
propose MELT, a multimodal emotion dataset fully annotated by GPT-4o. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of MELT by fine-tuning four self-supervised
learning (SSL) backbones and assessing speech emotion recognition performance
across emotion datasets. Additionally, our subjective experiments\' results
demonstrate a consistence performance improvement on SER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置预测方法难以捕捉真实场景中地点的多功能语义，且无法建模不同用户群体的异构行为动态。

Method: 采用双层级MoE架构：Location Semantics MoE编码地点功能语义，Personalized MoE适配用户移动模式，并引入历史感知路由机制优化专家选择。

Result: 在多个城市数据集上验证，NextLocMoE在预测准确性、跨领域泛化性和可解释性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: NextLocMoE通过语义与个性化建模的结合，显著提升了下一位置预测的性能。

Abstract: Next location prediction plays a critical role in understanding human
mobility patterns. However, existing approaches face two core limitations: (1)
they fall short in capturing the complex, multi-functional semantics of
real-world locations; and (2) they lack the capacity to model heterogeneous
behavioral dynamics across diverse user groups. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce NextLocMoE, a novel framework built upon large language models (LLMs)
and structured around a dual-level Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Our
architecture comprises two specialized modules: a Location Semantics MoE that
operates at the embedding level to encode rich functional semantics of
locations, and a Personalized MoE embedded within the Transformer backbone to
dynamically adapt to individual user mobility patterns. In addition, we
incorporate a history-aware routing mechanism that leverages long-term
trajectory data to enhance expert selection and ensure prediction stability.
Empirical evaluations across several real-world urban datasets show that
NextLocMoE achieves superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy,
cross-domain generalization, and interpretability

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a \textbf{neuro-symbolic pair} -- neural and
symbolic approaches that are linked through a common knowledge representation.
Next, we present \textbf{taxonomic networks}, a type of discrimination network
in which nodes represent hierarchically organized taxonomic concepts. Using
this representation, we construct a novel neuro-symbolic pair and evaluate its
performance. We show that our symbolic method learns taxonomic nets more
efficiently with less data and compute, while the neural method finds
higher-accuracy taxonomic nets when provided with greater resources. As a
neuro-symbolic pair, these approaches can be used interchangeably based on
situational needs, with seamless translation between them when necessary. This
work lays the foundation for future systems that more fundamentally integrate
neural and symbolic computation.

Motivation: 初创企业成功预测需要兼具高准确性和可解释性的模型，传统方法往往缺乏透明度。研究旨在结合大语言模型的推理能力与人类专家知识，构建简单透明的决策工具以支持风投等高风险决策。

Method: 1. 利用大语言模型生成大量是/否问题作为弱启发式规则

- 全程保持决策过程透明

Conclusion: 大语言模型与人类洞察力的结合能有效提升预测性能，证明简单的可解释集成方法可支持高风险决策，为风投等领域提供实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting startup success requires models that are both accurate and
interpretable. We present a lightweight ensemble framework that combines YES/NO
questions generated by large language models (LLMs), forming a transparent
decision-making system. Each question acts as a weak heuristic, and by
filtering, ranking, and aggregating them through a threshold-based voting
mechanism, we construct a strong ensemble predictor. On a test set where 10% of
startups are classified as successful, our approach achieves a precision rate
of 50%, representing a 5x improvement over random selection, while remaining
fully transparent. When we incorporate expert-guided heuristics into the
generation process, performance improves further to 54% precision. These
results highlight the value of combining LLM reasoning with human insight and
demonstrate that simple, interpretable ensembles can support high-stakes
decisions in domains such as venture capital (VC).

Motivation: 现有心血管疾病风险预测模型过于简化患者信息，依赖固定输入模式，且对数据分布变化敏感，难以适应真实临床需求。

Method: 基于UK Biobank超过50万参与者的数据，对大语言模型进行微调，开发了AdaCVD框架，支持结构化和非结构化数据输入。

Result: AdaCVD在基准测试中超越了传统风险评分和标准机器学习方法，在不同人群和亚组中均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdaCVD为异质性和动态医疗环境提供了更灵活、AI驱动的临床决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction models are essential for
identifying high-risk individuals and guiding preventive actions. However,
existing models struggle with the challenges of real-world clinical practice as
they oversimplify patient profiles, rely on rigid input schemas, and are
sensitive to distribution shifts. We developed AdaCVD, an adaptable CVD risk
prediction framework built on large language models extensively fine-tuned on
over half a million participants from the UK Biobank. In benchmark comparisons,
AdaCVD surpasses established risk scores and standard machine learning
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, for the first
time, it addresses key clinical challenges across three dimensions: it flexibly
incorporates comprehensive yet variable patient information; it seamlessly
integrates both structured data and unstructured text; and it rapidly adapts to
new patient populations using minimal additional data. In stratified analyses,
it demonstrates robust performance across demographic, socioeconomic, and
clinical subgroups, including underrepresented cohorts. AdaCVD offers a
promising path toward more flexible, AI-driven clinical decision support tools
suited to the realities of heterogeneous and dynamic healthcare environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合主动推理和深度强化学习的新架构AXIOM，通过引入核心先验知识提升数据效率，在低数据量下实现快速学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度强化学习（DRL）在数据效率上不如人类学习，后者能利用物体及其交互的核心先验知识。主动推理虽能结合先验知识量化不确定性，但通常局限于单一任务。本文旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 提出AXIOM架构，整合物体中心动态和交互的核心先验，以贝叶斯方法建模场景为物体组合，动态采用分段线性轨迹捕捉稀疏交互，并通过在线混合模型学习和贝叶斯模型简化实现泛化。

Result: AXIOM仅需10,000次交互步骤即可掌握多种游戏，参数数量少且无需梯度优化，兼具贝叶斯方法的数据效率、可解释性和DRL的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: AXIOM成功融合了贝叶斯推理与DRL的优势，为低数据量下的高效学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art
performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to
human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their
interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating
sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify
the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference
models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they
lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we
propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of
core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate
learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM,
combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches
with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM
represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as
piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions.
The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and
learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through
Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games
within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters
compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based
optimization.

Abstract: Automating AI research holds immense potential for accelerating scientific

end-to-end experimentation. We introduce EXP-Bench, a novel benchmark designed
to systematically evaluate AI agents on complete research experiments sourced
from influential AI publications. Given a research question and incomplete
starter code, EXP-Bench challenges AI agents to formulate hypotheses, design
and implement experimental procedures, execute them, and analyze results. To
enable the creation of such intricate and authentic tasks with high-fidelity,
we design a semi-autonomous pipeline to extract and structure crucial
experimental details from these research papers and their associated
open-source code. With the pipeline, EXP-Bench curated 461 AI research tasks
from 51 top-tier AI research papers. Evaluations of leading LLM-based agents,
such as OpenHands and IterativeAgent on EXP-Bench demonstrate partial
capabilities: while scores on individual experimental aspects such as design or
implementation correctness occasionally reach 20-35%, the success rate for
complete, executable experiments was a mere 0.5%. By identifying these
bottlenecks and providing realistic step-by-step experiment procedures,
EXP-Bench serves as a vital tool for future AI agents to improve their ability

TL;DR: MiCRo框架通过两阶段方法提升个性化偏好学习，无需细粒度标注即可捕捉多样化人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于Bradley-Terry模型的奖励建模假设全局奖励函数，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样性和异质性，限制了大型语言模型的个性化和多元化对齐能力。

Method: MiCRo采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过上下文感知混合建模捕捉多样化偏好；第二阶段通过在线路由策略动态调整混合权重，以最小监督实现高效偏好适应。

Result: 实验表明，MiCRo能有效捕捉多样化人类偏好，显著提升下游个性化任务表现。

Conclusion: MiCRo为无需细粒度标注的个性化偏好学习提供了高效解决方案，推动了大型语言模型的多元化对齐。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when
applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry
(BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently
diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification
limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.
Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture
distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.
While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained
annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by
predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.
In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances
personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference
datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first
stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture
diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online
routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific
context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference
adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple
preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human
preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Open CaptchaWorld，首个基于网页的基准测试平台，用于评估多模态大语言模型代理在解决多样化动态CAPTCHA谜题时的视觉推理和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHAs已成为网页代理在现实应用中部署的关键瓶颈，阻碍其完成端到端自动化任务。尽管现代多模态大语言模型代理在静态感知任务中表现出色，但其处理交互式、多步推理挑战（如CAPTCHAs）的能力尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 研究团队开发了Open CaptchaWorld基准测试平台，涵盖20种现代CAPTCHA类型，共225个CAPTCHA，并提出了新指标CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth，量化解决每个谜题所需的认知和操作步骤。

Result: 实验结果显示，人类表现接近完美（93.3%），而最先进的多模态大语言模型代理成功率最高仅为40.0%，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: Open CaptchaWorld作为重要基准，有助于诊断当前多模态代理的局限性，并指导开发更强大的多模态推理系统。

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in
real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end
automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated
impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle
interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.
To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based
benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning
and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic
CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225
CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,
which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each
puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect
scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates
at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,
93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing
the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more
robust multimodal reasoning systems. Code and Data are available at this https

*Bettina Fazzinga,Sergio Flesca,Filippo Furfaro,Luigi Pontieri,Francesco Scala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合神经符号方法的高效数据处理方法，用于解决过程追踪中事件与业务活动映射不确定的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代企业在监控和分析过程追踪时，常面临事件与业务活动映射不确定的问题，导致解释困难。传统基于推理的方法在高度不确定的情况下可能效果不佳且计算量大，而纯数据驱动方法又需要大量标注数据。因此，需要一种高效、环保的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了一种神经符号方法，结合序列标记模型和基于抽象论证框架（AAF）的推理器。序列标记模型提供高概率的事件解释候选，AAF推理器则利用先验知识优化这些候选，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在数据稀缺的情况下有效利用先验知识，显著提升事件解释的准确性，同时降低计算成本和碳足迹。

Conclusion: 该神经符号方法不仅解决了事件解释的难题，还符合绿色AI的要求，适用于标注数据和计算资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern
companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace
events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation
problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the
corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that
frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract
Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event
interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations
for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where
event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this
reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy
computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to
suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.
However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of
manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing
Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with
reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a
data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the
candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is
refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior
knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by
experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings
where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent
constraints.

Motivation: 现实应用中，智能体常面临部分状态观测的挑战，需基于历史观测进行决策，但现有方法在表达能力和稳定性上存在不足。

Method: 提出OPMDP框架扩展标准MDP，并设计DATD3算法，结合深度可分离卷积和多头注意力机制编码历史观测，避免循环模型的不稳定性。

Result: 在连续控制任务上的实验显示，DATD3在部分和完全可观测环境下均优于基于记忆和循环的基线方法。

Conclusion: DATD3通过新颖的编码方法在保持策略表达能力的同时提升了稳定性，为部分可观测环境下的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in real-world applications often involves
output-feedback settings, where the agent receives only partial state
information. To address this challenge, we propose the Output-Feedback Markov
Decision Process (OPMDP), which extends the standard MDP formulation to
accommodate decision-making based on observation histories. Building on this
framework, we introduce Depthwise Attention Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DATD3), a novel actor-critic algorithm that employs depthwise
separable convolution and multi-head attention to encode historical
observations. DATD3 maintains policy expressiveness while avoiding the
instability of recurrent models. Extensive experiments on continuous control
tasks demonstrate that DATD3 outperforms existing memory-based and recurrent
baselines under both partial and full observability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LOT Merging的新方法，通过逐层最小化特征漂移来高效合并多任务模型，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在合并多任务模型时存在性能差距大或二次训练成本高的问题，而特征漂移与性能下降密切相关。

Method: 提出LOT Merging技术，将模型合并问题转化为凸二次优化问题，逐层最小化特征漂移，并通过解析解高效合并模型。

Result: 在视觉和视觉语言基准测试中，LOT Merging比现有方法性能提升高达4.4%（ViT-B/32）。

Conclusion: LOT Merging通过优化特征漂移实现了高效且高性能的多任务模型合并，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-task model merging aims to consolidate knowledge from multiple
fine-tuned task-specific experts into a unified model while minimizing
performance degradation. Existing methods primarily approach this by minimizing
differences between task-specific experts and the unified model, either from a
parameter-level or a task-loss perspective. However, parameter-level methods
exhibit a significant performance gap compared to the upper bound, while
task-loss approaches entail costly secondary training procedures. In contrast,
we observe that performance degradation closely correlates with feature drift,
i.e., differences in feature representations of the same sample caused by model
merging. Motivated by this observation, we propose Layer-wise Optimal Task
Vector Merging (LOT Merging), a technique that explicitly minimizes feature
drift between task-specific experts and the unified model in a layer-by-layer
manner. LOT Merging can be formulated as a convex quadratic optimization
problem, enabling us to analytically derive closed-form solutions for the
parameters of linear and normalization layers. Consequently, LOT Merging
achieves efficient model consolidation through basic matrix operations.
Extensive experiments across vision and vision-language benchmarks demonstrate
that LOT Merging significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving
improvements of up to 4.4% (ViT-B/32) over state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的药物重定位方法主要依赖图表示，但在涉及新药物的冷启动场景中，由于缺乏与疾病的关联信息，这些方法难以进行有效推断。因此，需要一种新的方法来克服这一限制。

Method: BiBLDR将药物重定位重新定义为行为序列学习任务，首先构建基于药物和疾病的双向行为序列，然后通过两阶段策略：第一阶段构建原型空间表征药物和疾病的属性，第二阶段利用这些原型和双向行为序列数据预测潜在的药物-疾病关联。

Result: 实验表明，BiBLDR在基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并且在冷启动场景中显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: BiBLDR通过双向行为序列学习，能够更稳健和精确地捕捉药物与疾病特征之间的交互关系，为药物重定位提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Drug repositioning aims to identify potential new indications for existing
drugs to reduce the time and financial costs associated with developing new
drugs. Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods
predominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug
repositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start
scenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information
with the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a
bidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as
BiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior
sequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,
we construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease
sides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous
and rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we
construct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of
drugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and
bidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential
drug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more
robustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and
disease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark
datasets. Meanwhile, BiBLDR demonstrates significantly superior performance
compared to previous methods in cold-start scenarios. Our code is published in
https://github.com/Renyeeah/BiBLDR.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems from short-term observations remains
a fundamental and underexplored challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to
initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Existing
approaches often rely on long-term training data or focus on short-term
sequence correlations, struggling to maintain predictive stability and
dynamical coherence over extended horizons. We propose PhyxMamba, a novel
framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed
principles to capture the underlying dynamics of chaotic systems. By
reconstructing the attractor manifold from brief observations using time-delay
embeddings, PhyxMamba extracts global dynamical features essential for accurate
forecasting. Our generative training scheme enables Mamba to replicate the
physical process, augmented by multi-token prediction and attractor geometry
regularization for physical constraints, enhancing prediction accuracy and
preserving key statistical invariants. Extensive evaluations on diverse
simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers
superior long-term forecasting and faithfully captures essential dynamical
invariants from short-term data. This framework opens new avenues for reliably
predicting chaotic systems under observation-scarce conditions, with broad
implications across climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, and beyond.

Conclusion: FedAux通过辅助投影向量有效解决了图联邦学习中的非独立同分布问题，实现了高效的个性化模型聚合与知识迁移。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) on graph-structured data typically faces non-IID
challenges, particularly in scenarios where each client holds a distinct
subgraph sampled from a global graph. In this paper, we introduce Federated
learning with Auxiliary projections (FedAux), a personalized subgraph FL
framework that learns to align, compare, and aggregate heterogeneously
distributed local models without sharing raw data or node embeddings. In
FedAux, each client jointly trains (i) a local GNN and (ii) a learnable
auxiliary projection vector (APV) that differentiably projects node embeddings
onto a 1D space. A soft-sorting operation followed by a lightweight 1D
convolution refines these embeddings in the ordered space, enabling the APV to
effectively capture client-specific information. After local training, these
APVs serve as compact signatures that the server uses to compute inter-client
similarities and perform similarity-weighted parameter mixing, yielding
personalized models while preserving cross-client knowledge transfer. Moreover,
we provide rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the convergence and
rationality of our design. Empirical evaluations across diverse graph
benchmarks demonstrate that FedAux substantially outperforms existing baselines
in both accuracy and personalization performance.

Abstract: Precision agriculture requires efficient autonomous systems for crop
monitoring, where agents must explore large-scale environments while minimizing
resource consumption. This work addresses the problem as an active exploration
task in a grid environment representing an agricultural field. Each cell may
contain targets (e.g., damaged crops) observable from nine predefined points of
view (POVs). Agents must infer the number of targets per cell using partial,
sequential observations.
  We propose a two-stage deep learning framework. A pre-trained LSTM serves as
a belief model, updating a probabilistic map of the environment and its
associated entropy, which defines the expected information gain (IG). This
allows agents to prioritize informative regions. A key contribution is the
inclusion of a POV visibility mask in the input, preserving the Markov property
under partial observability and avoiding revisits to already explored views.
  Three agent architectures were compared: an untrained IG-based agent
selecting actions to maximize entropy reduction; a DQN agent using CNNs over
local 3x3 inputs with belief, entropy, and POV mask; and a Double-CNN DQN agent
with wider spatial context. Simulations on 20x20 maps showed that the untrained
agent performs well despite its simplicity. The DQN agent matches this
performance when the POV mask is included, while the Double-CNN agent
consistently achieves superior exploration efficiency, especially in larger
environments.
  Results show that uncertainty-aware policies leveraging entropy, belief
states, and visibility tracking lead to robust and scalable exploration. Future
work includes curriculum learning, multi-agent cooperation with shared rewards,
transformer-based models, and intrinsic motivation mechanisms to further
enhance learning efficiency and policy generalization.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键应用中存在校准性差和过度自信的问题，可能导致严重后果，需要改进。

Method: 采用锐度感知最小化（SAM）及其变体CSAM，通过隐式最大化预测分布的熵来改善模型校准。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括ImageNet-1K）上的实验显示，SAM和CSAM显著降低了校准误差，CSAM表现更优。

Conclusion: SAM和CSAM能有效提升模型校准性，减少过度自信，CSAM性能优于SAM及其他方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in safety-critical
applications such as medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. However, many
studies suggest that they are prone to being poorly calibrated and have a
propensity for overconfidence, which may have disastrous consequences. In this
paper, unlike standard training such as stochastic gradient descent, we show
that the recently proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) counteracts this
tendency towards overconfidence. The theoretical analysis suggests that SAM
allows us to learn models that are already well-calibrated by implicitly
maximizing the entropy of the predictive distribution. Inspired by this
finding, we further propose a variant of SAM, coined as CSAM, to ameliorate
model calibration. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including
ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the benefits of SAM in reducing calibration error.
Meanwhile, CSAM performs even better than SAM and consistently achieves lower
calibration error than other approaches

Result: 实验表明，LoPE仅通过低成本噪声注入即可实现强大性能和鲁棒性，完全无需数据清洗。

Conclusion: LoPE为噪声鲁棒性适应提供了一种高效且低成本的新方法。

Abstract: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for adapting pre-trained
language models to downstream tasks are susceptible to interference from noisy
data. Conventional noise-handling approaches either rely on laborious data
pre-processing or employ model architecture modifications prone to error
accumulation. In contrast to existing noise-process paradigms, we propose a
noise-robust adaptation method via asymmetric LoRA poisoning experts (LoPE), a
novel framework that enhances model robustness to noise only with generated
noisy data. Drawing inspiration from the mixture-of-experts architecture, LoPE
strategically integrates a dedicated poisoning expert in an asymmetric LoRA
configuration. Through a two-stage paradigm, LoPE performs noise injection on
the poisoning expert during fine-tuning to enhance its noise discrimination and
processing ability. During inference, we selectively mask the dedicated
poisoning expert to leverage purified knowledge acquired by normal experts for
noise-robust output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoPE achieves
strong performance and robustness purely through the low-cost noise injection,
which completely eliminates the requirement of data cleaning.

Abstract: We present a new adaptation method MaCP, Minimal yet Mighty adaptive Cosine
Projection, that achieves exceptional performance while requiring minimal
parameters and memory for fine-tuning large foundation models. Its general idea
is to exploit the superior energy compaction and decorrelation properties of
cosine projection to improve both model efficiency and accuracy. Specifically,
it projects the weight change from the low-rank adaptation into the discrete
cosine space. Then, the weight change is partitioned over different levels of
the discrete cosine spectrum, and each partition's most critical frequency
components are selected. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MaCP across a wide range of single-modality tasks, including natural language
understanding, natural language generation, text summarization, as well as
multi-modality tasks such as image classification and video understanding. MaCP
consistently delivers superior accuracy, significantly reduced computational
complexity, and lower memory requirements compared to existing alternatives.

Conclusion: ADG通过扩散模型创新性地解决了离线RL中的数据损坏问题，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Real-world datasets collected from sensors or human inputs are prone to noise
and errors, posing significant challenges for applying offline reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing methods have made progress in addressing
corrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption
in high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the
dataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong
denoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their
tendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To
overcome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a
novel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data
corruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable
learning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second,
we use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between
clean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard
DDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously
identified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL
training. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly
integrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks,
including MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively
mitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline
RL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: RelSC作为一个具有挑战性和多样性的基准，有助于推动图回归方法的发展。

Abstract: Graph-level regression underpins many real-world applications, yet public
benchmarks remain heavily skewed toward molecular graphs and citation networks.
This limited diversity hinders progress on models that must generalize across
both homogeneous and heterogeneous graph structures. We introduce RelSC, a new
graph-regression dataset built from program graphs that combine syntactic and
semantic information extracted from source code. Each graph is labelled with
the execution-time cost of the corresponding program, providing a continuous
target variable that differs markedly from those found in existing benchmarks.
RelSC is released in two complementary variants. RelSC-H supplies rich node
features under a single (homogeneous) edge type, while RelSC-M preserves the
original multi-relational structure, connecting nodes through multiple edge
types that encode distinct semantic relationships. Together, these variants let
researchers probe how representation choice influences model behaviour. We
evaluate a diverse set of graph neural network architectures on both variants
of RelSC. The results reveal consistent performance differences between the
homogeneous and multi-relational settings, emphasising the importance of
structural representation. These findings demonstrate RelSC's value as a
challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing graph regression methods.

Motivation: 现有数据混合方法未随训练动态调整且忽略域内交互，导致预训练效率低且性能受限。为降低碳足迹和成本，需开发更高效的数据混合策略。

Method: 采用actor-critic框架设计AC-ODM方法：1) 用辅助网络捕捉动态领域权重 2) 奖励函数考虑域内交互 3) 将小代理模型训练的采样策略直接迁移至大模型。

Result: AC-ODM-410M比ODM快71%达到最优验证困惑度，在MMLU零样本任务上准确率提升27.5%，HumanEval pass@1指标提高2.23倍。

Conclusion: AC-ODM通过动态数据混合和域内交互建模，实现了高效预训练与性能提升的平衡，为LLM训练提供了可迁移的优化方案。

Abstract: The coverage and composition of pretraining data significantly impacts the
generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). To reduce the carbon
footprint and financial costs of training, some data mixing methods, which
applied the optimized domain weights of a small proxy model to train a larger
one, were proposed. However, these methods did not evolute with the training
dynamics. The existing online data mixing (ODM) method addressed this
limitation by applying the multi-armed bandit algorithm as data sampling
strategy. Yet, it did not consider the intra-domain interactions. In this
paper, we develop an actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) method,
which captures the varying domain weights by auxiliary actor-critic networks
and consider the intra-domain interactions with the reward function. While
constructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the
actor, which is trained with a small proxy LLM as the environment, as the
sampling strategy. The transfer of sampling strategy can not only ensure the
efficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of
pretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M,
which invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M
parameters, reaching the optimal validation perplexity of ODM 71% faster, and
improves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy,
about 2.23x better on pass@1 of HumanEval benchmark.

Conclusion: CNN-LSTM混合模型能有效预测COVID-19严重程度，展示了AI在基因组监测和精准公共卫生中的实用性，为未来疫情早期预测提供了框架。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the critical need
for accurate prediction of disease severity to optimize healthcare resource
allocation and patient management. The spike protein, which facilitates viral
entry into host cells, exhibits high mutation rates, particularly in the
receptor-binding domain, influencing viral pathogenicity. Artificial
intelligence approaches, such as deep learning, offer promising solutions for
leveraging genomic and clinical data to predict disease outcomes. Objective:
This study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict
COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical
metadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike
protein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion
criteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154
mild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,
while demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid
CNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern
extraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The
model achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%,
and recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training
stabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting. The most prevalent
lineages (P.1, AY.99.2) and clades (GR, GK) aligned with regional
epidemiological trends, suggesting potential associations between viral
genetics and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model
effectively predicted COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and
clinical data, highlighting the utility of AI in genomic surveillance and
precision public health. Despite limitations, this approach provides a
framework for early severity prediction in future outbreaks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LaCT的大块测试时训练方法，通过使用极大的块更新（2K到1M tokens）来提高硬件利用率和状态容量，适用于多种模态和任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时训练（TTT）方法在处理长上下文数据时效率低下，主要因为它们在现代GPU上的FLOPs利用率极低（通常<5%），且小批量更新不适合处理非1D有序序列的数据。

Method: LaCT采用极大的块更新（2K到1M tokens），显著提高硬件利用率，并支持非线性状态规模的扩展（高达模型参数的40%），同时无需复杂的核实现。

Result: LaCT在多种模态和任务中验证有效，包括图像集的新视角合成、语言模型和自回归视频扩散，最高可扩展到14B参数的自回归视频扩散模型，处理56K tokens的序列。

Conclusion: LaCT方法为长上下文建模和测试时训练领域的研究提供了新的思路和加速，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the
model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast
weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past
tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show
effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on
modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely
low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online
minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,
a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the
data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or
N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the
opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to
1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk
Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of
magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size
(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,
all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It
also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online
updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,
including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and
auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR
video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence
experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We
hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of
long-context modeling and test-time training. Website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练深度生成模型的零样本贝叶斯优化方法，避免了传统方法中的代理模型拟合和采集函数优化，显著提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法需要昂贵的代理模型重新训练和采集函数优化步骤，限制了其效率和可扩展性。

Method: 使用预训练的深度生成模型直接从最优点的后验分布中采样，无需代理模型拟合或采集函数优化。

Result: 在真实基准测试中，相比基于高斯过程的贝叶斯优化，实现了超过35倍的效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效并行和分布式贝叶斯优化提供了新的解决方案，适用于高通量优化任务。

Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box functions is ubiquitous in science
and engineering. A common solution to this problem is Bayesian optimization
(BO), which is generally comprised of two components: (i) a surrogate model and
(ii) an acquisition function, which generally require expensive re-training and
optimization steps at each iteration, respectively. Although recent work
enabled in-context surrogate models that do not require re-training, virtually
all existing BO methods still require acquisition function maximization to
select the next observation, which introduces many knobs to tune, such as Monte
Carlo samplers and multi-start optimizers. In this work, we propose a
completely in-context, zero-shot solution for BO that does not require
surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. This is done by using a
pre-trained deep generative model to directly sample from the posterior over
the optimum point. We show that this process is equivalent to Thompson sampling
and demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our foundation model
on a suite of real-world benchmarks. We achieve an efficiency gain of more than
35x in terms of wall-clock time when compared with Gaussian process-based BO,
enabling efficient parallel and distributed BO, e.g., for high-throughput
optimization.

Motivation: 研究RLHF算法的统计效率，尤其是在在线学习过程中如何有效利用人类偏好数据来优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的行为。

Method: 设计了一种基于Thompson采样的模型无关后验采样算法，并采用Bellman eluder（BE）维度作为函数类的复杂度度量。

Result: 算法实现了O(√T)的遗憾界，并基于最大似然估计（MLE）的泛化边界建立了平方Bellman误差的集中不等式。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论上具有高效性，其分析方法和结果可能对其他相关研究具有独立意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has achieved great
empirical success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preference, and it is of great importance to study the statistical efficiency
of RLHF algorithms from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we consider
the online RLHF setting where the preference data is revealed during the
learning process and study action value function approximation. We design a
model-free posterior sampling algorithm for online RLHF inspired by Thompson
sampling and provide its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we adopt Bellman
eluder (BE) dimension as the complexity measure of the function class and
establish $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the proposed algorithm with other
multiplicative factor depending on the horizon, BE dimension and the
$log$-bracketing number of the function class. Further, in the analysis, we
first establish the concentration-type inequality of the squared Bellman error
bound based on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) generalization bound,
which plays the crucial rules in obtaining the eluder-type regret bound and may
be of independent interest.

TL;DR: 论文提出BIRD框架，通过匹配师生模型的内部表示结构来迁移对齐行为，显著提升模型鲁棒性，并揭示教师模型表示特性的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在迁移对齐行为（如鲁棒性、公平性）时面临遗忘和成本高昂的问题，需一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: BIRD框架通过表示结构蒸馏（匹配师生模型的内部表示结构）实现行为迁移，无需任务特定数据。

Result: BIRD在图像分类任务中比基线方法提升16%的鲁棒准确率，且教师模型规模可远小于学生模型。教师表示的三类特性可解释85%的迁移效果差异。

Conclusion: BIRD将小型对齐模型转化为可扩展的种子，解决了安全AI系统部署的关键瓶颈，并为教师模型选择提供实践指导。

Abstract: Human-aligned deep learning models exhibit behaviors consistent with human
values, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty. Transferring these
behavioral properties to models trained on different tasks or data
distributions remains challenging: aligned behavior is easily forgotten during
fine-tuning, and collecting task-specific data that preserves this behavior can
be prohibitively costly. We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via
Representation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring
aligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student
model to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image
classification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual
learning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next
strongest baseline. It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a
much simpler dataset and is $25 \times$ smaller than the student. In a
large-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three
interpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e.,
task relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up
to 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical
guidance for teacher selection and design. BIRD turns small, well-aligned
models into scalable alignment seeds, removing a key bottleneck in deploying
safe AI systems in the wild.

Abstract: This paper presents an automatic method for the design of Neural Networks

privacy-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The proposed method
runs on IoT gateways and designs NNs for connected sensor nodes without sharing
the collected data outside the local network, keeping the data in the site of
collection. This approach has the potential to enable ML for Healthcare
Internet of Things (HIoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), designing
hardware-friendly and custom NNs at the edge for personalized healthcare and
advanced industrial services such as quality control, predictive maintenance,
or fault diagnosis. By preventing data from being disclosed to cloud services,
this method safeguards sensitive information, including industrial secrets and
personal data. The outcomes of a thorough experimental session confirm that --
on the Visual Wake Words dataset -- the proposed approach can achieve
state-of-the-art results by exploiting a search procedure that runs in less
than 10 hours on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理计数和识别等客观视觉任务时，受先验知识影响产生显著偏差，准确率仅为17.05%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）的先验知识如何影响视觉语言模型（VLMs）在标准视觉任务中的准确性，特别是当这些知识导致错误或偏见时。

Method: 通过测试VLMs在7个不同领域（如动物、商标、棋盘游戏等）的计数和识别任务，评估其准确性，并分析插入描述性文本对结果的影响。

Result: VLMs在计数任务中平均准确率仅为17.05%，且插入相关文本进一步降低了准确性。即使指示模型复查或仅依赖图像细节，准确率提升也有限（平均+2分）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在处理视觉任务时存在的偏见问题，并提出了一个自动化框架来测试这些偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from
the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway
their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the
knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models
(VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a
fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of
17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo)
across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical
illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the
subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The
biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their
results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting
accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting
failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code

Motivation: 现有激活函数如Swish和GELU在不同领域表现优异，但存在领域特异性优化问题，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出SG-Blend，通过可学习参数动态结合SSwish（对称Swish变体）和GELU，以平衡模型表达能力和梯度稳定性。

Result: 在多种自然语言和计算机视觉任务中，SG-Blend表现优于现有基线，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: SG-Blend作为一种通用激活函数，具有广泛适用性和高性能潜力，可作为现有激活函数的替代方案。

Abstract: The design of activation functions remains a pivotal component in optimizing
deep neural networks. While prevailing choices like Swish and GELU demonstrate
considerable efficacy, they often exhibit domain-specific optima. This work
introduces SG-Blend, a novel activation function that blends our proposed
SSwish, a first-order symmetric variant of Swish and the established GELU
through dynamic interpolation. By adaptively blending these constituent
functions via learnable parameters, SG-Blend aims to harness their
complementary strengths: SSwish's controlled non-monotonicity and symmetry, and
GELU's smooth, probabilistic profile, to achieve a more universally robust
balance between model expressivity and gradient stability. We conduct
comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse modalities and
architectures, showing performance improvements across all considered natural
language and computer vision tasks and models. These results, achieved with
negligible computational overhead, underscore SG-Blend's potential as a
versatile, drop-in replacement that consistently outperforms strong
contemporary baselines. The code is available at

Conclusion: 论文认为PFNs和其他摊销推断方法是贝叶斯推断的未来方向，值得进一步研究以解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Training neural networks on randomly generated artificial datasets yields
Bayesian models that capture the prior defined by the dataset-generating
distribution. Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) are a class of methods designed
to leverage this insight. In an era of rapidly increasing computational
resources for pre-training and a near stagnation in the generation of new
real-world data in many applications, PFNs are poised to play a more important
role across a wide range of applications. They enable the efficient allocation
of pre-training compute to low-data scenarios. Originally applied to small
Bayesian modeling tasks, the field of PFNs has significantly expanded to
address more complex domains and larger datasets. This position paper argues
that PFNs and other amortized inference approaches represent the future of
Bayesian inference, leveraging amortized learning to tackle data-scarce
problems. We thus believe they are a fruitful area of research. In this
position paper, we explore their potential and directions to address their
current limitations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种高效的转置N:M稀疏掩码求解器，解决了现有方法在大模型上的扩展性问题，并实现了GPU加速，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: N:M稀疏性虽然能有效压缩模型并加速前向计算，但其在矩阵转置时无法保持稀疏模式，限制了训练效率。现有方法难以扩展到大型模型或仅限于M=4，导致压缩与精度的权衡不理想。

Method: 通过将掩码生成建模为最优传输问题，结合熵正则化和Dykstra算法求解，并采用舍入过程。基于GPU的张量实现充分利用并行性，显著提升速度。

Result: 该方法在LLaMA3.2-8B模型上实现了16:32转置稀疏性，性能接近标准N:M稀疏模型，且优于标准2:4稀疏模型，GPU加速可达100倍。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效且可扩展的转置N:M稀疏掩码生成方法，适用于大型模型，并可与现有层间剪枝框架集成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Network pruning reduces the computational requirements of large neural
networks, with N:M sparsity -- retaining only N out of every M consecutive
weights -- offering a compelling balance between compressed model quality and
hardware acceleration. However, N:M sparsity only accelerates forward-pass
computations, as N:M patterns are not preserved during matrix transposition,
limiting efficiency during training where both passes are computationally
intensive. While transposable N:M sparsity has been proposed to address this
limitation, existing methods for finding transposable N:M sparse masks either
fail to scale to large models or are restricted to M=4 which results in
suboptimal compression-accuracy trade-off. We introduce an efficient solver for
transposable N:M masks that scales to billion-parameter models. We formulate
mask generation as optimal transport problems and solve through entropy
regularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Our
tensor-based implementation exploits GPU parallelism, achieving up to 100x
speedup with only 1-10% error compared to existing methods. Our approach can be
integrated with layer-wise N:M pruning frameworks including Wanda, SparseGPT
and ALPS to produce transposable N:M sparse models with arbitrary N:M values.
Experiments show that LLaMA3.2-8B with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintains
performance close to its standard N:M counterpart and outperforms standard 2:4
sparse model, showing the practical value of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习模型用于资源分配的背景下，受影响的代理可能有动机通过策略性改变特征来获取更好的结果。现有研究难以区分虚假报告与真实修改，因此需要一种新方法来识别和量化虚假报告行为。

Method: 论文提出了一种因果驱动的方法，通过比较虚假报告特征对下游变量的因果效应差异，区分虚假报告与真实修改。该方法利用操纵与非操纵数据集中的因果效应不对称性。

Result: 论文证明了虚假报告率的可识别性，并描述了估计量的方差。通过半合成和真实医疗保险数据集的实证验证，表明该方法能有效识别现实场景中的虚假报告行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为识别和量化虚假报告行为提供了有效工具，适用于现实世界中的资源分配场景，有助于提高决策的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: In settings where ML models are used to inform the allocation of resources,
agents affected by the allocation decisions might have an incentive to
strategically change their features to secure better outcomes. While prior work
has studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from
genuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose
a causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent
misreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features
from genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine
modification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables
(i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal
effect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from
manipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally
prove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of
our estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a
semi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating
that our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still
lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational
spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are
structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of
structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for
identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages
them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information,
what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions
condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural
primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic
quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and
generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models,
sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language
Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the
entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models
ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models
of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems
and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the
constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of
structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

d'Orsi, Gupta, Lee, and Panigrahi (NeurIPS 2024). We consider an edge-based
version of this model, where each edge provides two bits of information,
corresponding to predictions about whether each of its endpoints belong to an
optimal solution. Even with weak predictions where each bit is only
$\varepsilon$-correlated with the true solution, this information allows us to
break approximation barriers in the standard setting. We develop algorithms
with improved approximation ratios for MaxCut, Vertex Cover, Set Cover, and
Maximum Independent Set problems (among others). Across these problems, our
algorithms share a unifying theme, where we separately satisfy constraints
related to high degree vertices (using predictions) and low-degree vertices
(without using predictions) and carefully combine the answers.

### [226] [Critical Batch Size Revisited: A Simple Empirical Approach to Large-Batch Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23971)
*William Merrill,Shane Arora,Dirk Groeneveld,Hannaneh Hajishirzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种直接测量临界批次大小(CBS)的简单方法，并展示了CBS在训练过程中的变化趋势，通过批次大小预热策略有效提升大批次训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度噪声尺度估计临界批次大小(CBS)的方法存在强假设限制，实际应用可靠性存疑。需要更直接的方法来指导大规模语言模型训练中的批次选择。

Method: 提出直接测量临界批次大小的实证方法，跟踪其训练动态变化，并设计批次大小预热策略（从小批次开始，随CBS增长逐步扩大）。

Result: 发现CBS在初始化时为0，初期快速增长后趋于平稳；该规律在不同规模模型(1B/7B)中均成立；应用预热策略训练OLMo 1B模型，用57%梯度步数达到更优效果。

Conclusion: 直接测量CBS的方法可靠，批次预热策略能有效平衡训练速度与效率，为大规模语言模型训练提供了可扩展的数据并行方案。

Abstract: The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a
large batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too
large will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.
(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not
substantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale
during training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when
training GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a
proxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be
trusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a
simple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS
evolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that
CBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus
as training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across
different model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can
inform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over
training motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language
models at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the
CBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to
slightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient
steps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language
models at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADEL-FL提出了一种联合优化每轮截止时间和用户特定批量大小的联邦学习框架，以解决设备异构性导致的延迟问题，并在异构条件下表现出优越的收敛速度和最终准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步联邦学习（FL）由于设备异构性导致较慢的客户端（拖后腿者）延迟或降低全局更新，现有解决方案如固定截止时间、客户端选择和分层部分聚合等，将轮次时间和本地工作负载视为静态参数，限制了其在严格时间约束下的有效性。

Method: ADEL-FL框架通过联合优化每轮截止时间和用户特定批量大小进行分层聚合，将问题表述为一个约束优化问题，最小化在总训练时间和全局轮次下与全局最优解的预期L2距离。

Result: 实验表明，ADEL-FL在异构条件下在收敛速度和最终准确率方面均优于其他方法，并且能够产生具有有限方差的无偏更新。

Conclusion: ADEL-FL通过动态调整轮次截止时间和批量大小，有效解决了联邦学习中的设备异构性问题，提升了模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed edge devices while preserving data privacy, and typically operates
in a round-based synchronous manner. However, synchronous FL suffers from
latency bottlenecks due to device heterogeneity, where slower clients
(stragglers) delay or degrade global updates. Prior solutions, such as fixed
deadlines, client selection, and layer-wise partial aggregation, alleviate the
effect of stragglers, but treat round timing and local workload as static
parameters, limiting their effectiveness under strict time constraints. We
propose ADEL-FL, a novel framework that jointly optimizes per-round deadlines
and user-specific batch sizes for layer-wise aggregation. Our approach
formulates a constrained optimization problem minimizing the expected L2
distance to the global optimum under total training time and global rounds. We
provide a convergence analysis under exponential compute models and prove that
ADEL-FL yields unbiased updates with bounded variance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ADEL-FL outperforms alternative methods in both convergence
rate and final accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.

Motivation: 现有计算方法和大语言模型难以满足药物设计中多属性分子优化的需求，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用C-MuMOInstruct数据集进行指令微调，开发了GeLLMO-Cs系列模型，专注于属性特定的优化任务。

Result: GeLLMO-Cs在5个分布内和5个分布外任务中表现优异，成功率提升最高达126%，并展现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeLLMO-Cs为支持具有属性特定目标的现实多样化优化提供了基础，推动了药物设计领域的发展。

Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively
improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels,
while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing
computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such
nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability.
To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning
dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific
objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of
instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific
optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5
out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong
baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit
impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen
instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support
realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于分解的多模态视图框架DMMV，用于长期时间序列预测，通过趋势-季节性分解和残差自适应分解整合多模态视图，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列通常以数值序列表示，但转化为图像和文本后能提供多模态视图，揭示互补模式并利用预训练大模型（如视觉大模型）进行长期预测。然而，直接应用视觉大模型会引入对“预测周期”的归纳偏差。

Method: 提出DMMV框架，结合趋势-季节性分解和基于反向残差的自适应分解，整合多模态视图以优化长期时间序列预测。

Result: 在8个基准数据集中的6个上，DMMV均方误差表现最佳，优于14种现有先进模型及单模态基线。

Conclusion: DMMV通过分解策略有效利用多模态数据，显著提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be
transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the
same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable
the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models
(LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified
in this work, applying LVMs to LTSF poses an inductive bias towards
"forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel
decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal
decomposition and a novel backcast residual based adaptive decomposition to
integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view
and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE)
on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管方法学取得重大进展，超参数调优仍是机器学习系统开发中关键且昂贵的一环。论文旨在探索无需调优的神经网络训练算法的可能性。

Method: 通过冻结非学习率超参数为默认值，并使用AlgoPerf基准测试无学习率方法的性能，同时搜索跨任务表现良好的配置。

Result: 文献提供的默认设置表现不佳，但校准后的无学习率方法性能显著提升，仍略逊于NadamW基线。

Conclusion: 无学习率方法仍有改进空间，需通过强基准测试推动超参数简化技术的发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in methodology, hyperparameter tuning remains a
crucial (and expensive) part of the development of machine learning systems.
Even ignoring architectural choices, deep neural networks have a large number
of optimization and regularization hyperparameters that need to be tuned
carefully per workload in order to obtain the best results. In a perfect world,
training algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning,
but would instead have default settings that performed well across many
workloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization
methods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters -- particularly
the learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how
far away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely
obviate the need for painful tuning?
  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as
components of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate)
hyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the
recently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that
literature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we
performed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across
all workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free
methods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a
similarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score. Our results
suggest that there is still much room for improvement for learning-rate-free
methods, and that testing against a strong, workload-agnostic baseline is
important to improve hyperparameter reduction techniques.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Adam优化算法与梯度下降（GD）在训练两层ReLU神经网络时的隐式偏差差异，发现Adam能抵抗简单性偏差，产生更丰富的特征和非线性决策边界，从而在测试精度和分布变化下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Adam是深度学习中广泛使用的优化算法，但其隐式偏差及其与梯度下降（GD）等一阶方法的差异尚不明确。GD已知会表现出简单性偏差，而Adam对此的抵抗性及其影响值得深入研究。

Method: 论文通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了Adam和GD在二元分类任务中的表现，使用了合成高斯聚类数据，并分析了种群梯度。

Result: 研究发现GD倾向于产生线性决策边界和次优边距，而Adam能生成更丰富的特征和非线性边界，接近贝叶斯最优预测器，并在分布变化下表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Adam优化算法因其抵抗简单性偏差的能力，在复杂任务和分布变化下表现优于GD，提供了更高的测试精度和更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning
applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from
other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as
(stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural
networks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to
find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such
simplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate
the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer
ReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data
with Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting
in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to
much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is
closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also
allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under
certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing
the population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present
empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior
generalization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks
trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well
under certain distributional shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer和大语言模型（LLMs）在时间序列分析中的应用受到关注，研究者开始探索大型视觉模型（LVMs）在多模态时间序列分析中的潜力。本文旨在回答LVMs是否真正适用于时间序列分析。

Method: 研究设计了首个系统性实验，涵盖4种LVMs、8种成像方法、18个数据集和26个基线模型，覆盖高层（分类）和低层（预测）任务，并进行了广泛的消融分析。

Result: 研究发现LVMs在时间序列分类任务中有效，但在预测任务中表现受限。当前最佳的LVM预测器仅适用于特定类型的LVMs和成像方法，且存在预测周期偏差和长回溯窗口利用不足的问题。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果为未来基于LVM和多模态的时间序列分析解决方案奠定了基础，并指出了LVMs在预测任务中的改进方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series
research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation
models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality,
Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past,
the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When
it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time
series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled
study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across
both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with
extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for
time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although
effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types
of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and
have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings
could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based
solutions to different time series tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the most effective post-training
approach for improving the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
practice, because of the high demands on latency and memory, it is particularly
challenging to develop an efficient RL framework that reliably manages policy
models with hundreds to thousands of billions of parameters.
  In this paper, we present LlamaRL, a fully distributed, asynchronous RL
framework optimized for efficient training of large-scale LLMs with various
model sizes (8B, 70B, and 405B parameters) on GPU clusters ranging from a
handful to thousands of devices. LlamaRL introduces a streamlined,
single-controller architecture built entirely on native PyTorch, enabling
modularity, ease of use, and seamless scalability to thousands of GPUs. We also
provide a theoretical analysis of LlamaRL's efficiency, including a formal
proof that its asynchronous design leads to strict RL speed-up. Empirically, by
leveraging best practices such as colocated model offloading, asynchronous
off-policy training, and distributed direct memory access for weight
synchronization, LlamaRL achieves significant efficiency gains -- up to 10.7x
speed-up compared to DeepSpeed-Chat-like systems on a 405B-parameter policy
model. Furthermore, the efficiency advantage continues to grow with increasing
model scale, demonstrating the framework's suitability for future large-scale
RL training.

Result: 实验表明该方法能显著自引导缓解不同架构和数据模态中的伪偏差。

Conclusion: NeuronTune为提升模型鲁棒性提供了一种无需标注的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often develop spurious bias, reliance on correlations
between non-essential features and classes for predictions. For example, a
model may identify objects based on frequently co-occurring backgrounds rather
than intrinsic features, resulting in degraded performance on data lacking
these correlations. Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external
annotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are
not relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step
towards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post
hoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our
method probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate
neurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify
our approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one.
Unlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious
correlation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving
model robustness. Experiments across different architectures and data
modalities demonstrate that our method significantly mitigates spurious bias in
a self-guided way.

Motivation: 标准自注意力对所有查询-键交互一视同仁，导致Transformer容易受到噪声输入的影响。受生物神经回路中的侧抑制机制启发，本文旨在设计一种能动态抑制噪声的自注意力机制。

Method: 提出多头差分门控自注意力（M-DGSA），每个注意力头分为兴奋和抑制分支，通过双软最大映射和由词嵌入预测的Sigmoid门融合，实现上下文感知的对比增强。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，M-DGSA相比普通Transformer、Vision Transformer和差分Transformer基线表现出更优的噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: M-DGSA通过生物启发的门控机制有效提升了Transformer的噪声鲁棒性，且能无缝集成到现有架构中，具有跨领域适用性。

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to
corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key
interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural
circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use
of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose
Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head
input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head
splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are
fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a
context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing
Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both
vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over
vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer
baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism
for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis
of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii)
comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain
applicability.

Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在节点分类任务中表现出色，但其成功依赖于大量标记数据。然而，获取高质量标记数据成本高昂，尤其是在新兴领域。现有的无监督域适应（UDA）技术未充分考虑图结构和消息传递机制，且在标签分布偏移时效果不佳。

Conclusion: 该框架通过链接预测和身份保持学习，显著提升了图神经网络在无监督域适应任务中的表现，尤其在处理标签分布偏移时具有优势。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification
on graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while
obtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly
emerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a
classifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target
graph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been
proposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target
graphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply
adopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically
distributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do
not fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs
during the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among
domains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link
prediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can
facilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the
target nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain.
This strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its
deviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to
disproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of
discriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel
identity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge
insertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework.

Motivation: 以往多模态学习研究依赖多说话者数据，但个体差异限制了声学与发音关系的精细建模。本研究旨在利用单说话者数据克服这一局限。

Method: 使用单说话者长时MRI语料库，构建了单模态（音频/视频）和多模态的语音识别模型，重点分析各模态的贡献。

Result: 音频与多模态模型在发音方式类别上表现相近，但在发音部位识别上差异显著；潜在空间分析显示语音编码相似，注意力权重揭示特定音素的时序差异。

Conclusion: 单说话者数据能有效建模声学-发音关系，多模态模型通过注意力机制捕捉发音时序特征，为语音产生机制研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Although many previous studies have carried out multimodal learning with
real-time MRI data that captures the audio-visual kinematics of the vocal tract
during speech, these studies have been limited by their reliance on
multi-speaker corpora. This prevents such models from learning a detailed
relationship between acoustics and articulation due to considerable
cross-speaker variability. In this study, we develop unimodal audio and video
models as well as multimodal models for phoneme recognition using a long-form
single-speaker MRI corpus, with the goal of disentangling and interpreting the
contributions of each modality. Audio and multimodal models show similar
performance on different phonetic manner classes but diverge on places of
articulation. Interpretation of the models' latent space shows similar encoding
of the phonetic space across audio and multimodal models, while the models'
attention weights highlight differences in acoustic and articulatory timing for
certain phonemes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are renowned for their ability to generalise well across
diverse tasks, even when heavily overparameterized. Existing works offer only
partial explanations (for example, the NTK-based task-model alignment
explanation neglects feature learning). Here, we provide an end-to-end,
analytically tractable case study that links a network's inductive prior, its
training dynamics including feature learning, and its eventual generalisation.
Specifically, we exploit the one-to-one correspondence between depth-2 discrete
fully connected networks and disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas by training
on Boolean functions. Under a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, our model
exhibits predictable training dynamics and the emergence of interpretable
features. This framework allows us to trace, in detail, how inductive bias and
feature formation drive generalisation.

Conclusion: 梯度指标比激活统计更适合衡量神经元学习能力，GraMa及ReGraMa具有架构无关的通用性优势。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal
activity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn
continually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the
tau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the
expressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents,
this approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address
this, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning
capacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than
preserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the
statistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa
(Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight,
architecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We
show that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse
architectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with
varied activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa
(ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL
algorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.

Motivation: 现有神经算法推理研究主要集中于多项式时间可解问题的精确算法学习，如何将其扩展至更复杂问题仍具挑战性。本文旨在通过原始-对偶范式解决这一难题。

Method: 利用原始变量与对偶变量的二分图表示建立原始-对偶算法与图神经网络的关联，并融合小规模实例的最优解提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) trains neural networks to simulate
classical algorithms, enabling structured and interpretable reasoning over
complex data. While prior research has predominantly focused on learning exact
algorithms for polynomial-time-solvable problems, extending NAR to harder
problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce a general NAR
framework grounded in the primal-dual paradigm, a classical method for
designing efficient approximation algorithms. By leveraging a bipartite
representation between primal and dual variables, we establish an alignment
between primal-dual algorithms and Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, we
incorporate optimal solutions from small instances to greatly enhance the
model's reasoning capabilities. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
model not only simulates but also outperforms approximation algorithms for
multiple tasks, exhibiting robust generalization to larger and
out-of-distribution graphs. Moreover, we highlight the framework's practical
utility by integrating it with commercial solvers and applying it to real-world
datasets.

*Yu He,Yingxi Li,Colin White,Ellen Vitercik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了DSR-Bench基准测试，评估大语言模型在数据结构上的结构推理能力，发现现有模型在多属性和多跳推理上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次的应用驱动评估，而忽略了结构推理这一基础能力。为了填补这一空白，作者提出了DSR-Bench，专注于评估大语言模型在数据结构上的推理能力。

Method: 作者设计了DSR-Bench，包含20种数据结构、35种操作和4140个问题实例，采用分层组织进行细粒度分析。评估流程完全自动化且确定性，避免主观判断。

Result: 实验显示，指令调优模型在基础多属性和多跳推理上表现不佳。推理导向模型表现较好，但在复杂和混合结构上仍显脆弱，最佳模型在挑战子集上平均得分仅为47%。模型在多维数据和自然语言任务描述上表现较差。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在结构推理能力上存在明显不足，尤其是在多维数据和自然语言任务描述方面，这对实际应用部署提出了严峻挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for real-world tasks
that fundamentally involve data manipulation. A core requirement across these
tasks is the ability to perform structural reasoning--that is, to understand
and reason about data relationships. For example, customer requests require a
temporal ordering, which can be represented by data structures such as queues.
However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on high-level, application-driven
evaluations without isolating this fundamental capability. To address this gap,
we introduce DSR-Bench, a novel benchmark evaluating LLMs' structural reasoning
capabilities through data structures, which provide interpretable
representations of data relationships. DSR-Bench includes 20 data structures,
35 operations, and 4,140 problem instances, organized hierarchically for
fine-grained analysis of reasoning limitations. Our evaluation pipeline is
fully automated and deterministic, eliminating subjective human or model-based
judgments. Its synthetic nature also ensures scalability and minimizes data
contamination risks. We benchmark nine state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis
shows that instruction-tuned models struggle with basic multi-attribute and
multi-hop reasoning. Furthermore, while reasoning-oriented models perform
better, they remain fragile on complex and hybrid structures, with the best
model achieving an average score of only 47% on the challenge subset.
Crucially, models often perform poorly on multi-dimensional data and natural
language task descriptions, highlighting a critical gap for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia associated with
elevated health risks, where timely detection is pivotal for mitigating
stroke-related morbidity. This study introduces an innovative hybrid
methodology integrating unsupervised deep learning and gradient boosting models
to improve AF detection. A 19-layer deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is
coupled with three boosting classifiers-AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM
(LGBM)-to harness their complementary advantages while addressing individual
limitations. The proposed framework uniquely combines DCAE with gradient
boosting, enabling end-to-end AF identification devoid of manual feature
extraction. The DCAE-LGBM model attains an F1-score of 95.20%, sensitivity of
99.99%, and inference latency of four seconds, outperforming existing methods
and aligning with clinical deployment requirements. The DCAE integration
significantly enhances boosting models, positioning this hybrid system as a
reliable tool for automated AF detection in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调视觉基础模型时，常导致其他任务的概念遗忘。现有方法通过权重或特征点匹配保留知识，但忽略了特征邻域结构中的丰富知识。

Method: 提出Proxy-FDA方法，利用最近邻图在预训练和微调特征空间间进行特征分布对齐，并通过动态生成代理增强数据多样性。

Result: 实验表明Proxy-FDA显著减少微调时的概念遗忘，且遗忘与分布距离度量强相关。方法在多种微调设置和任务中均有效。

Conclusion: Proxy-FDA通过特征结构知识保留和代理增强，有效解决了微调时的概念遗忘问题，适用于多种任务和设置。

Abstract: Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich
representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream
tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often
leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of
robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without
affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching
the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such
point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the
feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose
a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the
structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution
Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and
fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative
proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments
show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during
fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a
distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further
demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end,
few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image
classification, captioning and VQA.

Result: G-BASE在节点级成员推理攻击中表现优于现有方法，BASE在非图数据上的性能匹配或超越现有最优方法（如LiRA和RMIA），且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 论文证明了BASE和RMIA在特定超参数设置下的等价性，为RMIA攻击提供了贝叶斯最优的理论依据。

Abstract: We develop practical and theoretically grounded membership inference attacks
(MIAs) against both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and
graph-structured data. Building on the Bayesian decision-theoretic framework of
Sablayrolles et al., we derive the Bayes-optimal membership inference rule for
node-level MIAs against graph neural networks, addressing key open questions
about optimal query strategies in the graph setting. We introduce BASE and
G-BASE, computationally efficient approximations of the Bayes-optimal attack.
G-BASE achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed
classifier-based node-level MIA attacks. BASE, which is also applicable to
non-graph data, matches or exceeds the performance of prior state-of-the-art
MIAs, such as LiRA and RMIA, at a significantly lower computational cost.
Finally, we show that BASE and RMIA are equivalent under a specific
hyperparameter setting, providing a principled, Bayes-optimal justification for
the RMIA attack.

TL;DR: 该研究通过改进预测因子和开发可解释的多层堆叠集成模型，提高了急性脑卒中患者住院时间（LOS）预测的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在预测急性脑卒中患者住院时间方面表现不佳，泛化能力有限，且忽视了系统级因素。本研究旨在通过优化预测因子和开发可解释的集成模型来提升预测性能。

Method: 研究使用澳大利亚卒中基金会急性审计数据（2015-2021），分别针对缺血性和出血性脑卒中开发模型。通过基于相关性的特征选择方法筛选关键预测因子，并评估模型的区分度（AUC）、校准曲线和可解释性（SHAP图）。

Result: 集成模型在缺血性脑卒中（N=12,575）中表现优异（AUC: 0.824），显著优于逻辑回归（AUC: 0.805; P=0.0004），但在出血性脑卒中（N=1,970）中未显著优于逻辑回归（AUC: 0.843 vs 0.828; P=0.136）。SHAP分析发现两类脑卒中的共同预测因子。

Conclusion: 可解释的集成模型能有效预测缺血性脑卒中的长期住院时间，但出血性脑卒中需更大样本验证。

Abstract: Length of stay (LOS) prediction in acute stroke is critical for improving
care planning. Existing machine learning models have shown suboptimal
predictive performance, limited generalisability, and have overlooked
system-level factors. We aimed to enhance model efficiency, performance, and
interpretability by refining predictors and developing an interpretable
multi-level stacking ensemble model. Data were accessed from the biennial
Stroke Foundation Acute Audit (2015, 2017, 2019, 2021) in Australia. Models
were developed for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke separately. The outcome
was prolonged LOS (the LOS above the 75th percentile). Candidate predictors
(ischaemic: n=89; haemorrhagic: n=83) were categorised into patient, clinical,
and system domains. Feature selection with correlation-based approaches was
used to refine key predictors. The evaluation of models included discrimination
(AUC), calibration curves, and interpretability (SHAP plots). In ischaemic
stroke (N=12,575), prolonged LOS was >=9 days, compared to >=11 days in
haemorrhagic stroke (N=1,970). The ensemble model achieved superior performance
[AUC: 0.824 (95% CI: 0.801-0.846)] and statistically outperformed logistic
regression [AUC: 0.805 (95% CI: 0.782-0.829); P=0.0004] for ischaemic. However,
the model [AUC: 0.843 (95% CI: 0.790-0.895)] did not statistically outperform
logistic regression [AUC: 0.828 (95% CI: 0.774-0.882); P=0.136] for
haemorrhagic. SHAP analysis identified shared predictors for both types of
stroke: rehabilitation assessment, urinary incontinence, stroke unit care,
inability to walk independently, physiotherapy, and stroke care coordinators
involvement. An explainable ensemble model effectively predicted the prolonged
LOS in ischaemic stroke. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed for
haemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusion: 该工作首次实现标准神经网络对NFA的完全符号化模拟，通过ReLU动力学统一了自动机理论与神经计算。

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive framework establishing the equivalence
between nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) and standard feedforward ReLU
neural networks. By encoding automaton states as binary vectors and transitions
as sparse linear layers, we show that ReLU activations simulate
nondeterministic branching, subset construction, and $\epsilon$-closures in a
mathematically precise manner. Our core theoretical results prove that a
three-layer ReLU network of width $\mathcal{O}(n)$ can exactly recognize any
regular language accepted by an $n$-state NFA-without recurrence, memory, or
approximation. Furthermore, we show that gradient descent over
structure-preserving networks preserves symbolic semantics and acceptance
behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple validation tasks-including
parallel path tracking, symbolic subset construction, $\epsilon$-closure
convergence, acceptance classification, structural training invariants, and
functional equivalence-achieve perfect or near-perfect empirical alignment with
ground-truth automata. This work provides the first provably complete symbolic
simulation of NFAs within standard deep learning architectures, uniting
automata theory with neural computation through ReLU dynamics.

Abstract: Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuits play a critical role in the integrated
circuit (IC) industry. However, automating Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) circuit
design has remained a longstanding challenge due to its difficulty and
complexity. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer
promising potential for supporting AMS circuit analysis and design. However,
current research typically evaluates MLLMs on isolated tasks within the domain,
lacking a comprehensive benchmark that systematically assesses model
capabilities across diverse AMS-related challenges. To address this gap, we
introduce AMSbench, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate MLLM performance
across critical tasks including circuit schematic perception, circuit analysis,
and circuit design. AMSbench comprises approximately 8000 test questions
spanning multiple difficulty levels and assesses eight prominent models,
encompassing both open-source and proprietary solutions such as Qwen 2.5-VL and
Gemini 2.5 Pro. Our evaluation highlights significant limitations in current
MLLMs, particularly in complex multi-modal reasoning and sophisticated circuit
design tasks. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs'
understanding and effective application of circuit-specific knowledge, thereby
narrowing the existing performance gap relative to human expertise and moving
toward fully automated AMS circuit design workflows. Our data is released at

Abstract: Building on recent advances in scientific machine learning and generative
modeling for computational fluid dynamics, we propose a conditional score-based
diffusion model designed for multi-scenarios fluid flow prediction. Our model
integrates an energy constraint rooted in the statistical properties of
turbulent flows, improving prediction quality with minimal training, while
enabling efficient sampling at low cost. The method features a simple and
general architecture that requires no problem-specific design, supports
plug-and-play enhancements, and enables fast and flexible solution generation.
It also demonstrates an efficient conditioning mechanism that simplifies
training across different scenarios without demanding a redesign of existing
models. We further explore various stochastic differential equation
formulations to demonstrate how thoughtful design choices enhance performance.
We validate the proposed methodology through extensive experiments on complex
fluid dynamics datasets encompassing a variety of flow regimes and
configurations. Results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves
stable, robust, and physically faithful predictions, even under challenging
turbulent conditions. With properly tuned parameters, it achieves accurate
results across multiple scenarios while preserving key physical and statistical
properties. We present a comprehensive analysis of stochastic differential
equation impact and discuss our approach across diverse fluid mechanics tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中部署的机器学习模型需要适应数据分布随时间变化的概念漂移问题，同时还需在严格的资源约束下保持性能。现有方法通常计算开销大，且无法提供资源使用或理论性能的严格保证。

Method: RCCDA策略利用过去的损失信息和可调的漂移阈值，通过Lyapunov漂移加惩罚框架，开发了一种轻量级的策略，可证明限制更新频率和成本。

Result: 在三个领域泛化数据集上的实验结果表明，该策略在多种概念漂移调度下，优于基线方法，同时严格遵守资源约束。

Conclusion: RCCDA策略特别适合实时机器学习部署，能够在资源受限环境下有效适应概念漂移，同时保证性能。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms deployed in real-world environments are
often faced with the challenge of adapting models to concept drift, where the
task data distributions are shifting over time. The problem becomes even more
difficult when model performance must be maintained under adherence to strict
resource constraints. Existing solutions often depend on drift-detection
methods that produce high computational overhead for resource-constrained
environments, and fail to provide strict guarantees on resource usage or
theoretical performance assurances. To address these shortcomings, we propose
RCCDA: a dynamic model update policy that optimizes ML training dynamics while
ensuring strict compliance to predefined resource constraints, utilizing only
past loss information and a tunable drift threshold. In developing our policy,
we analytically characterize the evolution of model loss under concept drift
with arbitrary training update decisions. Integrating these results into a
Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty framework produces a lightweight policy based on a
measurable accumulated loss threshold that provably limits update frequency and
cost. Experimental results on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate
that our policy outperforms baseline methods in inference accuracy while
adhering to strict resource constraints under several schedules of concept
drift, making our solution uniquely suited for real-time ML deployments.

Result: 在多个基因表达数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统方法显著提高了预测准确性和生物可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了统计严谨性与生物通路知识，为高维基因组数据中的基因选择提供了更稳定且生物学相关的解决方案。

Abstract: Gene selection in high-dimensional genomic data is essential for
understanding disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic outcomes.
Traditional feature selection methods effectively identify predictive genes but
often ignore complex biological pathways and regulatory networks, leading to
unstable and biologically irrelevant signatures. Prior approaches, such as
Lasso-based methods and statistical filtering, either focus solely on
individual gene-outcome associations or fail to capture pathway-level
interactions, presenting a key challenge: how to integrate biological pathway
knowledge while maintaining statistical rigor in gene selection? To address
this gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical
selection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy
that leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information
for initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model
genes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes
both predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates
pathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a
reward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and
pathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and
a centralized critic component. Extensive experiments on multiple gene
expression datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both
prediction accuracy and biological interpretability compared to traditional
methods.

Abstract: Developing autonomous agents capable of mastering complex, multi-step tasks
in unpredictable, interactive environments presents a significant challenge.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for planning, existing
approaches often rely on problematic internal knowledge or make unrealistic
environmental assumptions. Although recent work explores learning planning
knowledge, they still retain limitations due to partial reliance on external
knowledge or impractical setups. Indeed, prior research has largely overlooked
developing agents capable of acquiring planning knowledge from scratch,
directly in realistic settings. While realizing this capability is necessary,
it presents significant challenges, primarily achieving robustness given the
substantial risk of incorporating LLMs' inaccurate knowledge. Moreover,
efficiency is crucial for practicality as learning can demand prohibitive
exploration. In response, we introduce Robust and Efficient Planning for
Open-world Agents (REPOA), a novel framework designed to tackle these issues.
REPOA features three key components: adaptive dependency learning and
fine-grained failure-aware operation memory to enhance robustness to knowledge
inaccuracies, and difficulty-based exploration to improve learning efficiency.
Our evaluation in two established open-world testbeds demonstrates REPOA's
robust and efficient planning, showcasing its capability to successfully obtain
challenging late-game items that were beyond the reach of prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基础模型时代，训练环境和测试环境之间的数据差异（OOD问题）阻碍了AI的泛化能力。特别是对于不满足独立同分布（IID）条件的图数据，这一问题更加复杂，尤其是涉及时间因素时。因此，研究时序图中哪些成分对标签最具有不变性和代表性，以实现鲁棒的不变学习。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）方法的误差有界不变链接选择器（Invariant Link Selector），能够在训练过程中区分不变成分和可变成分，从而使深度学习模型在不同测试场景中具有泛化能力。此外，还结合了任务特定的损失函数（如时序链接预测）来优化预训练模型。

Conclusion: 通过信息瓶颈方法和不变链接选择器，论文成功提升了时序图模型在分布外环境下的泛化能力，并在多个实际任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, Out-of- Distribution (OOD) problems, i.e.,
the data discrepancy between the training environments and testing
environments, hinder AI generalization. Further, relational data like graphs
disobeying the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes
the problem more challenging, especially much harder when it is associated with
time. Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal
graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most
invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information
Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector
that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the
training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different
testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable
optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss
functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pretrained models solve
real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise

*Xiaodong Ji,Hailin Zhang,Fangcheng Fu,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SALE方法，通过细粒度稀疏注意力加速长上下文LLM推理，保持模型精度同时实现3.36倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在长上下文处理时存在计算效率低和精度损失大的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用4bit量化的查询-键乘积进行细粒度权重估计，结合块稀疏注意力和自定义CUDA内核优化。

Result: 在64K以上长序列任务中，Llama-3.1-8B实现3.36倍加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: SALE无需训练即可无缝集成现有系统，在精度-效率权衡上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Many advanced Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long-context
processing, but the self-attention module becomes a bottleneck during the
prefilling stage of inference due to its quadratic time complexity with respect
to sequence length. Existing sparse attention methods accelerate attention
computation by skipping less significant regions of the attention map. However,
these approaches typically perform coarse-grained inspection of the attention
map, rendering considerable loss in model accuracy. In this paper, we propose
SALE, a fine-grained sparse attention method that accelerates the long-context
prefilling stage of LLM with negligible loss in model accuracy. SALE achieves
fast and accurate fine-grained attention weight estimation through 4-bit
quantized query-key products, followed by block-sparse attention to accelerate
prefilling computations. For importance evaluation for query-key pairs, we
adopt our Relative Attention Score metric, which offers significantly higher
efficiency within our framework. We implement a custom CUDA kernel optimized
for our approach for hardware efficiency, reducing the additional overhead to
approximately 11% of the full attention latency. Notably, SALE requires no
parameter training and can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems with
trivial code modifications. Experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate
that our method outperforms existing approaches in accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs, achieving at least 3.36x speedups on Llama-3.1-8B for sequences
longer than 64K while maintaining model quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出CodeV-R1框架，通过强化学习与可验证奖励训练大语言模型生成Verilog代码，解决EDA领域三大挑战，并取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）扩展到电子设计自动化（EDA）领域，特别是从自然语言规范自动生成硬件描述语言（如Verilog），面临三大挑战：缺乏自动化验证环境、高质量自然语言-代码对稀缺、RLVR计算成本高昂。

Method: 1. 开发基于规则的测试平台生成器进行鲁棒等价性检查；2. 提出往返数据合成方法生成高质量数据集；3. 采用两阶段'蒸馏后强化学习'训练流程，结合新型RLVR算法DAPO降低训练成本。

Result: CodeV-R1-7B模型在VerilogEval v2和RTLLM v1.1上分别达到68.6%和72.9%的pass@1，超越先前最优方法12~20%，性能媲美671B参数的DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: CodeV-R1框架有效解决了EDA领域Verilog生成的三大挑战，模型性能显著提升，相关资源将开源以促进EDA和LLM社区研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained via reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved breakthroughs on tasks with explicit,
automatable verification, such as software programming and mathematical
problems. Extending RLVR to electronic design automation (EDA), especially
automatically generating hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog
from natural-language (NL) specifications, however, poses three key challenges:
the lack of automated and accurate verification environments, the scarcity of
high-quality NL-code pairs, and the prohibitive computation cost of RLVR. To
this end, we introduce CodeV-R1, an RLVR framework for training Verilog
generation LLMs. First, we develop a rule-based testbench generator that
performs robust equivalence checking against golden references. Second, we
propose a round-trip data synthesis method that pairs open-source Verilog
snippets with LLM-generated NL descriptions, verifies code-NL-code consistency
via the generated testbench, and filters out inequivalent examples to yield a
high-quality dataset. Third, we employ a two-stage "distill-then-RL" training
pipeline: distillation for the cold start of reasoning abilities, followed by
adaptive DAPO, our novel RLVR algorithm that can reduce training cost by
adaptively adjusting sampling rate. The resulting model, CodeV-R1-7B, achieves
68.6% and 72.9% pass@1 on VerilogEval v2 and RTLLM v1.1, respectively,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 12~20%, while matching or even exceeding
the performance of 671B DeepSeek-R1. We will release our model, training
pipeline, and dataset to facilitate research in EDA and LLM communities.

*Yipan Wei,Yuchen Zou,Yapeng Li,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDEA提出了一种联邦解耦聚合方法，有效解决多任务联合训练中的异质性问题，无需任务标签或架构修改即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多任务学习方法难以在任务目标、标签空间和优化路径差异大的实际场景中实现有效的联合训练，需要一种能聚合异质任务到统一模型的方法。

Method: FedDEA通过响应强度动态识别任务相关维度，并通过重新缩放增强优化效果，实现任务级解耦聚合。

Result: 实验表明FedDEA能轻松集成到主流联邦优化算法中，在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context数据集上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: FedDEA在高度异质任务设置下展现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，为隐私保护的多任务协作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) enables multiple clients performing
heterogeneous tasks without exchanging their local data, offering broad
potential for privacy preserving multi-task collaboration. However, most
existing methods focus on building personalized models for each client and
unable to support the aggregation of multiple heterogeneous tasks into a
unified model. As a result, in real-world scenarios where task objectives,
label spaces, and optimization paths vary significantly, conventional FMTL
methods struggle to achieve effective joint training. To address this
challenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an
update-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task
model integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions
based on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization
effectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses
cross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a
unified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural
modifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly.
Experimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various
mainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers
significant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and
PASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization
capabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着单token成本降低，微调SLMs在现实应用中的优势（如更快推理、更低成本）可能不再明显。本文旨在证明在需要结构化输出的特定领域任务中，SLMs仍具有质量优势。

Method: 比较微调SLM与提示LLMs在生成JSON格式低代码工作流任务上的表现，并进行系统性错误分析。

Result: 尽管良好的提示能产生合理结果，但微调SLM平均提升10%的质量。

Conclusion: 对于需要结构化输出的特定领域任务，微调SLMs仍具有显著的质量优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of
complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the
advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world
applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In
this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require
structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning
an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in
JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results,
fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic
error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Conclusion: 通过理论框架和原型学习的结合，论文成功缩小了真实小样本数据与合成数据之间的差距，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of
labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a
promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples
often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and
synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical
framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on
supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More
importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic
samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building
upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that
integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model
training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic
data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them
across multiple datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Best-of-Both-Worlds框架下的算法在随机情境中与理论下界存在显著差距，特别是在存在对抗性延迟的环境中表现不佳。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一种新算法，通过优化延迟处理机制，在对抗性情境中使用√KT + √D的遗憾上界，在随机情境中采用与子最优间隙和最大缺失观测数相关的遗憾界。

Result: 该算法在对抗性情境中达到接近最优的遗憾界O~(√KT + √D)，在随机情境中首次匹配理论下界，并将已知最佳结果的第二项改进K倍。

Conclusion: 这是首个在延迟环境下同时匹配随机和对抗性情境理论下界的BoBW算法，为延迟老虎机问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the multi-armed bandit problem with adversarially chosen delays in
the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) framework, which aims to achieve near-optimal
performance in both stochastic and adversarial environments. While prior work
has made progress toward this goal, existing algorithms suffer from significant
gaps to the known lower bounds, especially in the stochastic settings. Our main
contribution is a new algorithm that, up to logarithmic factors, matches the
known lower bounds in each setting individually.
  In the adversarial case, our algorithm achieves regret of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + \sqrt{D})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic
terms, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $K$ is the number of arms, and $D$ is
the cumulative delay. In the stochastic case, we provide a regret bound which
scale as $\sum_{i:\Delta_i>0}\left(\log T/\Delta_i\right) + \frac{1}{K}\sum
\Delta_i \sigma_{max}$, where $\Delta_i$ is the sub-optimality gap of arm $i$
and $\sigma_{\max}$ is the maximum number of missing observations.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BoBW algorithm to
simultaneously match the lower bounds in both stochastic and adversarial
regimes in delayed environment. Moreover, even beyond the BoBW setting, our
stochastic regret bound is the first to match the known lower bound under
adversarial delays, improving the second term over the best known result by a
factor of $K$.

Motivation: 尽管混合专家网络在现代深度学习中的效率已被实证验证，但其建模复杂任务的理论基础仍不清晰。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了浅层和深层MoEs在低维流形上的函数逼近能力，以及其组合稀疏性表现。

Result: 证明浅层MoEs可高效逼近低维流形上的函数；深层MoEs能以指数级数量逼近具有组合稀疏性的分段函数。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MoEs架构中门控机制、专家数量等关键组件的作用，为MoE变体设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in
modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical
foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly
understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power
of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors:
low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can
efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds,
overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that
$\cO(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise
functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can
exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the
roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs,
including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the
number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种动态恶意软件分类框架，通过提取Windows PE文件运行时的API调用参数，将行为数据转换为时间模式并转化为灰度图像，利用CNN模型实现高精度分类，平均准确率达98.36%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于攻击者常使用高级混淆技术使恶意软件难以被静态分析检测，传统静态分析方法对多态和变形恶意软件无效，因此需要动态检测方法来监控恶意软件的运行时行为。

Method: 论文提出动态恶意软件分类框架，提取运行时API调用参数，将API名称、参数返回值等动态特征编码为时间模式，并转化为灰度图像，使用CNN模型进行特征学习和分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法平均准确率达98.36%，不仅能高精度分类恶意软件和良性软件，还对典型规避策略表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合动态分析和深度学习的方法能有效分类恶意软件，且对抗规避策略能力强，为恶意软件检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Malware detection and classification remains a topic of concern for
cybersecurity, since it is becoming common for attackers to use advanced
obfuscation on their malware to stay undetected. Conventional static analysis
is not effective against polymorphic and metamorphic malware as these change
their appearance without modifying their behavior, thus defying the analysis by
code structure alone. This makes it important to use dynamic detection that
monitors malware behavior at runtime. In this paper, we present a dynamic
malware categorization framework that extracts API argument calls at the
runtime execution of Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. Extracting and
encoding the dynamic features of API names, argument return values, and other
relative features, we convert raw behavioral data to temporal patterns. To
enhance feature portrayal, the generated patterns are subsequently converted
into grayscale pictures using a magma colormap. These improved photos are used
to teach a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model discriminative features,
which allows for reliable and accurate malware classification. Results from
experiments indicate that our method, with an average accuracy of 98.36% is
effective in classifying different classes of malware and benign by integrating
dynamic analysis and deep learning. It not only achieves high classification
accuracy but also demonstrates significant resilience against typical evasion
strategies.

Method: 证明VIP与全秩高斯的组合可表示为带平移项和先验输入的前向自回归流，并据此提出MIF架构，引入平移机制、先验信息和层次排序。

Result: MIF在多个层次和非层次基准测试中实现了更紧的后验逼近，性能达到或超过现有最优方法。

Conclusion: MIF通过理论指导和架构创新，显著提升了变分推断在复杂模型中的表现，为后验逼近提供了新思路。

Abstract: Variational inference often struggles with the posterior geometry exhibited
by complex hierarchical Bayesian models. Recent advances in flow-based
variational families and Variationally Inferred Parameters (VIP) each address
aspects of this challenge, but their formal relationship is unexplored. Here,
we prove that the combination of VIP and a full-rank Gaussian can be
represented exactly as a forward autoregressive flow augmented with a
translation term and input from the model's prior. Guided by this theoretical
insight, we introduce the Model-Informed Flow (MIF) architecture, which adds
the necessary translation mechanism, prior information, and hierarchical
ordering. Empirically, MIF delivers tighter posterior approximations and
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across a suite of hierarchical
and non-hierarchical benchmarks.

Motivation: 持续学习（CL）面临的主要挑战是灾难性遗忘，即不同任务间的知识干扰。现有的固定全局ETF方法存在不实用和性能有限的问题。

Method: 提出ProNC框架，通过逐步扩展ETF目标，添加新类原型作为顶点，确保所有类间的最大可分性，并结合蒸馏技术平衡新旧类目标。

Result: 实验表明，ProNC显著优于相关基线方法，同时保持了灵活性、简单性和高效性。

Conclusion: ProNC通过渐进式扩展ETF目标，有效解决了持续学习中的知识干扰问题，为CL领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to build an agent that can continuously learn a
sequence of tasks, where a key challenge, namely Catastrophic Forgetting,
persists due to the potential knowledge interference among different tasks. On
the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to converge to a terminal
state termed Neural Collapse during training, where all class prototypes
geometrically form a static simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). These
maximally and equally separated class prototypes make the ETF an ideal target
for model learning in CL to mitigate knowledge interference. Thus inspired,
several studies have emerged very recently to leverage a fixed global ETF in
CL, which however suffers from key drawbacks, such as impracticability and
limited performance.To address these challenges and fully unlock the potential
of ETF in CL, we propose Progressive Neural Collapse (ProNC), a novel framework
that completely removes the need of a fixed global ETF in CL. Specifically,
ProNC progressively expands the ETF target in a principled way by adding new
class prototypes as vertices for new tasks, ensuring maximal separability
across all encountered classes with minimal shifts from the previous ETF. We
next develop a new CL framework by plugging ProNC into commonly used CL
algorithm designs, where distillation is further leveraged to balance between
target shifting for old classes and target aligning for new classes. Extensive
experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms related baselines
while maintaining superior flexibility, simplicity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Data attribution methods, which quantify the influence of individual training
data points on a machine learning model, have gained increasing popularity in
data-centric applications in modern AI. Despite a recent surge of new methods
developed in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods
remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale
empirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data
attribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to
certain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning
algorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap
validation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires
retraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics
prohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open
challenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address
this challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of
hyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study,
we provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical
in many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we
propose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without
model retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard
data attribution benchmarks. Overall, our study identifies a fundamental yet
overlooked challenge in the practical application of data attribution, and
highlights the importance of careful discussion on hyperparameter selection in
future method development.

Abstract: Model editing techniques, particularly task arithmetic using task vectors,
have shown promise in efficiently modifying pre-trained models through
arithmetic operations like task addition and negation. Despite computational
advantages, these methods may inadvertently affect model fairness, creating
risks in sensitive applications like hate speech detection. However, the
fairness implications of task arithmetic remain largely unexplored, presenting
a critical gap in the existing literature. We systematically examine how
manipulating task vectors affects fairness metrics, including Demographic
Parity and Equalized Odds. To rigorously assess these effects, we benchmark
task arithmetic against full fine-tuning, a costly but widely used baseline,
and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. Additionally, we explore merging task vectors from models fine-tuned on
demographic subgroups vulnerable to hate speech, investigating whether fairness
outcomes can be controlled by adjusting task vector coefficients, potentially
enabling tailored model behavior. Our results offer novel insights into the
fairness implications of model editing and establish a foundation for
fairness-aware and responsible model editing practices.

Motivation: 为了在不修改基础优化器内部逻辑和超参数的情况下，加速语言模型的预训练过程并提升性能。

Method: GradPower对梯度向量应用元素级的符号-幂变换，然后将变换后的梯度输入基础优化器（如Adam）。

Result: 在不同架构、参数规模、数据集和学习率调度下，GradPower（尤其是AdamPower）均能显著降低终端损失，尤其在混合专家模型上效果最佳。

Conclusion: GradPower是一种高效且易于实现的梯度变换技术，能显著提升语言模型预训练效果，并兼容其他先进优化器。

Abstract: We propose GradPower, a lightweight gradient-transformation technique for
accelerating language model pre-training. Given a gradient vector $g=(g_i)_i$,
GradPower first applies the elementwise sign-power transformation:
$\varphi_p(g)=({\rm sign}(g_i)|g_i|^p)_{i}$ for a fixed $p>0$, and then feeds
the transformed gradient into a base optimizer. Notably, GradPower requires
only a single-line code change and no modifications to the base optimizer's
internal logic, including the hyperparameters. When applied to Adam (termed
AdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse
architectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4,
OpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The
most pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts
models with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly
with other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further
improvements. Finally, we provide theoretical analyses that reveal the
underlying mechanism of GradPower and highlights the influence of gradient
noise.

local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation
with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that
the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with
a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3,
Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show
through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these
LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest
singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token.
This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer
(and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and
observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and
global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact
locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal
representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token
prediction process.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AReaL，一个完全异步的强化学习系统，用于高效训练大型语言模型，解决了现有同步系统在GPU利用率和训练效率上的不足。

Conclusion: AReaL通过异步设计和系统级优化显著提升了强化学习训练大型语言模型的效率，为相关领域的研究和应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a trending paradigm for training large
language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs
requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient
training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous
by alternating generation and training in a batch setting, where the rollouts
in each training batch are generated by the same (or latest) model. This
stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency.
Generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before
model update, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a
\emph{fully asynchronous} RL system that completely decouples generation from
training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without
waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is
collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations,
leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training,
AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data
staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle
outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning
benchmarks show that AReaL achieves \textbf{up to 2.57$\times$ training
speedup} compared to the best synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs
and matched or even improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available
at https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/.

*Gengze Xu,Wei Yao,Ziqiao Wang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过理论分析弱到强泛化现象，提出学生模型通过逼近教师后验均值而非模仿单个教师能更好实现性能超越，并验证反向交叉熵损失的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弱到强泛化现象（学生模型通过弱教师标注数据训练后超越教师性能）的理论机制，突破现有理论对假设类别凸性等限制性假设。

Method: 采用Bregman散度的广义偏差-方差分解框架，分析学生与教师模型的预测差异对泛化差距的影响，并通过具体案例验证理论。

Result: 证明学生模型容量足够大时可收敛至教师后验均值，避免过拟合并降低预测熵能促进弱到强泛化，反向交叉熵损失对教师预测不确定性更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 理论分析与实验表明，通过控制模型容量、优化损失函数设计（如反向交叉熵）可系统性提升弱监督学习中的学生模型性能。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) refers to the phenomenon where a strong
student model, trained on a dataset labeled by a weak teacher, ultimately
outperforms the teacher on the target task. Recent studies attribute this
performance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher
models. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG
through a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.
Specifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student
and teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While
this aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive
assumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class,
required in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge
when the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than
mimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that
if the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can
indeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that
avoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of
student's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the
reverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less
sensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically
verify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse
cross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了事故责任分配的准确性，并有效降低了智能体在交通事故中的责任。

Conclusion: 责任导向的奖励函数能够优化自动驾驶决策，减少违规行为，提升在复杂环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in autonomous driving employs a trial-and-error
mechanism, enhancing robustness in unpredictable environments. However,
crafting effective reward functions remains challenging, as conventional
approaches rely heavily on manual design and demonstrate limited efficacy in
complex scenarios. To address this issue, this study introduces a
responsibility-oriented reward function that explicitly incorporates traffic
regulations into the RL framework. Specifically, we introduced a Traffic
Regulation Knowledge Graph and leveraged Vision-Language Models alongside
Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques to automate reward assignment. This
integration guides agents to adhere strictly to traffic laws, thus minimizing
rule violations and optimizing decision-making performance in diverse driving
conditions. Experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed methodology
significantly improves the accuracy of assigning accident responsibilities and
effectively reduces the agent's liability in traffic incidents.

Motivation: 现有代码生成评估基准主要针对Python，难以高质量评估其他编程语言（如Swift）的能力，且自动翻译生成的Swift测试存在质量问题。

Method: 采用质量优先策略，手工创建包含28个Swift问题的SwiftEval基准，并评估44个主流代码大模型。

Result: 测试显示模型在需要语言特定功能的问题上表现显著下降，小规模模型尤为明显。

Conclusion: SwiftEval填补了Swift评估基准的空白，证明语言特定特征对模型性能评估至关重要。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant
advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are
primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other
programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely
established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we
identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them
insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift.
Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and
generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with
LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the
first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted
problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant
LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most
noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.

Abstract: Hyperbolic deep learning leverages the metric properties of hyperbolic spaces
to develop efficient and informative embeddings of hierarchical data. Here, we
focus on the solvable group structure of hyperbolic spaces, which follows
naturally from their construction as symmetric spaces. This dual nature of Lie
group and Riemannian manifold allows us to propose a new class of hyperbolic
deep learning algorithms where group homomorphisms are interleaved with
metric-preserving diffeomorphisms. The resulting algorithms, which we call
Cartan networks, show promising results on various benchmark data sets and open
the way to a novel class of hyperbolic deep learning architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReCalKV提出了一种KV缓存压缩方法，通过针对Key和Value的不同策略优化长上下文推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长上下文推理能力受限于KV缓存的高内存需求，现有压缩方法存在额外计算或性能下降问题。

Method: 对Key采用头相似性重排序(HSR)，对Value采用离线校准矩阵融合(OCMF)，分别优化压缩策略。

Result: 实验表明ReCalKV在低秩压缩方法中表现优异，高压缩比下性能损失最小。

Conclusion: ReCalKV有效解决了KV缓存压缩的挑战，为长上下文推理提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance, yet their
capability on long-context reasoning is often constrained by the excessive
memory required to store the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache
compression an essential step toward enabling efficient long-context reasoning.
Recent methods have explored reducing the hidden dimensions of the KV cache,
but many introduce additional computation through projection layers or suffer
from significant performance degradation under high compression ratios. To
address these challenges, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training KV cache
compression method that reduces the hidden dimensions of the KV cache. We
develop distinct compression strategies for Keys and Values based on their
different roles and varying importance in the attention mechanism. For Keys, we
propose Head-wise Similarity-aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters similar
heads and applies grouped SVD to the key projection matrix, reducing additional
computation while preserving accuracy. For Values, we propose Offline
Calibration and Matrix Fusion (OCMF) to preserve accuracy without extra
computational overhead. Experiments show that ReCalKV outperforms existing
low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal
performance loss. Code is available at:

Method: 将SAEs和ITDA应用于Flux 1文本到图像扩散模型，并通过视觉自动化解释流程评估嵌入的可解释性。

Result: SAEs能准确重构残差流嵌入，并在可解释性上优于MLP神经元；ITDA与SAEs具有相当的可解释性。

Conclusion: SAEs和ITDA在大型扩散模型中表现出良好的可解释性和控制能力，为模型激活分解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language
model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied
successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion
models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently
proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set
of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with
gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large
text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of
embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline.
We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat
MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image
generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable
interpretability to SAEs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach to cluster refinement and anomaly
detection in datasets. We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively reduces
the intra-cluster variance of N clusters until a global minimum is reached,
yielding tighter clusters than the standard k-means algorithm. We evaluate the
method using intrinsic measures for unsupervised learning, including the
silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index, and
extend it to anomaly detection by identifying points whose assignment causes a
significant variance increase. External validation on synthetic data and the
UCI Breast Cancer and UCI Wine Quality datasets employs the Jaccard similarity
score, V-measure, and F1 score. Results show variance reductions of 18.7% and
88.1% on the synthetic and Wine Quality datasets, respectively, along with
accuracy and F1 score improvements of 22.5% and 20.8% on the Wine Quality
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型依赖人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）确保安全，但仍面临三大挑战：人工标注低效高成本、对抗攻击多样性以及反馈偏见和奖励攻击风险。

Method: APL方法包含三项关键技术：基于模型内在偏好的直接有害性度量、条件生成对抗样本的合成器，以及带自动闭环反馈的迭代训练框架。

Result: 实验显示APL将Mistral-7B的有害输出率从5.88%降至0.43%，攻击成功率降低65%，同时保持MT-Bench得分6.59（基线6.78）的实用性。

Conclusion: APL通过自动化对抗训练有效提升语言模型安全性，在保持性能的同时显著降低对抗攻击脆弱性。

Abstract: Modern language models often rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) to encourage safe behaviors. However, they remain vulnerable to
adversarial attacks due to three key limitations: (1) the inefficiency and high
cost of human annotation, (2) the vast diversity of potential adversarial
attacks, and (3) the risk of feedback bias and reward hacking. To address these
challenges, we introduce Adversarial Preference Learning (APL), an iterative
adversarial training method incorporating three key innovations. First, a
direct harmfulness metric based on the model's intrinsic preference
probabilities, eliminating reliance on external assessment. Second, a
conditional generative attacker that synthesizes input-specific adversarial
variations. Third, an iterative framework with automated closed-loop feedback,
enabling continuous adaptation through vulnerability discovery and mitigation.
Experiments on Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 demonstrate that APL significantly
enhances robustness, achieving 83.33% harmlessness win rate over the base model
(evaluated by GPT-4o), reducing harmful outputs from 5.88% to 0.43% (measured
by LLaMA-Guard), and lowering attack success rate by up to 65% according to
HarmBench. Notably, APL maintains competitive utility, with an MT-Bench score
of 6.59 (comparable to the baseline 6.78) and an LC-WinRate of 46.52% against
the base model.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in offline multi-task reinforcement learning
(MTRL) have harnessed the powerful capabilities of the Transformer
architecture, most approaches focus on a limited number of tasks, with scaling
to extremely massive tasks remaining a formidable challenge. In this paper, we
first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and
further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to
counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates.
Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE)
framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's
parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the
optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT)
backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a
three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal
performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of
experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion
on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability,
successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the
web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information.
To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to
remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact
unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data --
is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against
privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by
introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact
unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by
guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model,
we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model
guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves
extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common
benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our
attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight
real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our
findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase
the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods
to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning
models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

Motivation: SAM优化器虽然能提升模型的泛化能力，但其扰动半径和学习率需手动调整，限制了实际应用。

Result: 理论证明LightSAM在弱假设下能理想收敛，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LightSAM解决了SAM的参数敏感性问题，实现了参数无关的优化。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimizer enhances the generalization
ability of the machine learning model by exploring the flat minima landscape
through weight perturbations. Despite its empirical success, SAM introduces an
additional hyper-parameter, the perturbation radius, which causes the
sensitivity of SAM to it. Moreover, it has been proved that the perturbation
radius and learning rate of SAM are constrained by problem-dependent parameters
to guarantee convergence. These limitations indicate the requirement of
parameter-tuning in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the
algorithm LightSAM which sets the perturbation radius and learning rate of SAM
adaptively, thus extending the application scope of SAM. LightSAM employs three
popular adaptive optimizers, including AdaGrad-Norm, AdaGrad and Adam, to
replace the SGD optimizer for weight perturbation and model updating, reducing
sensitivity to parameters. Theoretical results show that under weak
assumptions, LightSAM could converge ideally with any choices of perturbation
radius and learning rate, thus achieving parameter-agnostic. We conduct
preliminary experiments on several deep learning tasks, which together with the
theoretical findings validate the the effectiveness of LightSAM.

Conclusion: 论文为处理多组向量数据的神经网络提供了Lipschitz常数的理论分析框架，并验证了其在扰动稳定性和分布偏移泛化中的重要性。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important
properties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus
useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior
work has focused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as
sets or multisets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data.
These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function,
such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a
single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether
these aggregation functions are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three
distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz
constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is
Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions.
Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz
constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we
also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under
distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct
a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.

Conclusion: 所提两阶段策略能同时处理多种异构性，显著提升MTL性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as an imperative machine learning tool
to solve multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been successfully
applied to healthcare, marketing, and biomedical fields. However, in order to
borrow information across different tasks effectively, it is essential to
utilize both homogeneous and heterogeneous information. Among the extensive
literature on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity are presented in MTL
problems, such as block-wise, distribution, and posterior heterogeneity.
Existing methods, however, struggle to tackle these forms of heterogeneity
simultaneously in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a two-step
learning strategy for MTL which addresses the aforementioned heterogeneity.
First, we impute the missing blocks using shared representations extracted from
homogeneous source across different tasks. Next, we disentangle the mappings
between input features and responses into a shared component and a
task-specific component, respectively, thereby enabling information borrowing
through the shared component. Our numerical experiments and real-data analysis
from the ADNI database demonstrate the superior MTL performance of the proposed
method compared to other competing methods.

Abstract: Automated evaluation of movement quality holds significant potential for
enhancing physiotherapeutic treatments and sports training by providing
objective, real-time feedback. However, the effectiveness of deep learning
models in assessing movements captured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) is
often hampered by limited data availability, class imbalance, and label
ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel data augmentation method that
generates realistic IMU data using musculoskeletal simulations integrated with
systematic modifications of movement trajectories. Crucially, our approach
ensures biomechanical plausibility and allows for automatic, reliable labeling
by combining inverse kinematic parameters with a knowledge-based evaluation
strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that augmented variants closely
resembles real-world data, significantly improving the classification accuracy
and generalization capability of neural network models. Additionally, we
highlight the benefits of augmented data for patient-specific fine-tuning
scenarios, particularly when only limited subject-specific training examples
are available. Our findings underline the practicality and efficacy of this
augmentation method in overcoming common challenges faced by deep learning
applications in physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.

*Amit Peleg,Naman Deep Singh,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLIC是一种基于多图像及其关联标题的新型训练技术，旨在提升CLIP模型的组合推理能力，同时在检索性能上取得一致增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本分类和检索方面表现出色，但在组合推理（理解概念间关系）方面存在不足。SugarCrepe++基准测试显示，以往改进组合性的方法主要提升了词汇敏感性，却忽视了语义理解，且检索性能往往下降。

Method: 本文提出了CLIC（Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP），一种基于多图像及其关联标题的新型微调方法，旨在同时提升词汇和语义理解能力。

Result: CLIC在不同架构和预训练的CLIP模型上均提升了组合性，并在检索性能上取得一致增益，甚至在最新的CLIPS模型上也实现了检索性能的提升。

Conclusion: CLIC通过短期微调显著提升了组合推理能力和检索性能，成为SugarCrepe++基准测试上最佳的组合性CLIP模型。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often
struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the
relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that
previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical
sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream
retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that
improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce
CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a
novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated
captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as
differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic
understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This
even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance.
Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in
retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our
models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io

*Md Shahriar Rahim Siddiqui,Moshe Eliasof,Eldad Haber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Graph Flow Matching (GFM)，通过图神经网络模块聚合邻域信息，提升流匹配模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配网络独立预测每个点的速度，忽略了生成轨迹上点之间的相关性，可能影响速度预测的准确性。

Method: GFM将学习到的速度分解为反应项（标准流匹配网络）和扩散项（通过图神经网络模块聚合邻域信息），以反应-扩散形式增强速度预测。

Result: 在五个图像生成基准测试中，GFM显著提高了FID和召回率，证明了其作为现有流匹配架构模块化增强的有效性。

Conclusion: GFM以最小的额外计算成本，通过引入局部上下文信息，显著提升了流匹配模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity
field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically
predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and
time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this
pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the
generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby
improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow
Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity
into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion
term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This
reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models
while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal
additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained
variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN
Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its
effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

Motivation: 现有时间图神经网络（TGNNs）往往忽略时间方向对因果拓扑的影响，缺乏能完整捕捉时间图因果拓扑的同构定义。

Method: 引入一致性事件图同构概念，开发时间版Weisfeiler-Leman算法，并基于事件图表示设计新型消息传递方案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在时间图分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过形式化时间图因果拓扑并改进TGNNs的消息传递机制，显著提升了模型表达能力。

Abstract: An important characteristic of temporal graphs is how the directed arrow of
time influences their causal topology, i.e., which nodes can possibly influence
each other causally via time-respecting paths. The resulting patterns are often
neglected by temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs). To formally analyze the
expressive power of TGNNs, we lack a generalization of graph isomorphism to
temporal graphs that fully captures their causal topology. Addressing this gap,
we introduce the notion of consistent event graph isomorphism, which utilizes a
time-unfolded representation of time-respecting paths in temporal graphs. We
compare this definition with existing notions of temporal graph isomorphisms.
We illustrate and highlight the advantages of our approach and develop a
temporal generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm to heuristically
distinguish non-isomorphic temporal graphs. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we derive a novel message passing scheme for temporal graph neural
networks that operates on the event graph representation of temporal graphs. An
experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs well in a temporal
graph classification experiment.

TL;DR: 提出Safety Polytope（SaP）方法，通过几何约束在表示空间直接增强大语言模型的安全性，无需修改权重即可检测和修正有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）存在输出有害内容及易受对抗攻击的安全风险，需一种不损害模型能力的安全增强方法。

Method: SaP在模型表示空间中构建安全多面体，通过几何边界划分安全/非安全区域，实现基于几何引导的检测与修正。

Result: 实验表明SaP能有效识别不道德输入、降低对抗攻击成功率，且不影响标准任务性能；多面体分面呈现安全语义的专门化特征。

Conclusion: 几何显式建模为LLM安全提供了可解释、非侵入性的解决方案，揭示了表示空间中安全概念的分布规律。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools but pose
significant safety risks through harmful outputs and vulnerability to
adversarial attacks. We propose SaP, short for Safety Polytope, a geometric
approach to LLM safety that learns and enforces multiple safety constraints
directly in the model's representation space. We develop a framework that
identifies safe and unsafe regions via the polytope's facets, enabling both
detection and correction of unsafe outputs through geometric steering. Unlike
existing approaches that modify model weights, SaP operates post-hoc in the
representation space, preserving model capabilities while enforcing safety
constraints. Experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that our method can
effectively detect unethical inputs, reduce adversarial attack success rates
while maintaining performance on standard tasks, thus highlighting the
importance of having an explicit geometric model for safety. Analysis of the
learned polytope facets reveals emergence of specialization in detecting
different semantic notions of safety, providing interpretable insights into how
safety is captured in LLMs' representation space.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种理论支持的统一预算感知（UBA）学习率调度方法，能在有限训练迭代预算下优于常见调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习率调度设计缺乏理论基础，依赖试错选择效率低下，尤其在预算受限场景下表现不佳。

Method: 构建预算感知优化框架，推导出由超参数φ控制的UBA调度，建立φ与条件数的理论关联并证明收敛性。

Result: UBA在视觉/语言任务、不同网络架构及规模下均超越常用调度策略，且仅需单一可解释超参数。

Conclusion: UBA为预算受限训练提供了理论可靠、通用性强的学习率调度方案，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: The expanding computational costs and limited resources underscore the
critical need for budgeted-iteration training, which aims to achieve optimal
learning within predetermined iteration budgets.While learning rate schedules
fundamentally govern the performance of different networks and tasks,
particularly in budgeted-iteration scenarios, their design remains largely
heuristic, lacking theoretical foundations.In addition, the optimal learning
rate schedule requires extensive trial-and-error selection, making the training
process inefficient.In this work, we propose the Unified Budget-Aware (UBA)
schedule, a theoretically grounded learning rate schedule that consistently
outperforms commonly-used schedules among diverse architectures and tasks under
different constrained training budgets.First, we bridge the gap by constructing
a novel training budget-aware optimization framework, which explicitly accounts
for the robustness to landscape curvature variations.From this framework, we
derive the UBA schedule, controlled by a single hyper-parameter $\varphi$ that
provides a trade-off between flexibility and simplicity, eliminating the need
for per-network numerical optimization. Moreover, we establish a theoretical
connection between $\varphi$ and the condition number, adding interpretation
and justification to our approach. Besides, we prove the convergence for
different values of $\varphi$.We offer practical guidelines for its selection
via theoretical analysis and empirical results.xtensive experimental results
show that UBA \textit{consistently surpasses} the commonly-used schedules
across diverse vision and language tasks, spanning network architectures (e.g.,
ResNet, OLMo) and scales, under different training-iteration budgets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于重建方法的OOD检测框架MOOD，通过掩码图像建模作为前置任务，显著提升了OOD检测性能，无需使用OOD样本即可超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测方法多采用识别式方法学习ID特征，但容易学习到捷径而非全面表征。作者发现重建方法能显著提升OOD检测性能，并探索了其主要贡献因素。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模（Masked Image Modeling）作为前置任务，构建OOD检测框架MOOD，通过学习ID数据集的内在数据分布来区分OOD样本。

Result: MOOD在单类OOD检测上比现有SOTA提升5.7%，多类OOD检测提升3.0%，近分布OOD检测提升2.1%，甚至优于使用少量OOD样本的检测方法。

Conclusion: 重建式前置任务能为OOD检测提供通用且高效的先验，MOOD框架在不使用任何OOD样本的情况下显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: The core of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to learn the
in-distribution (ID) representation, which is distinguishable from OOD samples.
Previous work applied recognition-based methods to learn the ID features, which
tend to learn shortcuts instead of comprehensive representations. In this work,
we find surprisingly that simply using reconstruction-based methods could boost
the performance of OOD detection significantly. We deeply explore the main
contributors of OOD detection and find that reconstruction-based pretext tasks
have the potential to provide a generally applicable and efficacious prior,
which benefits the model in learning intrinsic data distributions of the ID
dataset. Specifically, we take Masked Image Modeling as a pretext task for our
OOD detection framework (MOOD). Without bells and whistles, MOOD outperforms
previous SOTA of one-class OOD detection by 5.7%, multi-class OOD detection by
3.0%, and near-distribution OOD detection by 2.1%. It even defeats the
10-shot-per-class outlier exposure OOD detection, although we do not include
any OOD samples for our detection. Codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的剪枝和压缩技术通常未考虑网络权重的结构，限制了其效果。本文旨在探索平滑正则化对神经网络训练和模型压缩的影响。

Method: 在训练过程中应用核范数、一阶和二阶导数惩罚，促进结构平滑性，并结合奇异值分解压缩方法。

Result: 平滑模型在标准剪枝方法下表现更优，实现了最先进的压缩效果（如CIFAR-10上平滑ResNet-18准确率达91%，参数减少70%）。

Conclusion: 平滑正则化能有效提升模型压缩效果，无需微调即可实现高性能压缩。

Abstract: Compressing and pruning large machine learning models has become a critical
step towards their deployment in real-world applications. Standard pruning and
compression techniques are typically designed without taking the structure of
the network's weights into account, limiting their effectiveness. We explore
the impact of smooth regularization on neural network training and model
compression. By applying nuclear norm, first- and second-order derivative
penalties of the weights during training, we encourage structured smoothness
while preserving predictive performance on par with non-smooth models. We find
that standard pruning methods often perform better when applied to these smooth
models. Building on this observation, we apply a
Singular-Value-Decomposition-based compression method that exploits the
underlying smooth structure and approximates the model's weight tensors by
smaller low-rank tensors. Our approach enables state-of-the-art compression
without any fine-tuning - reaching up to $91\%$ accuracy on a smooth ResNet-18
on CIFAR-10 with $70\%$ fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型训练目标HierarchicalTopK，使稀疏自编码器能同时优化多个稀疏度水平，在保持高解释性的同时提升灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）的稀疏度在训练时固定，不同稀疏度需求需训练多个模型，导致计算成本高。本文旨在解决这一灵活性问题。

Method: 引入HierarchicalTopK训练目标，通过单一SAE模型同时优化多个稀疏度水平的重构效果。

Result: 在Gemma-2 2B模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了稀疏度与解释方差的帕累托最优平衡，且在高稀疏度下仍保持高解释性评分。

Conclusion: HierarchicalTopK填补了SAE设计中灵活性与可解释性之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be powerful tools for interpreting
neural networks by decomposing hidden representations into disentangled,
interpretable features via sparsity constraints. However, conventional SAEs are
constrained by the fixed sparsity level chosen during training; meeting
different sparsity requirements therefore demands separate models and increases
the computational footprint during both training and evaluation. We introduce a
novel training objective, \emph{HierarchicalTopK}, which trains a single SAE to
optimise reconstructions across multiple sparsity levels simultaneously.
Experiments with Gemma-2 2B demonstrate that our approach achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-offs between sparsity and explained variance,
outperforming traditional SAEs trained at individual sparsity levels. Further
analysis shows that HierarchicalTopK preserves high interpretability scores
even at higher sparsity. The proposed objective thus closes an important gap
between flexibility and interpretability in SAE design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)依赖全局图像编码，在面向对象的现实场景中表达能力有限，难以处理超越单标签分类的复杂视觉任务。

Method: 引入OCB框架，整合CBMs与预训练面向对象基础模型，通过对象-概念编码聚合策略增强模型能力。

Result: 实验表明OCB在复杂图像数据集上优于传统CBMs，同时保持决策可解释性。消融研究验证了框架关键组件的有效性。

Conclusion: OCB通过对象中心化设计突破了CBMs的局限性，为复杂视觉任务提供了高性能且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical
challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by
extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image
encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept
activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on
holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric
real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision
tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines
the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models,
boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image
datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components
of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings.
The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make
interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: Recent work in online speech spectrogram inversion effectively combines Deep
Learning with the Gradient Theorem to predict phase derivatives directly from

squares, resulting in a high quality reconstruction. In this work, we introduce
three innovations that drastically reduce computational cost, while maintaining
high quality: Firstly, we introduce a novel neural network architecture with
just 8k parameters, 30 times smaller than previous state of the art. Secondly,
increasing latency by 1 hop size allows us to further halve the cost of the
neural inference step. Thirdly, we we observe that the least squares problem
features a tridiagonal matrix and propose a linear-complexity solver for the
least squares step that leverages tridiagonality and positive-semidefiniteness,
achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude. We release samples online.

Abstract: The Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problem plays a crucial role in
power system operations, ensuring voltage stability and minimizing power
losses. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly within the ``learning
to optimize'' framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD
solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results.
While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic
datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely
unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a
publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural
characteristics of Uruguay's electrical grid and nearly two years of real-world
operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given
Uruguay's high penetration of renewable energy, the ORPD problem has become the
primary optimization challenge in its power network. Second, we assess the
impact of real-world data on learning-based ORPD solutions, revealing a
significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to
actual demand and generation inputs. Our results highlight the limitations of
existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real
grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By
providing this dataset, we aim to facilitate further research into robust
learning-based optimization techniques for power system management.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task,
spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning
and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods
often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct
value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and
contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g.,
ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning
capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing
TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can
slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time
series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this
paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates
TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies
to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and
evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal
that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities,
especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While
preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors
of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations.
We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting
paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF
frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite their central role in the success of foundational models and
large-scale language modeling, the theoretical foundations governing the
operation of Transformers remain only partially understood. Contemporary
research has largely focused on their representational capacity for language
comprehension and their prowess in in-context learning, frequently under
idealized assumptions such as linearized attention mechanisms. Initially
conceived to model sequence-to-sequence transformations, a fundamental and
unresolved question is whether Transformers can robustly perform functional
regression over sequences of input tokens. This question assumes heightened
importance given the inherently non-Euclidean geometry underlying real-world
data distributions. In this work, we establish that Transformers equipped with
softmax-based nonlinear attention are uniformly consistent when tasked with
executing Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, provided both the inputs and
outputs are embedded in hyperbolic space. We derive deterministic upper bounds
on the empirical error which, in the asymptotic regime, decay at a provable
rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2d})$, where $t$ denotes the number of input tokens
and $d$ the embedding dimensionality. Notably, our analysis subsumes the
Euclidean setting as a special case, recovering analogous convergence
guarantees parameterized by the intrinsic dimensionality of the data manifold.
These theoretical insights are corroborated through empirical evaluations on
real-world datasets involving both continuous and categorical response
variables.

of vector-matrix pairs, model directional composition in multiple dimensions
while preserving structural coherence through commutative linear operators.
  We show that the framework that unifies several well-known linear transforms
in signal processing and data analysis. In this framework, data indices are
embedded into a composite structure that decomposes into simpler components. We
show that classic transforms such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), the
Walsh transform, and the Hadamard transform are special cases of our algebraic
structure. The framework provides a systematic way to derive these transforms
by appropriately choosing vector and matrix pairs. By subsuming classical
transforms within a common structure, the framework also enables the
development of learnable transformations tailored to specific data modalities
and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图异常检测方法难以捕捉高阶交互变化，而这些变化对复杂结构异常识别至关重要。

Method: 基于单纯复形的Hodge拉普拉斯谱特性建模数据点多路交互，结合高维单纯结构提升检测效率和准确性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，HLSAD在事件和变化点检测上优于现有图方法。

Conclusion: HLSAD通过高阶交互建模有效提升异常检测性能，为复杂结构分析提供新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HLSAD, a novel method for detecting anomalies in
time-evolving simplicial complexes. While traditional graph anomaly detection
techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in
higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural
anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the
underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach
leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes
to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating
higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances
both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change
points.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-Steering提出了一种非线性多标签分类器方法，通过梯度计算干预方向，解决了大语言模型中多行为属性控制的干扰问题，无需线性假设和单独调整属性向量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在推理时控制多个行为属性存在挑战，主要由于属性间的干扰和线性引导方法的局限性，这些方法假设激活空间中的行为是加性的且需要针对每个属性进行调整。

Method: K-Steering方法训练一个非线性多标签分类器，基于隐藏激活并通过梯度计算干预方向，避免了线性假设，无需存储和调整单独的属性向量，支持动态行为组合而无需重新训练。

Result: 在ToneBank和DebateMix两个新基准上的实验表明，K-Steering在三种模型家族中均优于基线方法，能够准确引导多种行为，得到了基于激活的分类器和基于LLM的评判者的验证。

Conclusion: K-Steering提供了一种统一且灵活的方法，有效解决了大语言模型中多行为属性控制的难题，具有较好的性能和动态组合能力。

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at
inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes
and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior
in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering,
a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label
classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via
gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the
need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic
composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose
two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral
control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both
activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering
outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

Abstract: Complex piezoelectric systems are foundational in industrial applications.
Their performance, however, is challenged by the nonlinear voltage-displacement
hysteretic relationships. Efficient characterization methods are, therefore,
essential for reliable design, monitoring, and maintenance. Recently proposed
neural operator methods serve as surrogates for system characterization but
face two pressing issues: interpretability and generalizability.
State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural operators are black-boxes, providing little
insight into the learned operator. Additionally, generalizing them to novel
voltages and predicting displacement profiles beyond the training domain is
challenging, limiting their practical use. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes a neuro-symbolic operator (NSO) framework that derives the
analytical operators governing hysteretic relationships. NSO first learns a
Fourier neural operator mapping voltage fields to displacement profiles,
followed by a library-based sparse model discovery method, generating white-box
parsimonious models governing the underlying hysteresis. These models enable
accurate and interpretable prediction of displacement profiles across varying
and out-of-distribution voltage fields, facilitating generalizability. The
potential of NSO is demonstrated by accurately predicting voltage-displacement
hysteresis, including butterfly-shaped relationships. Moreover, NSO predicts
displacement profiles even for noisy and low-fidelity voltage data, emphasizing
its robustness. The results highlight the advantages of NSO compared to SOTA
neural operators and model discovery methods on several evaluation metrics.
Consequently, NSO contributes to characterizing complex piezoelectric systems
while improving the interpretability and generalizability of neural operators,
essential for design, monitoring, maintenance, and other real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准傅里叶神经算子在求解偏微分方程时难以保持质量守恒、动量守恒等关键物理定律，现有方法通过设计损失函数或后处理实现，但无法同时满足精确性和自适应性。

Method: 提出一种自适应校正方法，通过可学习矩阵在训练过程中动态调整解，确保输出严格满足守恒定律，同时保持模型的灵活性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种典型偏微分方程上均优于现有方法，且理论证明其数据损失不劣于最优守恒满足的FNO。

Conclusion: 自适应校正方法有效解决了FNO在守恒定律上的不足，为物理系统的精确建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have recently emerged as a promising and
efficient approach for learning the numerical solutions to partial differential
equations (PDEs) from data. However, standard FNO often fails to preserve key
conservation laws, such as mass conservation, momentum conservation, norm
conservation, etc., which are crucial for accurately modeling physical systems.
Existing methods for incorporating these conservation laws into Fourier neural
operators are achieved by designing related loss function or incorporating
post-processing method at the training time. None of them can both exactly and
adaptively correct the outputs to satisfy conservation laws, and our
experiments show that these methods can lead to inferior performance while
preserving conservation laws. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive
correction approach to ensure the conservation of fundamental quantities. Our
method introduces a learnable matrix to adaptively adjust the solution to
satisfy the conservation law during training. It ensures that the outputs
exactly satisfy the goal conservation law and allow for more flexibility and
adaptivity for the model to correct the outputs. We theoretically show that
applying our adaptive correction to an unconstrained FNO yields a solution with
data loss no worse than that of the best conservation-satisfying FNO. We
compare our approach with existing methods on a range of representative PDEs.
Experiment results show that our method consistently outperform other methods.

Motivation: 尽管生成式AI在新型化学品和材料发现方面取得了进展，但将这些发现转化为工业规模生产仍是一个关键瓶颈，因为需要开发全新的化学制造流程。当前的AI方法无法自动生成PFD或PID，而这些在规模化化学过程中至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel
chemicals and materials; however, transitioning these discoveries to
industrial-scale production remains a critical bottleneck, as it requires the
development of entirely new chemical manufacturing processes. Current AI
methods cannot auto-generate PFDs or PIDs, despite their critical role in
scaling chemical processes, while adhering to engineering constraints. We
present a closed loop, physics aware framework for the automated generation of
industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates domain specialized
small scale language models (SLMs) (trained for chemical process QA tasks) with
first principles simulation, leveraging three key components: (1) a
hierarchical knowledge graph of process flow and instrumentation descriptions
for 1,020+ chemicals, (2) a multi-stage training pipeline that fine tunes
domain specialized SLMs on synthetic datasets via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Retrieval-Augmented Instruction
Tuning (RAIT), and (3) DWSIM based simulator in the loop validation to ensure
feasibility. To improve both runtime efficiency and model compactness, the
framework incorporates advanced inference time optimizations including
FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization,
and Test Time Inference Scaling and independently applies structural pruning
techniques (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce model
size with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the framework
generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity,
outperforms baseline methods in correctness, and generalizes to unseen
chemicals. By bridging AI-driven design with industrial-scale feasibility, this
work significantly reduces R&D timelines from lab discovery to plant
deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究为数据增强提升模型鲁棒性提供了统一的理论基础，并展示了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Model robustness indicates a model's capability to generalize well on
unforeseen distributional shifts, including data corruption, adversarial
attacks, and domain shifts. Data augmentation is one of the prevalent and
effective ways to enhance robustness. Despite the great success of
augmentations in different fields, a general theoretical understanding of their
efficacy in improving model robustness is lacking. We offer a unified
theoretical framework to clarify how augmentations can enhance model robustness
through the lens of loss surface flatness and PAC generalization bound. Our
work diverges from prior studies in that our analysis i) broadly encompasses
much of the existing augmentation methods, and ii) is not limited to specific
types of distribution shifts like adversarial attacks. We confirm our theories
through simulations on the existing common corruption and adversarial
robustness benchmarks based on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, as well as
domain generalization benchmarks including PACS and OfficeHome.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在点预测和概率预测上均优于广泛使用的方法，且参数更少、训练更快。

Conclusion: BCE方法有效解决了现有分类框架中忽略顺序结构的问题，同时提升了预测性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating
regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space
into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit
from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with
modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on
one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying
values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative
distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we
propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding
(BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This
encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the
model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a
classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network
architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated
convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach
outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting,
while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.

Abstract: Gaussian sketching, which consists of pre-multiplying the data with a random
Gaussian matrix, is a widely used technique for multiple problems in data
science and machine learning, with applications spanning computationally
efficient optimization, coded computing, and federated learning. This operation
also provides differential privacy guarantees due to its inherent randomness.
In this work, we revisit this operation through the lens of Renyi Differential
Privacy (RDP), providing a refined privacy analysis that yields significantly
tighter bounds than prior results. We then demonstrate how this improved
analysis leads to performance improvement in different linear regression
settings, establishing theoretical utility guarantees. Empirically, our methods
improve performance across multiple datasets and, in several cases, reduce
runtime.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了解释的变异性，提升了模型解释的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: Explainability is crucial for improving the transparency of black-box machine
learning models. With the advancement of explanation methods such as LIME and
SHAP, various XAI performance metrics have been developed to evaluate the
quality of explanations. However, different explainers can provide contrasting
explanations for the same prediction, introducing trade-offs across conflicting
quality metrics. Although available aggregation approaches improve robustness,
reducing explanations' variability, very limited research employed a
multi-criteria decision-making approach. To address this gap, this paper
introduces a multi-criteria rank-based weighted aggregation method that
balances multiple quality metrics simultaneously to produce an ensemble of
explanation models. Furthermore, we propose rank-based versions of existing XAI
metrics (complexity, faithfulness and stability) to better evaluate ranked
feature importance explanations. Extensive experiments on publicly available
datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model across these metrics.
Comparative analyses of various multi-criteria decision-making and rank
aggregation algorithms showed that TOPSIS and WSUM are the best candidates for
this use case.

Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale
datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize
a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model
performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level
optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning
the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested
optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a
promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean
space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,
overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed
HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential
volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like
structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz
hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is
measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By
optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated
into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards
the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving
their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning
in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model
performance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is
seamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments
on different datasets validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) methods have shown promising
problem-solving ability without requiring domain-specific expertise. Most
existing NCO methods use training and testing data with a fixed constraint
value and lack research on the effect of constraint tightness on the
performance of NCO methods. This paper takes the capacity-constrained vehicle
routing problem (CVRP) as an example to empirically analyze the NCO performance
under different tightness degrees of the capacity constraint. Our analysis
reveals that existing NCO methods overfit the capacity constraint, and they can
only perform satisfactorily on a small range of the constraint values but
poorly on other values. To tackle this drawback of existing NCO methods, we
develop an efficient training scheme that explicitly considers varying degrees
of constraint tightness and proposes a multi-expert module to learn a generally
adaptable solving strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed method
can effectively overcome the overfitting issue, demonstrating superior
performances on the CVRP and CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW) with various
constraint tightness degrees.

Abstract: Penalties are fraught and game-changing moments in soccer games that teams
explicitly prepare for. Consequently, there has been substantial interest in
analyzing them in order to provide advice to practitioners. From a data science
perspective, such analyses suffer from a significant limitation: they make the
unrealistic simplifying assumption that goalkeepers and takers select their
action -- where to dive and where to the place the kick -- independently of
each other. In reality, the choices that some goalkeepers make depend on the
taker's movements and vice-versa. This adds substantial complexity to the
problem because not all players have the same action capacities, that is, only
some players are capable of basing their decisions on their opponent's
movements. However, the small sample sizes on the player level mean that one
may have limited insights into a specific opponent's capacities. We address
these challenges by developing a player-agnostic simulation framework that can
evaluate the efficacy of different goalkeeper strategies. It considers a rich
set of choices and incorporates information about a goalkeeper's skills. Our
work is grounded in a large dataset of penalties that were annotated by penalty
experts and include aspects of both kicker and goalkeeper strategies. We show
how our framework can be used to optimize goalkeeper policies in real-world
situations.

Abstract: We investigate the distance function learned by message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) in specific tasks, aiming to capture the functional distance
between prediction targets that MPNNs implicitly learn. This contrasts with
previous work, which links MPNN distances on arbitrary tasks to structural
distances on graphs that ignore task-specific information. To address this gap,
we distill the distance between MPNN embeddings into an interpretable graph
distance. Our method uses optimal transport on the Weisfeiler Leman Labeling
Tree (WILT), where the edge weights reveal subgraphs that strongly influence
the distance between embeddings. This approach generalizes two well-known graph
kernels and can be computed in linear time. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that MPNNs define the relative position of embeddings by focusing
on a small set of subgraphs that are known to be functionally important in the
domain.

Abstract: Learning distributions over permutations is a fundamental problem in machine
learning, with applications in ranking, combinatorial optimization, structured
prediction, and data association. Existing methods rely on mixtures of
parametric families or neural networks with expensive variational inference
procedures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages
alternative representations for permutations, including Lehmer codes,
Fisher-Yates draws, and Insertion-Vectors. These representations form a
bijection with the symmetric group, allowing for unconstrained learning using
conventional deep learning techniques, and can represent any probability
distribution over permutations. Our approach enables a trade-off between
expressivity of the model family and computational requirements. In the least
expressive and most computationally efficient case, our method subsumes
previous families of well established probabilistic models over permutations,
including Mallow's and the Repeated Insertion Model. Experiments indicate our
method significantly outperforms current approaches on the jigsaw puzzle
benchmark, a common task for permutation learning. However, we argue this
benchmark is limited in its ability to assess learning probability
distributions, as the target is a delta distribution (i.e., a single correct
solution exists). We therefore propose two additional benchmarks: learning
cyclic permutations and re-ranking movies based on user preference. We show
that our method learns non-trivial distributions even in the least expressive
mode, while traditional models fail to even generate valid permutations in this
setting.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在拓扑估计方面带来了高度显著的改进。

Conclusion: 通过结合多流学习和测地线计算，论文有效解决了非平凡拓扑流形的建模问题，提升了拓扑估计的准确性。

Abstract: Real world data often lie on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds embedded in
high-dimensional spaces. This motivates learning degenerate normalizing flows
that map between the ambient space and a low-dimensional latent space. However,
if the manifold has a non-trivial topology, it can never be correctly learned
using a single flow. Instead multiple flows must be `glued together'. In this
paper, we first propose the general training scheme for learning such a
collection of flows, and secondly we develop the first numerical algorithms for
computing geodesics on such manifolds. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
leads to highly significant improvements in topology estimation.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种数字化历史房产评估记录的方法，结合OCR技术和回归模型，帮助量化1930年代美国住房政策对种族财富差距的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于历史房产评估记录多以物理形式存储，难以进行大规模量化分析，研究者希望通过数字化手段解决这一问题，以更准确地评估住房政策的历史影响。

Method: 研究采用两阶段方法：首先手动标注12,000多处房产卡片以训练和验证OCR技术，随后用OCR处理另外50,000处房产数据；对于无法应用OCR的情况，使用基于建筑特征的回归模型估算历史价值。

Result: 成功构建并发布了一个县的房产评估数据集，验证了OCR和回归模型的有效性，并测试了模型在其他县的通用性。

Conclusion: 这些低成本工具使学者、社区活动家和政策制定者能更好地分析红线政策的历史影响，为相关研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: Despite well-documented consequences of the U.S. government's 1930s housing
policies on racial wealth disparities, scholars have struggled to quantify its
precise financial effects due to the inaccessibility of historical property
appraisal records. Many counties still store these records in physical formats,
making large-scale quantitative analysis difficult. We present an approach
scholars can use to digitize historical housing assessment data, applying it to
build and release a dataset for one county. Starting from publicly available
scanned documents, we manually annotated property cards for over 12,000
properties to train and validate our methods. We use OCR to label data for an
additional 50,000 properties, based on our two-stage approach combining
classical computer vision techniques with deep learning-based OCR. For cases
where OCR cannot be applied, such as when scanned documents are not available,
we show how a regression model based on building feature data can estimate the
historical values, and test the generalizability of this model to other
counties. With these cost-effective tools, scholars, community activists, and
policy makers can better analyze and understand the historical impacts of
redlining.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了变分自编码器（VAEs）中隐含的归纳偏置——解缠粒度，并通过实验验证了其对解缠性能和ELBO推断的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管变分自编码器（VAEs）及其变体在学习语义上有意义的无监督解缠表示方面取得了成功，但缺乏明确的归纳偏置使得无监督解缠难以实现。本文旨在探索VAEs中隐含的归纳偏置。

Method: 通过分析β-TCVAE中的总相关性，研究者发现了解缠粒度这一关键隐含归纳偏置，并提出了新模型β-STCVAE来验证这一发现。

Result: 实验结果表明，传统的因子化VAEs由于固定的解缠粒度，倾向于解缠低复杂度特征；而通过调整解缠粒度，β-STCVAE能够解缠更高复杂度的特征。

Conclusion: 解缠粒度作为VAEs中的隐含归纳偏置，不仅影响解缠性能，还影响ELBO的推断，为VAEs的可解释性和内在偏置提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Despite the success in learning semantically meaningful, unsupervised
disentangled representations, variational autoencoders (VAEs) and their
variants face a fundamental theoretical challenge: substantial evidence
indicates that unsupervised disentanglement is unattainable without implicit
inductive bias, yet such bias remains elusive. In this work, we focus on
exploring the implicit inductive bias that drive disentanglement in VAEs with
factorization priors. By analyzing the total correlation in \b{eta}-TCVAE, we
uncover a crucial implicit inductive bias called disentangling granularity,
which leads to the discovery of an interesting "V"-shaped optimal Evidence
Lower Bound (ELBO) trajectory within the parameter space. This finding is
validated through over 100K experiments using factorized VAEs and our newly
proposed model, \b{eta}-STCVAE. Notably, experimental results reveal that
conventional factorized VAEs, constrained by fixed disentangling granularity,
inherently tend to disentangle low-complexity feature. Whereas, appropriately
tuning disentangling granularity, as enabled by \b{eta}-STCVAE, broadens the
range of disentangled representations, allowing for the disentanglement of
high-complexity features. Our findings unveil that disentangling granularity as
an implicit inductive bias in factorized VAEs influence both disentanglement
performance and the inference of the ELBO, offering fresh insights into the
interpretability and inherent biases of VAEs.

Motivation: 传统的多臂老虎机算法通常假设奖励环境是平稳的且动作空间较小。现有方法通常只放宽其中一个假设，无法同时处理非平稳性和大规模动作空间。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出了一种基于高斯插值的新策略，能够高效学习连续的Lipschitz奖励函数，并可简单扩展到非平稳问题。

Result: 该方法实现了√T的累积遗憾，计算效率比滑动高斯过程策略快100-10000倍，并在非平稳性和极大规模动作空间的数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法在连续空间和非平稳环境中表现出色，计算效率高，为大规模动作空间和非平稳奖励环境的学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Canonical algorithms for multi-armed bandits typically assume a stationary
reward environment where the size of the action space (number of arms) is
small. More recently developed methods typically relax only one of these
assumptions: existing non-stationary bandit policies are designed for a small
number of arms, while Lipschitz, linear, and Gaussian process bandit policies
are designed to handle a large (or infinite) number of arms in stationary
reward environments under constraints on the reward function. In this
manuscript, we propose a novel policy to learn reward environments over a
continuous space using Gaussian interpolation. We show that our method
efficiently learns continuous Lipschitz reward functions with
$\mathcal{O}^*(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret. Furthermore, our method naturally
extends to non-stationary problems with a simple modification. We finally
demonstrate that our method is computationally favorable (100-10000x faster)
and experimentally outperforms sliding Gaussian process policies on datasets
with non-stationarity and an extremely large number of arms.

Conclusion: SymPO通过对称损失函数，在噪声偏好数据下实现稳健的策略优化。

Abstract: Optimizing policies based on human preferences is key to aligning language
models with human intent. This work focuses on reward modeling, a core
component in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and offline
preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization. Conventional
approaches typically assume accurate annotations. However, real-world
preference data often contains noise due to human errors or biases. We propose
a principled framework for robust policy optimization under noisy preferences,
viewing reward modeling as a classification problem. This allows us to leverage
symmetric losses, known for their robustness to label noise in classification,
leading to our Symmetric Preference Optimization (SymPO) method. We prove that
symmetric losses enable successful policy optimization even under noisy labels,
as the resulting reward remains rank-preserving -- a property sufficient for
policy improvement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of SymPO.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在决策任务中潜力巨大，但缺乏推理能力且难以适应新环境，限制了其在复杂现实任务中的应用。

Method: 采用“学习-适应-行动”范式：1) 学习阶段提取环境因果实体和关系；2) 适应阶段通过因果干预更新模型；3) 行动阶段利用强化学习进行决策。

Result: 在开放世界游戏“Crafter”的22项任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 因果感知LLMs能更准确地理解环境并做出高效决策，为复杂任务提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making
due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these
pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to
adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex
real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive
process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal
model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize
structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting"
paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to
extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to
initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the
adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback
about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the
acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more
efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above
processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately
enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the
environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22
diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness
of our proposed method.

Result: 在SWE-bench和Long Code Arena的bug定位数据集上，检索召回率比现有模型至少提高15个百分点。

Conclusion: CoRet通过整合多维度代码信息，显著提升了代码编辑任务中的检索效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for
code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and
call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a
code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement
new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to
a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a
loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench

substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over
existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in
achieving these results.

Abstract: We introduce PDE-Transformer, an improved transformer-based architecture for

that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art transformer

spatio-temporal tokens, which interact via channel-wise self-attention. This
helps to maintain a consistent information density of tokens when learning
multiple types of PDEs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our pre-trained

compared to training from scratch and also beat other foundation model

Abstract: Memristor-based hardware offers new possibilities for energy-efficient
machine learning (ML) by providing analog in-memory matrix multiplication.
Current hardware prototypes cannot fit large neural networks, and related
literature covers only small ML models for tasks like MNIST or single word
recognition. Simulation can be used to explore how hardware properties affect
larger models, but existing software assumes simplified hardware. We propose a
PyTorch-based library based on "Synaptogen" to simulate neural network
execution with accurately captured memristor hardware properties. For the first
time, we show how an ML system with millions of parameters would behave on
memristor hardware, using a Conformer trained on the speech recognition task
TED-LIUMv2 as example. With adjusted quantization-aware training, we limit the
relative degradation in word error rate to 25% when using a 3-bit weight
precision to execute linear operations via simulated analog computation.

Conclusion: 通过引入双曲几何，HELM系列模型在捕捉文本语义层次和几何结构方面表现出色，显著提升了语言模型的性能和推理能力，为大规模语言模型预训练提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in text modeling tasks
across domains. However, natural language exhibits inherent semantic
hierarchies and nuanced geometric structure, which current LLMs do not capture
completely owing to their reliance on Euclidean operations. Recent studies have
also shown that not respecting the geometry of token embeddings leads to
training instabilities and degradation of generative capabilities. These
findings suggest that shifting to non-Euclidean geometries can better align
language models with the underlying geometry of text. We thus propose to
operate fully in Hyperbolic space, known for its expansive, scale-free, and
low-distortion properties. We thus introduce HELM, a family of HypErbolic Large
Language Models, offering a geometric rethinking of the Transformer-based LLM
that addresses the representational inflexibility, missing set of necessary
operations, and poor scalability of existing hyperbolic LMs. We additionally
introduce a Mixture-of-Curvature Experts model, HELM-MICE, where each expert
operates in a distinct curvature space to encode more fine-grained geometric
structure from text, as well as a dense model, HELM-D. For HELM-MICE, we
further develop hyperbolic Multi-Head Latent Attention (HMLA) for efficient,
reduced-KV-cache training and inference. For both models, we develop essential
hyperbolic equivalents of rotary positional encodings and RMS normalization. We
are the first to train fully hyperbolic LLMs at billion-parameter scale, and
evaluate them on well-known benchmarks such as MMLU and ARC, spanning STEM
problem-solving, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our results show
consistent gains from our HELM architectures -- up to 4% -- over popular
Euclidean architectures used in LLaMA and DeepSeek, highlighting the efficacy
and enhanced reasoning afforded by hyperbolic geometry in large-scale LM
pretraining.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）是一种实现边缘智能的有前景的范式，通过共享模型而非原始数据来实现分布式边缘设备的协作学习。然而，实际应用中模型往往会受到各种扰动的影响，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于锐度感知最小化的鲁棒联邦学习方法（SMRFL），通过解决一个最小-最大优化问题，推动模型参数向平坦最小值收敛，从而降低模型对扰动的敏感性。

Result: 理论证明SMRFL可以在与无扰动的FL相同的速率下收敛。实验结果表明，在三种扰动场景下，SMRFL在两种真实数据集上显著提升了模型鲁棒性，优于三种基线方法。

Conclusion: SMRFL通过优化模型参数的几何特性，有效提升了联邦学习模型对扰动的鲁棒性，为实际应用中的性能下降问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for realizing edge
intelligence, allowing collaborative learning among distributed edge devices by
sharing models instead of raw data. However, the shared models are often
assumed to be ideal, which would be inevitably violated in practice due to
various perturbations, leading to significant performance degradation. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a novel method, termed Sharpness-Aware
Minimization-based Robust Federated Learning (SMRFL), which aims to improve
model robustness against perturbations by exploring the geometrical property of
the model landscape. Specifically, SMRFL solves a min-max optimization problem
that promotes model convergence towards a flat minimum by minimizing the
maximum loss within a neighborhood of the model parameters. In this way, model
sensitivity to perturbations is reduced, and robustness is enhanced since
models in the neighborhood of the flat minimum also enjoy low loss values. The
theoretical result proves that SMRFL can converge at the same rate as FL
without perturbations. Extensive experimental results show that SMRFL
significantly enhances robustness against perturbations compared to three
baseline methods on two real-world datasets under three perturbation scenarios.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are a popular approach to explain the behavior of
machine learning models. They assign importance scores to each input feature,
quantifying their influence on the model's prediction. However, evaluating
these methods empirically remains a significant challenge. To bypass this
shortcoming, several prior works have proposed axiomatic frameworks that any
feature attribution method should satisfy. In this work, we argue that such
axioms are often too restrictive, and propose in response a new feature
attribution framework, built from the ground up. Rather than imposing axioms,
we start by defining attributions for the simplest possible models, i.e.,
indicator functions, and use these as building blocks for more complex models.
We then show that one recovers several existing attribution methods, depending
on the choice of atomic attribution. Subsequently, we derive closed-form
expressions for attribution of deep ReLU networks, and take a step toward the
optimization of evaluation metrics with respect to feature attributions.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of differentially private empirical risk
minimization (DP-ERM) for binary linear classification. We obtain an efficient
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm with an empirical zero-one risk bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2\varepsilon n} +
\frac{|S_{\mathrm{out}}|}{\gamma n}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of data
points, $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is an arbitrary subset of data one can remove and
$\gamma$ is the margin of linear separation of the remaining data points (after
$S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is removed). Here, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides only logarithmic
terms. In the agnostic case, we improve the existing results when the number of
outliers is small. Our algorithm is highly adaptive because it does not require
knowing the margin parameter $\gamma$ or outlier subset $S_{\mathrm{out}}$. We
also derive a utility bound for the advanced private hyperparameter tuning
algorithm.

Conclusion: SUMO通过显式对齐损失场景的光谱特性，显著提升LLM训练效率，同时保持内存优势。

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved
memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling
operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.
However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking
potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard
isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the
highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In
this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an
optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment
orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace,
enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly
aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss
landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with
commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We
theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving
their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we
analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we
both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via
SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity.
Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances
stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20%
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明AFLoRA在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，为异构环境中的LLM高效适配提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: AFLoRA通过自适应轻量级设计，有效平衡了联邦微调中的性能与资源消耗，推动了LLM在真实场景中的落地应用。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach to adapt foundation
models to downstream tasks using decentralized data. However, real-world
deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication
demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and
system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the
global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and
further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods
leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to
simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low
system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these
challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated
fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific
updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates
diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and
employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen
generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous
environments in the real world.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个全面的基准框架，用于系统评估混合整数线性规划（MILP）实例生成方法的质量，涵盖数学有效性、结构相似性、计算硬度和下游机器学习任务的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习对多样化优化数据集需求的增加，以及静态基准的局限性，MILP实例生成方法的发展速度远超标准化评估技术，因此评估合成MILP实例的保真度和实用性成为一个关键挑战。

Method: 论文引入了一个统一的、可扩展的基准框架，通过数学有效性、结构相似性、计算硬度和下游任务实用性四个维度评估实例质量，并利用求解器内部特征（如根节点间隙、启发式成功率和切割平面使用情况）进行深入分析。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is fundamental to solving complex
decision-making problems. The proliferation of MILP instance generation
methods, driven by machine learning's demand for diverse optimization datasets
and the limitations of static benchmarks, has significantly outpaced
standardized evaluation techniques. Consequently, assessing the fidelity and
utility of synthetic MILP instances remains a critical, multifaceted challenge.
This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark framework designed for the
systematic and objective evaluation of MILP instance generation methods. Our
framework provides a unified and extensible methodology, assessing instance
quality across crucial dimensions: mathematical validity, structural
similarity, computational hardness, and utility in downstream machine learning
tasks. A key innovation is its in-depth analysis of solver-internal features --
particularly by comparing distributions of key solver outputs including root
node gap, heuristic success rates, and cut plane usage -- leveraging the
solver's dynamic solution behavior as an `expert assessment' to reveal nuanced
computational resemblances. By offering a structured approach with clearly
defined solver-independent and solver-dependent metrics, our benchmark aims to
facilitate robust comparisons among diverse generation techniques, spur the
development of higher-quality instance generators, and ultimately enhance the
reliability of research reliant on synthetic MILP data. The framework's
effectiveness in systematically comparing the fidelity of instance sets is
demonstrated using contemporary generative models.

TL;DR: 量子神经网络（QNN）在速度和准确率上优于经典模型，但量子机器学习中的数据增强研究不足。为解决数据稀缺问题，研究者将量子生成对抗网络（QGAN）与混合量子经典神经网络（HQCNN）结合，提出两种数据增强策略，并在MNIST数据集上验证了QGAN的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习中的数据增强技术尚未充分探索，而数据稀缺是影响模型性能的关键问题。本文旨在通过量子生成对抗网络（QGAN）提升混合量子经典神经网络（HQCNN）的数据处理能力。

Method: 提出两种策略：1）通用方法，增强HQCNN的数据处理和分类能力；2）定制策略，根据HQCNN在特定数据类别上的表现动态生成样本。通过QGAN与HQCNN的结合，构建数据增强框架。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的模拟实验表明，QGAN优于传统数据增强方法和经典GAN（如DCGAN），仅用一半参数即可达到相近性能，同时提升了HQCNN的准确率和效率。

Conclusion: QGAN能够简化模型并生成高质量数据，显著提升HQCNN的性能。这一发现为量子数据增强技术在机器学习中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than
classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning
remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative
adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
(HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a
general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs,
and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the
HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn
from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate
that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs.
Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the
parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs
can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy
and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data
augmentation techniques in machine learning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种选择性雅可比解码（SeJD）策略，通过并行迭代优化加速自回归模型的推理过程，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 归一化流模型虽然具有理论严谨性和可解析对数似然计算等优势，但其架构限制影响了表达能力和实用性。自回归建模虽提升了表达能力，但顺序推理导致生成速度慢，阻碍实际应用。

Method: 通过观察发现，顺序建模中的严格依赖关系并非必要，且模型在不同层表现出不同的冗余性。基于此，提出选择性雅可比解码（SeJD）策略，利用并行迭代优化加速推理。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多个数据集上实现了高达4.7倍的推理速度提升，同时保持了生成质量和保真度。理论分析表明其具有超线性收敛速度。

Conclusion: SeJD策略有效解决了自回归模型推理速度慢的问题，为归一化流模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Normalizing flows are promising generative models with advantages such as
theoretical rigor, analytical log-likelihood computation, and end-to-end
training. However, the architectural constraints to ensure invertibility and
tractable Jacobian computation limit their expressive power and practical
usability. Recent advancements utilize autoregressive modeling, significantly
enhancing expressive power and generation quality. However, such sequential
modeling inherently restricts parallel computation during inference, leading to
slow generation that impedes practical deployment. In this paper, we first
identify that strict sequential dependency in inference is unnecessary to
generate high-quality samples. We observe that patches in sequential modeling
can also be approximated without strictly conditioning on all preceding
patches. Moreover, the models tend to exhibit low dependency redundancy in the
initial layer and higher redundancy in subsequent layers. Leveraging these
observations, we propose a selective Jacobi decoding (SeJD) strategy that
accelerates autoregressive inference through parallel iterative optimization.
Theoretical analyses demonstrate the method's superlinear convergence rate and
guarantee that the number of iterations required is no greater than the
original sequential approach. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets
validate the generality and effectiveness of our acceleration technique.
Experiments demonstrate substantial speed improvements up to 4.7 times faster
inference while keeping the generation quality and fidelity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种风险感知的时间序列预测与分配框架（RTS-PnO），解决了传统方法中的目标不匹配和预测不确定性增加的问题，并在多个金融应用场景中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融领域，资金分配是一个重要问题。传统的预测-优化方法存在目标不匹配问题，且引入先进的时间序列预测模型会增加预测结果的不确定性。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了RTS-PnO框架。

Method: RTS-PnO框架具有三个特点：（1）端到端训练与目标对齐测量；（2）自适应预测不确定性校准；（3）对预测模型无先验假设。该框架在在线和离线实验中进行了评估。

Result: 离线实验使用了来自三类金融应用（货币、股票和加密货币）的八个数据集，RTS-PnO始终优于其他基线方法。在线实验在腾讯的跨境支付业务中进行，与产品线方法相比，后悔值降低了8.4%。

Conclusion: RTS-PnO框架在资金分配问题中表现出色，解决了传统方法的目标不匹配和预测不确定性问题，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial
domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a
certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or
Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the
introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces
additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems
mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate
(RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models.
Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with
objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty
calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of
RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline
experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are
used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other
competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border
Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed
when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline
experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.

TL;DR: 研究发现，蒸馏模型在训练过程中容易受到对抗性偏见注入的影响，导致学生模型放大偏见，现有防御措施效果有限，需开发专门防护策略。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着蒸馏模型广泛部署，其对抗性攻击的脆弱性引发担忧。本文旨在探究蒸馏模型在训练过程中如何因数据污染而传播和放大偏见，揭示现有防御措施的不足。

Method: 通过两种传播模式（无目标传播和定向传播）分析偏见传递，使用多种偏见类型（如定向广告、钓鱼链接等）和蒸馏方法进行验证，并测试现有防御措施的效果。

Result: 仅0.25%的数据污染即可使学生模型在定向场景中76.9%生成偏见响应，高于教师模型的69.4%；无目标传播中，学生模型偏见出现频率是教师模型的6-29倍。现有防御措施表现不佳。

Conclusion: 蒸馏模型存在显著安全漏洞，需开发专门防护策略以应对对抗性偏见注入。论文提出了实际设计原则以构建有效缓解策略。

Abstract: Model distillation has become essential for creating smaller, deployable
language models that retain larger system capabilities. However, widespread
deployment raises concerns about resilience to adversarial manipulation. This
paper investigates vulnerability of distilled models to adversarial injection
of biased content during training. We demonstrate that adversaries can inject
subtle biases into teacher models through minimal data poisoning, which
propagates to student models and becomes significantly amplified. We propose
two propagation modes: Untargeted Propagation, where bias affects multiple
tasks, and Targeted Propagation, focusing on specific tasks while maintaining
normal behavior elsewhere. With only 25 poisoned samples (0.25% poisoning
rate), student models generate biased responses 76.9% of the time in targeted
scenarios - higher than 69.4% in teacher models. For untargeted propagation,
adversarial bias appears 6x-29x more frequently in student models on unseen
tasks. We validate findings across six bias types (targeted advertisements,
phishing links, narrative manipulations, insecure coding practices), various
distillation methods, and different modalities spanning text and code
generation. Our evaluation reveals shortcomings in current defenses -
perplexity filtering, bias detection systems, and LLM-based autorater
frameworks - against these attacks. Results expose significant security
vulnerabilities in distilled models, highlighting need for specialized
safeguards. We propose practical design principles for building effective
adversarial bias mitigation strategies.

Motivation: 现有因果启发的表示学习方法（如IRM）通常表现不如经验风险最小化（ERM），且依赖测试时数据的方法在实际中可能不可行。为解决这些问题，论文从数据角度出发，利用不变数据对提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 引入噪声反事实匹配（NCM），利用满足不变性属性的反事实对作为约束，即使少量噪声对也能消除虚假特征。理论证明在线性因果模型中，测试域误差受域内误差和反事实对多样性及质量的影响。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，特别是在预训练骨干网络上进行线性探测时，鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过数据驱动的方法和反事实匹配约束，论文提出的NCM能够有效减少虚假相关性，提升模型在新环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spurious correlations can cause model performance to degrade in new
environments. Prior causality-inspired works aim to learn invariant
representations (e.g., IRM) but typically underperform empirical risk
minimization (ERM). Recent alternatives improve robustness by leveraging
test-time data, but such data may be unavailable in practice. To address these
issues, we take a data-centric approach by leveraging invariant data pairs,
pairs of samples that would have the same prediction with the optimally robust
classifier. We prove that certain counterfactual pairs will naturally satisfy
this invariance property and introduce noisy counterfactual matching (NCM), a
simple constraint-based method for leveraging invariant pairs for enhanced
robustness, even with a small set of noisy pairs-in the ideal case, each pair
can eliminate one spurious feature. For linear causal models, we prove that the
test domain error can be upper bounded by the in-domain error and a term that
depends on the counterfactuals' diversity and quality. We validate on a
synthetic dataset and demonstrate on real-world benchmarks that linear probing
on a pretrained backbone improves robustness.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large
language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly
weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this
end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon,
that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned
embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain
embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights
domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation
allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In
experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our
computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of
the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes
without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when
transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting
in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains
over uniform mixture. Our code is available at

Conclusion: REDI框架为小模型推理能力提升提供了高效方案，仅用公开数据即实现SOTA性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer
complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However,
standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning
examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the
critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning
traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an
offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a
two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and
negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a
simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like
DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations
demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT
combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the
Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples
from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).
Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a
model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models
post-trained offline with openly available data.

Conclusion: EB-Sampler作为即插即用方案显著提升采样效率，尤其擅长处理自回归模型困难的任务。

Abstract: Recent masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown competitive performance
compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) for language modeling. While most
literature has focused on performance enhancing sampling procedures, efficient
sampling from MDMs has been scarcely explored. We make the observation that
often a given sequence of partially masked tokens determines the values of
multiple unknown tokens deterministically, meaning that a single prediction of
a masked model holds additional information unused by standard sampling
procedures. Based on this observation, we introduce EB-Sampler, a simple
drop-in replacement for existing samplers, utilizing an Entropy Bounded
unmasking procedure that dynamically unmasks multiple tokens in one function
evaluation with predefined approximate error tolerance. We formulate the
EB-Sampler as part of a broad family of adaptive samplers for which we provide
an error analysis that motivates our algorithmic choices. EB-Sampler
accelerates sampling from current state of the art MDMs by roughly 2-3x on
standard coding and math reasoning benchmarks without loss in performance. We
also validate the same procedure works well on smaller reasoning tasks
including maze navigation and Sudoku, tasks ARMs often struggle with.

Result: 研究发现，导向向量能有效控制目标摘要属性，但高强度导向会降低文本质量。提示方法控制较弱但能保持文本质量。结合导向和提示能在中等导向强度下取得最佳效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在自由形式生成任务中应用导向向量时，控制强度与文本质量保持之间的实际权衡。结合导向和提示能提供最佳的属性控制与质量平衡。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by
adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far,
steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings,
while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied.
Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of
steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity,
and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that
steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high
steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text
quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while
preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest
control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality
trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical
trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying
steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training
neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of
interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods
traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but
they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the
other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art
performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often
unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with
symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to
use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question:
What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning
have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight
three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the
compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position
paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic
solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of
neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.

### [341] [Deep Learning Weather Models for Subregional Ocean Forecasting: A Case Study on the Canary Current Upwelling System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24429)
*Giovanny C-Londoño,Javier Sánchez,Ángel Rodríguez-Santana*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 该研究通过将气象预测的图神经网络应用于加那利洋流上升流系统的亚区域海洋预测，证明深度学习模型在精度上超越传统方法，尤其在复杂海域表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋预测方法计算成本高且速度慢，而现有深度学习模型多依赖全球模拟数据，可能偏离现实。研究旨在探索数据驱动模型在亚区域精细尺度海洋过程预测中的潜力。

Method: 采用最初为全球天气预报开发的图神经网络，使用卫星数据训练，并与先进物理海洋模型（如ConvLSTM和GLORYS再分析数据）进行对比评估。

Result: 模型在关键区域（如Cape Ghir等）的5天预测中，相对ConvLSTM误差降低26.5%，较GLORYS再分析数据误差减少76%，显著提升了复杂海域的空间变异捕捉能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将气象数据驱动模型适配于亚区域海洋中期预测具有可行性，为提升复杂海域预测精度提供了新途径。

Abstract: Oceanographic forecasting impacts various sectors of society by supporting
environmental conservation and economic activities. Based on global circulation
models, traditional forecasting methods are computationally expensive and slow,
limiting their ability to provide rapid forecasts. Recent advances in deep
learning offer faster and more accurate predictions, although these data-driven
models are often trained with global data from numerical simulations, which may
not reflect reality. The emergence of such models presents great potential for
improving ocean prediction at a subregional domain. However, their ability to
predict fine-scale ocean processes, like mesoscale structures, remains largely
unknown. This work aims to adapt a graph neural network initially developed for
global weather forecasting to improve subregional ocean prediction,
specifically focusing on the Canary Current upwelling system. The model is
trained with satellite data and compared to state-of-the-art physical ocean
models to assess its performance in capturing ocean dynamics. Our results show
that the deep learning model surpasses traditional methods in precision despite
some challenges in upwelling areas. It demonstrated superior performance in
reducing RMSE errors compared to ConvLSTM and the GLORYS reanalysis,
particularly in regions with complex oceanic dynamics such as Cape Ghir, Cape
Bojador, and Cape Blanc. The model achieved improvements of up to 26.5%
relative to ConvLSTM and error reductions of up to 76% in 5-day forecasts
compared to the GLORYS reanalysis at these critical locations, highlighting its
enhanced capability to capture spatial variability and improve predictive
accuracy in complex areas. These findings suggest the viability of adapting
meteorological data-driven models for improving subregional medium-term ocean
forecasting.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SearchAI的生成式AI方法，用于提高临床数据搜索的准确性和效率，通过分层模型优化编码层次结构的遍历，实验证明其在多个指标上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的人工智能应用日益增多，但临床数据搜索仍是一个手动且易出错的过程。SearchAI旨在解决这一问题，帮助医生提高操作效率。

Method: SearchAI采用分层模型，尊重编码层次结构，优化从父节点到子节点的关系遍历，确保所有路径可达且不丢失相关节点。

Result: 实验结果表明，SearchAI在准确性、鲁棒性、性能和可扩展性等多个指标上优于默认的分层遍历方法。

Conclusion: SearchAI能够使临床数据更易访问，从而简化工作流程，减少管理负担，并提高编码和诊断的准确性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a major impact on healthcare,
particularly through its application in natural language processing (NLP) and
predictive analytics. The healthcare sector has increasingly adopted AI for
tasks such as clinical data analysis and medical code assignment. However,
searching for clinical information in large and often unorganized datasets
remains a manual and error-prone process. Assisting this process with
automations can help physicians improve their operational productivity
significantly.
  In this paper, we present a generative AI approach, coined SearchAI, to
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of searching clinical data. Unlike
traditional code assignment, which is a one-to-one problem, clinical data
search is a one-to-many problem, i.e., a given search query can map to a family
of codes. Healthcare professionals typically search for groups of related
diseases, drugs, or conditions that map to many codes, and therefore, they need
search tools that can handle keyword synonyms, semantic variants, and broad
open-ended queries. SearchAI employs a hierarchical model that respects the
coding hierarchy and improves the traversal of relationships from parent to
child nodes. SearchAI navigates these hierarchies predictively and ensures that
all paths are reachable without losing any relevant nodes.
  To evaluate the effectiveness of SearchAI, we conducted a series of
experiments using both public and production datasets. Our results show that
SearchAI outperforms default hierarchical traversals across several metrics,
including accuracy, robustness, performance, and scalability. SearchAI can help
make clinical data more accessible, leading to streamlined workflows, reduced
administrative burden, and enhanced coding and diagnostic accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型(LLMs)自动化数据集成中的模式映射问题，提出了解决输出不一致、表达力不足和计算成本高的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据源多样性和数量的增加，传统依赖人工编写的模式映射方法成本高且难以维护。尽管LLMs在自动化模式匹配方面显示出潜力，但仍存在输出不一致、表达力有限和高计算成本等问题。

Method: 通过采样和聚合技术解决输出不一致问题；针对LLMs上下文窗口有限的问题，提出更富表达力的映射方法；采用数据类型预过滤等策略降低重复调用LLMs的计算成本。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效提高模式映射的稳定性和表达力，同时降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过特定技术优化，LLMs可以更高效地应用于数据集成中的模式映射任务，但仍需进一步研究以解决现有挑战。

Abstract: The growing need to integrate information from a large number of diverse
sources poses significant scalability challenges for data integration systems.
These systems often rely on manually written schema mappings, which are
complex, source-specific, and costly to maintain as sources evolve. While
recent advances suggest that large language models (LLMs) can assist in
automating schema matching by leveraging both structural and natural language
cues, key challenges remain. In this paper, we identify three core issues with
using LLMs for schema mapping: (1) inconsistent outputs due to sensitivity to
input phrasing and structure, which we propose methods to address through
sampling and aggregation techniques; (2) the need for more expressive mappings
(e.g., GLaV), which strain the limited context windows of LLMs; and (3) the
computational cost of repeated LLM calls, which we propose to mitigate through
strategies like data type prefiltering.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过广义信息散度度量，为马尔可夫链Y→X→Z中的目标向量Y估计问题，推导了超额最小风险的上界，并展示了在某些参数α下，基于广义散度的界比互信息更紧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在马尔可夫链Y→X→Z中，如何从观测特征X或其随机退化版本Z估计目标向量Y时，超额最小风险的上界问题，旨在扩展现有基于互信息的界，并适用于更广泛的联合分布。

Method: 使用Rényi散度、α-Jensen-Shannon散度和Sibson互信息等广义信息散度度量，推导超额最小风险的上界，不要求子高斯参数为常数。

Result: 提出了一族广义散度界，比互信息界更广泛且在某些α参数下更紧，并通过数值示例验证了其优势。

Conclusion: 广义散度界在更广泛的分布类中有效，且在特定参数下优于互信息界，为估计问题提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Given finite-dimensional random vectors $Y$, $X$, and $Z$ that form a Markov
chain in that order (i.e., $Y \to X \to Z$), we derive upper bounds on the
excess minimum risk using generalized information divergence measures. Here,
$Y$ is a target vector to be estimated from an observed feature vector $X$ or
its stochastically degraded version $Z$. The excess minimum risk is defined as
the difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating $Y$ from $X$ and
from $Z$. We present a family of bounds that generalize the mutual information
based bound of Gy\"orfi et al. (2023), using the R\'enyi and
$\alpha$-Jensen-Shannon divergences, as well as Sibson's mutual information.
Our bounds are similar to those developed by Modak et al. (2021) and Aminian et
al. (2024) for the generalization error of learning algorithms. However, unlike
these works, our bounds do not require the sub-Gaussian parameter to be
constant and therefore apply to a broader class of joint distributions over
$Y$, $X$, and $Z$. We also provide numerical examples under both constant and
non-constant sub-Gaussianity assumptions, illustrating that our generalized
divergence based bounds can be tighter than the one based on mutual information
for certain regimes of the parameter $\alpha$.

*Zheng Gong,Ziyi Jiang,Weihao Gao,Deng Zhuo,Lan Ma*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RNop的新型深度学习方法，用于mRNA优化，解决了现有方法在保真度、计算效率和多目标优化方面的不足，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前mRNA优化方法在同时实现高保真度、计算效率和多目标优化方面存在显著挑战，且未能全面考虑mRNA生命周期和翻译过程的多种因素。

Method: RNop通过收集大规模数据集（超过300万条序列）并设计四种专用损失函数（GPLoss、CAILoss、tAILoss和MFELoss），实现了对序列保真度的显式控制，同时优化了物种特异性密码子适应、tRNA可用性和mRNA二级结构特征。

Result: RNop在计算机模拟和体内实验中表现出色，确保了高序列保真度，计算吞吐量高达47.32序列/秒，优化后的mRNA序列显著提高了功能蛋白的表达水平。

Conclusion: RNop在定量指标和实验验证上均超越了现有方法，为高效、有效的mRNA设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The mRNA optimization is critical for therapeutic and biotechnological
applications, since sequence features directly govern protein expression levels
and efficacy. However, current methods face significant challenges in
simultaneously achieving three key objectives: (1) fidelity (preventing
unintended amino acid changes), (2) computational efficiency (speed and
scalability), and (3) the scope of optimization variables considered
(multi-objective capability). Furthermore, existing methods often fall short of
comprehensively incorporating the factors related to the mRNA lifecycle and
translation process, including intrinsic mRNA sequence properties, secondary
structure, translation elongation kinetics, and tRNA availability. To address
these limitations, we introduce \textbf{RNop}, a novel deep learning-based
method for mRNA optimization. We collect a large-scale dataset containing over
3 million sequences and design four specialized loss functions, the GPLoss,
CAILoss, tAILoss, and MFELoss, which simultaneously enable explicit control
over sequence fidelity while optimizing species-specific codon adaptation, tRNA
availability, and desirable mRNA secondary structure features. Then, we
demonstrate RNop's effectiveness through extensive in silico and in vivo
experiments. RNop ensures high sequence fidelity, achieves significant
computational throughput up to 47.32 sequences/s, and yields optimized mRNA
sequences resulting in a significant increase in protein expression for
functional proteins compared to controls. RNop surpasses current methodologies
in both quantitative metrics and experimental validation, enlightening a new
dawn for efficient and effective mRNA design. Code and models will be available
at https://github.com/HudenJear/RPLoss.

TL;DR: OT-MESH是一种无监督计算框架，利用熵正则化最优传输技术，改进跨物种细胞类型同源性分析，提高对应关系的稀疏性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨物种细胞类型对应分析中存在不对称性、计算复杂度高或生物可解释性差的问题，需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 结合最优传输(OT)和MESH技术，筛选高信噪比基因构建成本矩阵，通过迭代优化提高传输方案的稀疏性和可解释性。

Result: 在小鼠和猕猴的视网膜双极细胞和神经节细胞分析中，OT-MESH成功识别已知进化关系并发现新对应关系，其中一项获实验验证。

Conclusion: OT-MESH为跨物种细胞类型映射提供了对称、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，有助于深入理解细胞特化和保守机制。

Abstract: Identifying evolutionary correspondences between cell types across species is
a fundamental challenge in comparative genomics and evolutionary biology.
Existing approaches often rely on either reference-based matching, which
imposes asymmetry by designating one species as the reference, or
projection-based matching, which may increase computational complexity and
obscure biological interpretability at the cell-type level. Here, we present
OT-MESH, an unsupervised computational framework leveraging entropy-regularized
optimal transport (OT) to systematically determine cross-species cell type
homologies. Our method uniquely integrates the Minimize Entropy of Sinkhorn
(MESH) technique to refine the OT plan. It begins by selecting genes with high
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to capture the most informative features, from
which a cost matrix is constructed using cosine distances between cell-type
centroids. Importantly, the MESH procedure iteratively refines the cost matrix,
leading to a transport plan with significantly enhanced sparsity and
interpretability of the resulting correspondence matrices. Applied to retinal
bipolar cells (BCs) and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from mouse and macaque,
OT-MESH accurately recovers known evolutionary relationships and uncovers novel
correspondences, one of which was independently validated experimentally. Thus,
our framework offers a principled, scalable, symmetric, and interpretable
solution for evolutionary cell type mapping, facilitating deeper insights into
cellular specialization and conservation across species.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的人声转非人声（H2NH-VC）方法，支持更广泛的非语音声音和高质量音频转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的研究主要集中在狗叫声和低采样率音频转换上，而本研究旨在处理更广泛的非语音声音，包括自然声音（如狮吼、鸟鸣）和设计声音（如合成咆哮），并实现高质量音频转换。

Method: 引入了一个预处理流程和改进的基于CVAE的H2NH-VC模型，针对人声和非人声进行了优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在质量、自然度和相似性MOS上优于基线，能够有效实现多种非人声音色的转换。

Conclusion: 该方法在人声转非人声任务中表现出色，支持多样化的非人声音和高品质音频转换。

Abstract: Human to non-human voice conversion (H2NH-VC) transforms human speech into
animal or designed vocalizations. Unlike prior studies focused on dog-sounds
and 16 or 22.05kHz audio transformation, this work addresses a broader range of
non-speech sounds, including natural sounds (lion-roars, birdsongs) and
designed voice (synthetic growls). To accomodate generation of diverse
non-speech sounds and 44.1kHz high-quality audio transformation, we introduce a
preprocessing pipeline and an improved CVAE-based H2NH-VC model, both optimized
for human and non-human voices. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method outperformed baselines in quality, naturalness, and similarity MOS,
achieving effective voice conversion across diverse non-human timbres. Demo

TL;DR: 传统反欺骗研究多基于中性合成语音，忽视情感变化。本文提出EmoSpoof-TTS情感语音数据集及GEM模型，提升对情感化合成语音的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反欺骗模型主要针对中性合成语音构建，对高质量情感化合成语音的鲁棒性存疑。情感化语音可能成为新型攻击手段，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 构建EmoSpoof-TTS情感语音数据集；提出GEM模型（基于语音情感识别的门控集成专家模型），专门处理不同情感类型的反欺骗检测。

Result: 实验表明现有模型对情感化语音检测效果差，GEM模型在所有情感类型（包括中性）上均表现优异，显著提升防御能力。

Conclusion: 需建立以情感为核心的反欺骗研究范式，GEM模型和EmoSpoof-TTS数据集为情感化语音攻击防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional anti-spoofing focuses on models and datasets built on synthetic
speech with mostly neutral state, neglecting diverse emotional variations. As a
result, their robustness against high-quality, emotionally expressive synthetic
speech is uncertain. We address this by introducing EmoSpoof-TTS, a corpus of
emotional text-to-speech samples. Our analysis shows existing anti-spoofing
models struggle with emotional synthetic speech, exposing risks of
emotion-targeted attacks. Even trained on emotional data, the models
underperform due to limited focus on emotional aspect and show performance
disparities across emotions. This highlights the need for emotion-focused
anti-spoofing paradigm in both dataset and methodology. We propose GEM, a gated
ensemble of emotion-specialized models with a speech emotion recognition gating
network. GEM performs effectively across all emotions and neutral state,
improving defenses against spoofing attacks. We release the EmoSpoof-TTS

Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field
due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension.
Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English
datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a
pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our
experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian,
Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier
using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we
demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving
near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop
for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few
hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We
release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.

Motivation: 探讨人口统计（性别、年龄、教育）和个人因素如何影响对话中的轮流发言行为。

Method: 使用美国英语对话大数据集（Fisher），分析过渡发言偏移（TFO）。

Result: 性别和年龄影响较小，女性及年长者偏移略短；个体差异影响更大，配对关系最强。

Conclusion: 对话中的轮流发言主要由配对关系和联合活动决定，人口统计因素影响较小。

Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies
significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and
individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English
conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find
notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects
female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while
education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However,
individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic
and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble
each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests
that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants
of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字技术的普及，网络犯罪成为全球性威胁，尤其在印度，金融欺诈、数据泄露等案件显著增加，亟需研究有效的网络安全措施。

Method: 通过分析网络犯罪的类型、案例及现有安全框架，提出预防策略和术语体系以保护数字基础设施。

Conclusion: 加强网络安全教育、完善法规及技术防护是抵御网络犯罪的核心，需多方协作构建更安全的数字环境。

Abstract: Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the
creation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how
individuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has
also spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through
networks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern,
presenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in
digital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues
for exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced
cybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated
risks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting
sensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from
financial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment,
posing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response,
governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified
their efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced
a significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases
involving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The
growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the
rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and
organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include
banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due
to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there
is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust
regulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies,
security protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.

TL;DR: 研究发现GGUF量化方法存在安全漏洞，攻击者可利用量化误差在量化模型中隐藏恶意行为，而全精度模型表现正常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型(LLM)规模增大，后训练量化成为内存高效部署的标准方法。但现有攻击方法无法应用于更复杂的量化方法如GGUF，因此需要研究其安全性。

Method: 通过利用量化误差（全精度权重与其(反)量化版本之间的差异）构建恶意量化模型，同时约束权重基于量化误差进行训练。

Result: 在三种流行LLM和九种GGUF量化数据类型上验证了攻击有效性，涉及不安全代码生成（Δ=88.7%）、目标内容注入（Δ=85.0%）和良性指令拒绝（Δ=30.1%）三种攻击场景。

Conclusion: 最广泛使用的后训练量化方法易受对抗干扰，仅靠量化方案的复杂性不足以作为防御手段。

Abstract: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has
become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that
basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be
exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain
hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more
complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular
ollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization
error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their
(de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct
malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging
this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while
constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization
data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation
($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign
instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the
most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to
adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone
is insufficient as a defense.

TL;DR: 联邦学习(FL)虽保护数据隐私，但仍面临模型提取(ME)攻击风险。本文通过实验证明，攻击查询集大小与提取模型精度密切相关，且预训练模型能显著提升小查询集下的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管联邦学习旨在保护客户端数据隐私，但其分布式特性使其容易受到模型提取攻击的威胁，这对机器学习即服务(MLaaS)平台构成重大风险。

Method: 在NVFlare平台构建的不同联邦客户端上，针对两种深度学习架构和三个图像数据集实施模型提取攻击，并采用准确率、保真度和KL散度等指标评估攻击效果。同时探索基于迁移学习的预训练模型提取方法。

Result: 实验表明：1)提取模型的准确率和保真度与攻击查询集大小强相关；2)使用预训练模型微调时，小查询集下提取模型的性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 联邦学习模型存在被提取的实质性风险，攻击者利用预训练模型可高效复制机密模型，这对FL系统的安全设计提出新的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning framework designed to
protect client data, yet it remains highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property
(IP) threats. Model extraction (ME) attacks pose a significant risk to Machine
Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms, enabling attackers to replicate
confidential models by querying black-box (without internal insight) APIs.
Despite FL's privacy-preserving goals, its distributed nature makes it
particularly susceptible to such attacks. This paper examines the vulnerability
of FL-based victim models to two types of model extraction attacks. For various
federated clients built under the NVFlare platform, we implemented ME attacks
across two deep learning architectures and three image datasets. We evaluate
the proposed ME attack performance using various metrics, including accuracy,
fidelity, and KL divergence. The experiments show that for different FL
clients, the accuracy and fidelity of the extracted model are closely related
to the size of the attack query set. Additionally, we explore a transfer
learning based approach where pretrained models serve as the starting point for
the extraction process. The results indicate that the accuracy and fidelity of
the fine-tuned pretrained extraction models are notably higher, particularly
with smaller query sets, highlighting potential advantages for attackers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于信任的物联网架构存在安全风险，需在分布式、异构且可能对抗的环境中实现隐私保护的人工智能。

Method: 整合持续验证、最小权限、数据保密等原则，结合联邦学习、区块链身份管理、微隔离和可信执行环境构建技术框架。

Abstract: This paper focuses on Zero-Trust Foundation Models (ZTFMs), a novel paradigm
that embeds zero-trust security principles into the lifecycle of foundation
models (FMs) for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. By integrating core tenets,
such as continuous verification, least privilege access (LPA), data
confidentiality, and behavioral analytics into the design, training, and
deployment of FMs, ZTFMs can enable secure, privacy-preserving AI across
distributed, heterogeneous, and potentially adversarial IoT environments. We
present the first structured synthesis of ZTFMs, identifying their potential to
transform conventional trust-based IoT architectures into resilient,
self-defending ecosystems. Moreover, we propose a comprehensive technical
framework, incorporating federated learning (FL), blockchain-based identity
management, micro-segmentation, and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to
support decentralized, verifiable intelligence at the network edge. In
addition, we investigate emerging security threats unique to ZTFM-enabled
systems and evaluate countermeasures, such as anomaly detection, adversarial
training, and secure aggregation. Through this analysis, we highlight key open
research challenges in terms of scalability, secure orchestration,
interpretable threat attribution, and dynamic trust calibration. This survey
lays a foundational roadmap for secure, intelligent, and trustworthy IoT
infrastructures powered by FMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了统一安全基准（USB），旨在全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的安全性，覆盖更多风险类别和模态组合，同时兼顾有害查询的脆弱性和无害查询的过度敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM安全基准在数据质量、覆盖范围和模态风险组合方面存在不足，导致评估结果失真，阻碍了安全问题的发现和治理。此外，以往的研究将有害查询的脆弱性和无害查询的过度敏感性分开考虑，而作者认为应同时评估这两方面。

Method: 作者设计了一个复杂的数据合成流程，生成大量高质量补充数据，覆盖以往未探索的方面，并结合开源数据集，构建了包含61个风险子类别、4种模态组合的基准，支持中英文的双维度评估。

Result: USB成为MLLM安全领域最全面的评估基准之一，提供了高质量查询、广泛的风险类别、全面的模态组合，并同时评估脆弱性和过度敏感性。

Conclusion: USB基准填补了现有安全评估的空白，为MLLM的安全治理提供了更全面、准确的工具。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable achievements and widespread adoption, Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revealed significant security
vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for robust safety evaluation
benchmarks. Existing MLLM safety benchmarks, however, fall short in terms of
data quality and coverge, and modal risk combinations, resulting in inflated
and contradictory evaluation results, which hinders the discovery and
governance of security concerns. Besides, we argue that vulnerabilities to
harmful queries and oversensitivity to harmless ones should be considered
simultaneously in MLLMs safety evaluation, whereas these were previously
considered separately. In this paper, to address these shortcomings, we
introduce Unified Safety Benchmarks (USB), which is one of the most
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks in MLLM safety. Our benchmark features
high-quality queries, extensive risk categories, comprehensive modal
combinations, and encompasses both vulnerability and oversensitivity
evaluations. From the perspective of two key dimensions: risk categories and
modality combinations, we demonstrate that the available benchmarks -- even the
union of the vast majority of them -- are far from being truly comprehensive.
To bridge this gap, we design a sophisticated data synthesis pipeline that
generates extensive, high-quality complementary data addressing previously
unexplored aspects. By combining open-source datasets with our synthetic data,
our benchmark provides 4 distinct modality combinations for each of the 61 risk
sub-categories, covering both English and Chinese across both vulnerability and
oversensitivity dimensions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiPhishGuard是一个基于LLM的多代理钓鱼邮件检测系统，通过动态协作和对抗感知强化学习提高检测准确率，实验显示其准确率达97.89%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼邮件检测面临对抗性战术和异构攻击模式的挑战，传统方法难以应对，机器学习方法虽有所改进但仍难以适应新型钓鱼策略。

Method: 采用多代理协作框架（文本、URL、元数据、解释简化器和对抗代理），结合近端策略优化强化学习算法，并引入对抗训练循环以增强系统鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MultiPhishGuard显著优于现有方法，准确率97.89%，误报率2.73%，漏报率0.20%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过动态多代理协作和生成对抗韧性，推动了钓鱼防御的进步，并提供清晰易懂的分类解释。

Abstract: Phishing email detection faces critical challenges from evolving adversarial
tactics and heterogeneous attack patterns. Traditional detection methods, such
as rule-based filters and denylists, often struggle to keep pace with these
evolving tactics, leading to false negatives and compromised security. While
machine learning approaches have improved detection accuracy, they still face
challenges adapting to novel phishing strategies. We present MultiPhishGuard, a
dynamic LLM-based multi-agent detection system that synergizes specialized
expertise with adversarial-aware reinforcement learning. Our framework employs
five cooperative agents (text, URL, metadata, explanation simplifier, and
adversarial agents) with automatically adjusted decision weights powered by a
Proximal Policy Optimization reinforcement learning algorithm. To address
emerging threats, we introduce an adversarial training loop featuring an
adversarial agent that generates subtle context-aware email variants, creating
a self-improving defense ecosystem and enhancing system robustness.
Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard
significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thoughts, single-agent baselines and
state-of-the-art detectors, as validated by ablation studies and comparative
analyses. Experiments demonstrate that MultiPhishGuard achieves high accuracy
(97.89\%) with low false positive (2.73\%) and false negative rates (0.20\%).
Additionally, we incorporate an explanation simplifier agent, which provides
users with clear and easily understandable explanations for why an email is
classified as phishing or legitimate. This work advances phishing defense
through dynamic multi-agent collaboration and generative adversarial
resilience.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ADA的自适应防御代理系统，通过Kubernetes pod的短暂性持续轮换AI工作负载，主动破坏攻击者的假设和潜在攻击链，提供了一种更高效、敏捷的零信任安全模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态防御依赖复杂昂贵的可信计算解决方案，难以适应快速发展的AI生态系统。ADA旨在通过主动环境操纵而非被动修补，提升AI工作负载的安全性。

Method: ADA利用Kubernetes pod的短暂性，持续自动轮换AI工作负载，结合混沌工程原理，系统性地破坏攻击链。

Result: ADA提供了一种更健壮、敏捷且操作高效的零信任模型，简化了部署和维护，同时支持最新的AI生态系统和技术。

Conclusion: ADA通过主动环境操纵实现了AI服务的更高安全性，为AI基础设施安全提供了新的范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative
Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance
the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and
automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging
the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn
systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill
chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI service instances. This
methodology, applying principles of chaos engineering as a continuous,
proactive defense, offers a paradigm shift from traditional static defenses
that rely on complex and expensive confidential or trusted computing solutions
to secure the underlying compute platforms, while at the same time agnostically
supporting the latest advancements in agentic and nonagentic AI ecosystems and
solutions such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks or model
context protocols (MCP). This AI-native infrastructure design, relying on the
widely proliferated cloud-native Kubernetes technologies, facilitates easier
deployment, simplifies maintenance through an inherent zero trust posture
achieved by rotation, and promotes faster adoption. We posit that ADA's novel
approach to AMTD provides a more robust, agile, and operationally efficient
zero-trust model for AI services, achieving security through proactive
environmental manipulation rather than reactive patching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DP-RTFL的联邦学习框架，旨在解决标准FL在容错性、系统弹性和隐私保护方面的不足，适用于金融和医疗等敏感数据处理场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准联邦学习在容错性、系统弹性和隐私保护方面存在不足，可能导致训练中断、数据丢失或违反数据保护法规。

Method: DP-RTFL框架结合了本地差分隐私（LDP）、弹性时间状态管理和完整性验证机制（如基于哈希的承诺）。

Result: DP-RTFL框架实现了训练连续性、精确状态恢复和强数据隐私保护，适用于信用风险评估等关键应用。

Conclusion: DP-RTFL框架为敏感数据处理提供了一种操作稳健、可审计且可扩展的解决方案，并已开源。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a critical paradigm for enabling
privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly in regulated sectors such as
finance and healthcare. However, standard FL strategies often encounter
significant operational challenges related to fault tolerance, system
resilience against concurrent client and server failures, and the provision of
robust, verifiable privacy guarantees essential for handling sensitive data.
These deficiencies can lead to training disruptions, data loss, compromised
model integrity, and non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g.,
GDPR, CCPA). This paper introduces Differentially Private Resilient Temporal
Federated Learning (DP-RTFL), an advanced FL framework designed to ensure
training continuity, precise state recovery, and strong data privacy. DP-RTFL
integrates local Differential Privacy (LDP) at the client level with resilient
temporal state management and integrity verification mechanisms, such as
hash-based commitments (referred to as Zero-Knowledge Integrity Proofs or ZKIPs
in this context). The framework is particularly suited for critical
applications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data, aiming
to be operationally robust, auditable, and scalable for enterprise AI
deployments. The implementation of the DP-RTFL framework is available as
open-source.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）正发展为跨组织边界的自主代理，但跨域协作打破了现有对齐与安全技术的信任假设，带来新的安全挑战。本文提出了七类安全挑战及相关攻击、评估指标与研究建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM成为跨组织协作的自主代理，传统单域信任假设失效，多智能体动态可能引发数据泄露或策略违规，亟需研究跨域多智能体系统的安全框架。

Method: 通过分析跨域多智能体交互场景，归纳七类安全挑战（如信任传递、策略冲突等），并为每类设计攻击案例、量化指标和研究方向。

Result: 提出包含信任边界划分、动态策略验证等七维度的安全议程，建立攻击分类法与评估体系，指明需解决的新型多智能体风险。

Conclusion: 跨域LLM协作需重构安全范式，未来研究应聚焦于多智能体特有的动态风险，而非仅移植传统软件安全方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that
cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response,
supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise
without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters
the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment
techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an
untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by
emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This
position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM
systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each
of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and
future research guidelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据质量参差不齐且隐私受限，传统方法难以评估和确保数据准备度，影响模型性能。

Method: 引入CADRE框架，允许用户自定义数据准备度标准、指标和补救措施，生成详细报告并集成到现有隐私保护联邦学习系统中。

Result: 在六个数据集上验证，成功解决七类数据准备问题，证明框架在数据质量、隐私和公平性等多维度的有效性。

Conclusion: CADRE能提前识别并解决数据问题，提升联邦学习模型的性能和可靠性，同时优化资源利用。

Abstract: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) is a decentralized machine
learning approach where multiple clients train a model collaboratively. PPFL
preserves privacy and security of the client's data by not exchanging it.
However, ensuring that data at each client is of high quality and ready for
federated learning (FL) is a challenge due to restricted data access. In this
paper, we introduce CADRE (Customizable Assurance of Data REadiness) for FL, a
novel framework that allows users to define custom data readiness (DR)
standards, metrics, rules, and remedies tailored to specific FL tasks. Our
framework generates comprehensive DR reports based on the user-defined metrics,
rules, and remedies to ensure datasets are optimally prepared for FL while
preserving privacy. We demonstrate the framework's practical application by
integrating it into an existing PPFL framework. We conducted experiments across
six diverse datasets, addressing seven different DR issues. The results
illustrate the framework's versatility and effectiveness in ensuring DR across
various dimensions, including data quality, privacy, and fairness. This
approach enhances the performance and reliability of FL models as well as
utilizes valuable resources by identifying and addressing data-related issues
before the training phase.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KGMARK是首个针对动态知识图谱的水印框架，通过聚类对齐和冗余嵌入策略解决结构化数据的时空变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方法主要针对静态文本或图像，难以应用于动态图数据，因此需要一种能适应时空变化的水印框架。

Method: 提出基于聚类的对齐方法适应空间变化，冗余嵌入策略增强时间变化下的鲁棒性，并引入可学习掩码矩阵提升透明度。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中验证了KGMARK的有效性。

Conclusion: KGMARK成功解决了结构化数据的水印挑战，兼具鲁棒性、可检测性和透明性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are ubiquitous in numerous real-world applications,
and watermarking facilitates protecting intellectual property and preventing
potential harm from AI-generated content. Existing watermarking methods mainly
focus on static plain text or image data, while they can hardly be applied to
dynamic graphs due to spatial and temporal variations of structured data. This
motivates us to propose KGMARK, the first graph watermarking framework that
aims to generate robust, detectable, and transparent diffusion fingerprints for
dynamic KG data. Specifically, we propose a novel clustering-based alignment
method to adapt the watermark to spatial variations. Meanwhile, we present a
redundant embedding strategy to harden the diffusion watermark against various
attacks, facilitating the robustness of the watermark to the temporal
variations. Additionally, we introduce a novel learnable mask matrix to improve
the transparency of diffusion fingerprints. By doing so, our KGMARK properly
tackles the variation challenges of structured data. Experiments on various
public benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed KGMARK.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型威胁——利用机器学习模型的谨慎预测机制进行歧视性服务拒绝，并设计了Mirage攻击来演示其可行性。为应对此威胁，作者提出了Confidential Guardian框架，通过校准度分析和零知识证明确保置信度真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，机器学习模型的谨慎预测（即在不确定时放弃预测）对减少错误至关重要。然而，机构可能滥用这一机制，以不确定性为借口进行歧视或拒绝服务。

Method: 1) 提出Mirage攻击，通过针对性降低特定输入区域的置信度实现隐蔽歧视；2) 开发Confidential Guardian框架，结合参考数据集校准度分析和零知识证明技术验证置信度真实性。

Result: 实验证明Mirage攻击能有效操纵模型置信度而不影响整体性能，而Confidential Guardian可成功检测人为压低的置信度，确保弃权行为反映真实模型不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了谨慎预测机制可能被滥用的风险，提出的防御框架为模型不确定性提供了可验证的保证，防止了恶意利用。

Abstract: Cautious predictions -- where a machine learning model abstains when
uncertain -- are crucial for limiting harmful errors in safety-critical
applications. In this work, we identify a novel threat: a dishonest institution
can exploit these mechanisms to discriminate or unjustly deny services under
the guise of uncertainty. We demonstrate the practicality of this threat by
introducing an uncertainty-inducing attack called Mirage, which deliberately
reduces confidence in targeted input regions, thereby covertly disadvantaging
specific individuals. At the same time, Mirage maintains high predictive
performance across all data points. To counter this threat, we propose
Confidential Guardian, a framework that analyzes calibration metrics on a
reference dataset to detect artificially suppressed confidence. Additionally,
it employs zero-knowledge proofs of verified inference to ensure that reported
confidence scores genuinely originate from the deployed model. This prevents
the provider from fabricating arbitrary model confidence values while
protecting the model's proprietary details. Our results confirm that
Confidential Guardian effectively prevents the misuse of cautious predictions,
providing verifiable assurances that abstention reflects genuine model
uncertainty rather than malicious intent.

Motivation: LLM智能体在自动化复杂任务中展现出潜力，但多智能体交互及上下文操纵带来的隐私泄露和系统滥用风险需要解决。

Method: 提出AgentSandbox框架，嵌入深度防御、最小权限等安全原则，评估其在良性/对抗场景下的效用和攻击缓解效果。

Result: AgentSandbox在保持功能效用的同时显著降低隐私风险，验证了安全原则在智能体系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: 将安全设计原则作为LLM智能体协议的基础要素，可构建符合隐私预期和监管要求的可信智能体生态系统。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show considerable promise for automating
complex tasks using contextual reasoning; however, interactions involving
multiple agents and the system's susceptibility to prompt injection and other
forms of context manipulation introduce new vulnerabilities related to privacy
leakage and system exploitation. This position paper argues that the
well-established design principles in information security, which are commonly
referred to as security principles, should be employed when deploying LLM
agents at scale. Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege,
complete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the
design of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five
decades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help
secure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox,
a conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide
safeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle. We evaluate with state-of-the-art
LLMs along three dimensions: benign utility, attack utility, and attack success
rate. AgentSandbox maintains high utility for its intended functions under both
benign and adversarial evaluations while substantially mitigating privacy
risks. By embedding secure design principles as foundational elements within
emerging LLM agent protocols, we aim to promote trustworthy agent ecosystems
aligned with user privacy expectations and evolving regulatory requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络攻击频繁，WebShell利用与防御成为研究重点，但公开的、按混淆方法分类的恶意代码数据集稀缺，现有生成方法多样性不足且冗余高。

Method: 首先将WebShell样本按混淆方法分类，利用LLM提取并规范化关键令牌构建高质量语料库，通过监督微调开源大模型生成多样化恶意负载，并应用PPO进一步优化生成质量。

Result: 实验表明，RAWG在负载多样性和逃逸效果上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAWG为红队应用提供了一种高效的WebShell恶意代码生成方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Frequent cyber-attacks have elevated WebShell exploitation and defense to a
critical research focus within network security. However, there remains a
significant shortage of publicly available, well-categorized malicious-code
datasets organized by obfuscation method. Existing malicious-code generation
methods, which primarily rely on prompt engineering, often suffer from limited
diversity and high redundancy in the payloads they produce. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{RAWG}, a \textbf{R}eward-driven
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{W}ebshell Malicious-code \textbf{G}enerator designed
for red-teaming applications. Our approach begins by categorizing webshell
samples from common datasets into seven distinct types of obfuscation. We then
employ a large language model (LLM) to extract and normalize key tokens from
each sample, creating a standardized, high-quality corpus. Using this curated
dataset, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an open-source large model
to enable the generation of diverse, highly obfuscated webshell malicious
payloads. To further enhance generation quality, we apply Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), treating malicious-code samples as "chosen" data and benign
code as "rejected" data during reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RAWG significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in both payload diversity and escape effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在网络安全漏洞检测中需大量计算资源进行压缩与微调，研究旨在通过早期性能预估减少计算开销。

Method: 采用线性探针（LPs）在BERT和Gemma模型上测试，针对12种MITRE高危漏洞检测，分析层剪枝对性能的影响。

Result: LPASS方法可移除33.3%-72.2%的模型层且精度无损，压缩后Gemma模型F1分数提升1.6%，训练/推理时间节省29.4%/23.8%，模型体积减小42.98%。

Conclusion: LPASS能高效预估压缩模型性能，显著降低计算成本，并在多类漏洞检测中达到86.9%准确率，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being extensively used for cybersecurity
purposes. One of them is the detection of vulnerable codes. For the sake of
efficiency and effectiveness, compression and fine-tuning techniques are being
developed, respectively. However, they involve spending substantial
computational efforts. In this vein, we analyse how Linear Probes (LPs) can be
used to provide an estimation on the performance of a compressed LLM at an
early phase -- before fine-tuning. We also show their suitability to set the
cut-off point when applying layer pruning compression. Our approach, dubbed
$LPASS$, is applied in BERT and Gemma for the detection of 12 of MITRE's Top 25
most dangerous vulnerabilities on 480k C/C++ samples. LPs can be computed in
142.97 s. and provide key findings: (1) 33.3 \% and 72.2\% of layers can be
removed, respectively, with no precision loss; (2) they provide an early
estimate of the post-fine-tuning and post-compression model effectiveness, with
3\% and 8.68\% as the lowest and average precision errors, respectively.
$LPASS$-based LLMs outperform the state of the art, reaching 86.9\% of accuracy
in multi-class vulnerability detection. Interestingly, $LPASS$-based compressed
versions of Gemma outperform the original ones by 1.6\% of F1-score at a
maximum while saving 29.4 \% and 23.8\% of training and inference time and
42.98\% of model size.

*Chaohui Xu,Qi Cui,Chip-Hong Chang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于变色龙哈希的不可逆护照（CHIP）框架，用于保护大规模深度神经网络的IP，实现强所有权验证、高保真、主动使用授权和用户追踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模深度神经网络（DNNs）训练成本高昂，其知识产权（IP）保护至关重要。现有的水印和护照方法无法提供全面的保护，特别是在面对模糊攻击、离线分发模型和多用户MLaaS云模型时。

Method: 利用密码学变色龙哈希函数的抗碰撞特性，CHIP框架实现了强所有权声明和用户追踪，同时利用陷门碰撞特性实现多用户护照和许可证证书的哈希签名，以控制使用权限。

Result: 在四个数据集和两种架构上的广泛评估表明，CHIP框架在保护多功能性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CHIP框架通过变色龙哈希函数，为DNNs提供了全面的IP保护方案，包括所有权验证、使用控制和用户追踪，适用于离线分发和MLaaS场景。

Abstract: The pervasion of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their enormous
training costs make their intellectual property (IP) protection of paramount
importance. Recently introduced passport-based methods attempt to steer DNN
watermarking towards strengthening ownership verification against ambiguity
attacks by modulating the affine parameters of normalization layers.
Unfortunately, neither watermarking nor passport-based methods provide a
holistic protection with robust ownership proof, high fidelity, active usage
authorization and user traceability for offline access distributed models and
multi-user Machine-Learning as a Service (MLaaS) cloud model. In this paper, we
propose a Chameleon Hash-based Irreversible Passport (CHIP) protection
framework that utilizes the cryptographic chameleon hash function to achieve
all these goals. The collision-resistant property of chameleon hash allows for
strong model ownership claim upon IP infringement and liable user traceability,
while the trapdoor-collision property enables hashing of multiple user
passports and licensee certificates to the same immutable signature to realize
active usage control. Using the owner passport as an oracle, multiple
user-specific triplets, each contains a passport-aware user model, a user
passport, and a licensee certificate can be created for secure offline
distribution. The watermarked master model can also be deployed for MLaaS with
usage permission verifiable by the provision of any trapdoor-colliding user
passports. CHIP is extensively evaluated on four datasets and two architectures
to demonstrate its protection versatility and robustness. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Dshm212/CHIP.

Result: 以当前最优单标签防御PatchCleanser为基础，在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上实现了非平凡稳健性，同时保持高清洁准确率。

Conclusion: PatchDEMUX为多标签分类器提供了首个可证明的对抗补丁防御框架，通过任务分解和边界优化实现了实用级防御效果。

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have enabled vast improvements in computer vision
technologies. Nevertheless, these models are vulnerable to adversarial patch
attacks which catastrophically impair performance. The physically realizable
nature of these attacks calls for certifiable defenses, which feature provable
guarantees on robustness. While certifiable defenses have been successfully
applied to single-label classification, limited work has been done for
multi-label classification. In this work, we present PatchDEMUX, a certifiably
robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our
approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable
defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the
multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification
problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore, in the scenario where
an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification
procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds. Using the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-label certifiable defense PatchCleanser as a
backbone, we find that PatchDEMUX can achieve non-trivial robustness on the
MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets while maintaining high clean performance

### [368] [Exploring Societal Concerns and Perceptions of AI: A Thematic Analysis through the Lens of Problem-Seeking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23930)
*Naomi Omeonga wa Kayembe*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究提出新框架区分人类'问题寻找'与AI'问题解决'能力，通过分析YouTube视频揭示公众对AI的矛盾态度，主张发展情感与数字素养以实现人本AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在澄清人类智能与AI的本质差异，批判将智能与目标内容分离的'正交论'，强调具身认知对人类目标设定的核心作用。

Method: 混合方法：对157个AI相关YouTube视频元数据进行主题分析，结合定性洞察与关键词定量指标。

Result: 发现公众对AI存在双重情绪（ fascination与焦虑），并识别出隐私、失业、伦理等核心议题；证实AI缺乏人类具身认知的导向能力。

Conclusion: 应重构AI作为人类智能增强工具的公共叙事，将'问题寻找'确立为智能核心维度，推动情感素养教育以实现伦理对齐的AI发展。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel conceptual framework distinguishing
problem-seeking from problem-solving to clarify the unique features of human
intelligence in contrast to AI. Problem-seeking refers to the embodied,
emotionally grounded process by which humans identify and set goals, while
problem-solving denotes the execution of strategies aimed at achieving such
predefined objectives. The framework emphasizes that while AI excels at
efficiency and optimization, it lacks the orientation derived from experiential
grounding and the embodiment flexibility intrinsic to human cognition. To
empirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157
YouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining
qualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this
mixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including
privacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The
results reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities
coexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The
discussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence
is separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence
integrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of
embodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come
from its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for
enhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement.
It calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments
-- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking
at the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this
research offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI
development.

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估AI教育应用能力的通用基准，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 组织189名教育工作者模拟真实教学场景，对Gemini、Claude、GPT-4等模型进行多轮盲测，由206名专家评估效果。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro在73.2%的对比中胜出，且在核心教学原则指标上表现突出。

Conclusion: Gemini 2.5 Pro被证实为当前最适合教育场景的AI模型。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform education, but the
research community lacks a robust, general benchmark to evaluate AI models for
learning. To assess state-of-the-art support for educational use cases, we ran
an "arena for learning" where educators and pedagogy experts conduct blind,
head-to-head, multi-turn comparisons of leading AI models. In particular, $N =
189$ educators drew from their experience to role-play realistic learning use
cases, interacting with two models sequentially, after which $N = 206$ experts
judged which model better supported the user's learning goals. The arena
evaluated a slate of state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4o, and OpenAI o3. Excluding ties, experts preferred Gemini 2.5 Pro
in 73.2% of these match-ups -- ranking it first overall in the arena. Gemini
2.5 Pro also demonstrated markedly higher performance across key principles of
good pedagogy. Altogether, these results position Gemini 2.5 Pro as a leading
model for learning.

publication production pipeline and a policy framework for co-intelligence
adaptation and reinforcing credibility-centered standards in AI-powered
research. These insights support scholars, educators, and policymakers in
understanding AI's transformative impact by advocating responsible and
innovation-driven knowledge production. Additionally, they reveal pathways for

Method: 采用监督学习训练干涉仪模型，结合解析法（相位偏移推导酉矩阵）或优化法（无分解时）编程光学模式变换。

Result: 算法能有效确定特定架构干涉仪的相位偏移，实现目标酉变换，且不依赖解析解。

Conclusion: 该方法为干涉仪调谐提供了灵活框架，推动了新型干涉电路架构的设计自由。

Abstract: We have developed an algorithm that constructs a model of a reconfigurable
optical interferometer, independent of specific architectural constraints. The
programming of unitary transformations on the interferometer's optical modes
relies on either an analytical method for deriving the unitary matrix from a
set of phase shifts or an optimization routine when such decomposition is not
available. Our algorithm employs a supervised learning approach, aligning the
interferometer model with a training set derived from the device being studied.
A straightforward optimization procedure leverages this trained model to
determine the phase shifts of the interferometer with a specific architecture,
obtaining the required unitary transformation. This approach enables the
effective tuning of interferometers without requiring a precise analytical
solution, paving the way for the exploration of new interferometric circuit
architectures.

Motivation: 在缺乏全采样参考数据的情况下，自监督学习被广泛应用于训练物理驱动的深度学习模型，但在高加速率下常引入伪影，影响图像保真度。

Method: 论文提出了一种新颖的训练策略，通过增强传统的k空间掩模自监督学习方法，引入一致性项来评估模型在稀疏域中准确预测添加扰动的能力。

Result: 在fastMRI膝盖和大脑数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了高加速率下的混叠伪影和噪声放大，视觉和定量评估均优于现有自监督方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的训练策略显著提升了高加速率MRI重建的质量，为无参考数据场景下的自监督学习提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful
approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train
these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable,
self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at
high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image
fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL
networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the
k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel
consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the
added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and
artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and
brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces
aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration
rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and
quantitatively.

Result: 通过加速器、光学和终端用户应用实例，展示了该策略如何实现设计性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习驱动的实时优化是应对高亮度光源实验挑战的关键解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing brightness of Light sources, including the
Diffraction-Limited brightness upgrade of APS and the high-repetition-rate
upgrade of LCLS, the proposed experiments therein are becoming increasingly
complex. For instance, experiments at LCLS-II-HE will require the X-ray beam to
be within a fraction of a micron in diameter, with pointing stability of a few
nanoradians, at the end of a kilometer-long electron accelerator, a
hundred-meter-long undulator section, and tens of meters long X-ray optics.
This enhancement of brightness will increase the data production rate to rival
the largest data generators in the world. Without real-time active feedback
control and an optimized pipeline to transform measurements to scientific
information and insights, researchers will drown in a deluge of mostly useless
data, and fail to extract the highly sophisticated insights that the recent
brightness upgrades promise.
  In this article, we outline the strategy we are developing at SLAC to
implement Machine Learning driven optimization, automation and real-time
knowledge extraction from the electron-injector at the start of the electron
accelerator, to the multidimensional X-ray optical systems, and till the
experimental endstations and the high readout rate, multi-megapixel detectors
at LCLS to deliver the design performance to the users. This is illustrated via
examples from Accelerator, Optics and End User applications.

Conclusion: LLM+Debrief方法在提升自动驾驶车辆通信和协作方面表现出色，为未来智能交通系统的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Past work has demonstrated that autonomous vehicles can drive more safely if
they communicate with one another than if they do not. However, their
communication has often not been human-understandable. Using natural language
as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocol offers the potential for
autonomous vehicles to drive cooperatively not only with each other but also
with human drivers. In this work, we propose a suite of traffic tasks in
autonomous driving where vehicles in a traffic scenario need to communicate in
natural language to facilitate coordination in order to avoid an imminent
collision and/or support efficient traffic flow. To this end, this paper
introduces a novel method, LLM+Debrief, to learn a message generation and
high-level decision-making policy for autonomous vehicles through multi-agent
discussion. To evaluate LLM agents for driving, we developed a gym-like
simulation environment that contains a range of driving scenarios. Our
experimental results demonstrate that LLM+Debrief is more effective at
generating meaningful and human-understandable natural language messages to
facilitate cooperation and coordination than a zero-shot LLM agent. Our code

Conclusion: DiG-Net通过远距离手势识别显著提升了辅助机器人在家庭医疗、工业安全和远程协助等场景中的可用性，为用户提供了无缝且直观的交互体验。

Abstract: Dynamic hand gestures play a pivotal role in assistive human-robot
interaction (HRI), facilitating intuitive, non-verbal communication,
particularly for individuals with mobility constraints or those operating
robots remotely. Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to
short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust
assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture
recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly
improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware
Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable
Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust
processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging
conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and
dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive
environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth
Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model
robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant
performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks,
achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging
hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable
distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in
home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling
seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical

Result: 在Waymo数据集上碰撞率降低40%，长尾事件泛化能力和轨迹多样性显著提升。

Conclusion: 任务相关的检索模型结合规划目标能有效提升框架性能，实现更安全的驾驶行为生成。

Abstract: Learning-based planners generate natural human-like driving behaviors by
learning to reason about nuanced interactions from data, overcoming the rigid
behaviors that arise from rule-based planners. Nonetheless, data-driven
approaches often struggle with rare, safety-critical scenarios and offer
limited controllability over the generated trajectories. To address these
challenges, we propose RealDrive, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework that initializes a diffusion-based planning policy by retrieving the
most relevant expert demonstrations from the training dataset. By interpolating
between current observations and retrieved examples through a denoising
process, our approach enables fine-grained control and safe behavior across
diverse scenarios, leveraging the strong prior provided by the retrieved
scenario. Another key insight we produce is that a task-relevant retrieval
model trained with planning-based objectives results in superior planning
performance in our framework compared to a task-agnostic retriever.
Experimental results demonstrate improved generalization to long-tail events
and enhanced trajectory diversity compared to standard learning-based planners
-- we observe a 40% reduction in collision rate on the Waymo Open Motion
dataset with RAG.

Conclusion: 该工作为灵巧手硬件能力评估提供了平台，有望降低未来研究的门槛。

Abstract: We study the problem of functional retargeting: learning dexterous
manipulation policies to track object states from human hand-object
demonstrations. We focus on long-horizon, bimanual tasks with articulated
objects, which is challenging due to large action space, spatiotemporal
discontinuities, and embodiment gap between human and robot hands. We propose
DexMachina, a novel curriculum-based algorithm: the key idea is to use virtual
object controllers with decaying strength: an object is first driven
automatically towards its target states, such that the policy can gradually
learn to take over under motion and contact guidance. We release a simulation
benchmark with a diverse set of tasks and dexterous hands, and show that
DexMachina significantly outperforms baseline methods. Our algorithm and
benchmark enable a functional comparison for hardware designs, and we present
key findings informed by quantitative and qualitative results. With the recent
surge in dexterous hand development, we hope this work will provide a useful
platform for identifying desirable hardware capabilities and lower the barrier
for contributing to future research. Videos and more at

Method: 利用3D基础模型提取密集无标记多视角对应关系，同步估计摄像头外参、机械臂间位姿及统一3D场景表示。

Result: Bi-JCR在多种桌面环境中验证了鲁棒性，并展示其在语义分割、碰撞检测等下游任务的应用效果。

Conclusion: 该框架为双臂协作提供免标定的实时环境感知解决方案，显著简化机器人系统部署流程。

Abstract: Robot manipulation, especially bimanual manipulation, often requires setting
up multiple cameras on multiple robot manipulators. Before robot manipulators
can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the
cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration
is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each
capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual
Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables
multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking
images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense,
marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the
extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the
inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified,
scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same
captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images
captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame
and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate
downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness
of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its
applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 生成式AI在长期叙事中有潜力，但也需关注用户代理和伦理问题，为设计自适应、超人类叙事系统提供初步见解。

Abstract: Longitudinal engagement with generative AI (GenAI) storytelling agents is a
timely but less charted domain. We explored multi-generational experiences with
"Dreamsmithy," a daily dream-crafting app, where participants (N = 28)
co-created stories with AI narrator "Makoto" every day. Reflections and
interactions were captured through a two-week diary study. Reflexive thematic
analysis revealed themes likes "oscillating ambivalence" and
"socio-chronological bonding," highlighting the complex dynamics that emerged
between individuals and the AI narrator over time. Findings suggest that while
people appreciated the personal notes, opportunities for reflection, and AI
creativity, limitations in narrative coherence and control occasionally caused
frustration. The results underscore the potential of GenAI for longitudinal
storytelling, but also raise critical questions about user agency and ethics.
We contribute initial empirical insights and design considerations for
developing adaptive, more-than-human storytelling systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出使用数字孪生（digital twins）来平衡众包平台中AI工具使用与人类参与的矛盾，通过实验和访谈验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 众包平台（如Amazon Mechanical Turk和Prolific）对研究至关重要，但工作者越来越多地使用生成式AI工具，导致数据有效性受损和工作者角色弱化。研究者需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一个混合框架，利用数字孪生（个性化AI模型）模拟工作者行为，同时保持人类参与。通过实验（n=88）和深度访谈（工作者n=5，研究者n=4）评估系统。

Result: 数字孪生能提高生产力、减少决策疲劳，同时保持响应质量。研究者和工作者均强调透明度、伦理数据使用和工作者自主权的重要性。

Conclusion: 数字孪生通过自动化重复任务并保留人类参与复杂任务，有助于在可扩展性和真实性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific are vital for
research, yet workers' growing use of generative AI tools poses challenges.
Researchers face compromised data validity as AI responses replace authentic
human behavior, while workers risk diminished roles as AI automates tasks. To
address this, we propose a hybrid framework using digital twins, personalized
AI models that emulate workers' behaviors and preferences while keeping humans
in the loop. We evaluate our system with an experiment (n=88 crowd workers) and
in-depth interviews with crowd workers (n=5) and social science researchers
(n=4). Our results suggest that digital twins may enhance productivity and
reduce decision fatigue while maintaining response quality. Both researchers
and workers emphasized the importance of transparency, ethical data use, and
worker agency. By automating repetitive tasks and preserving human engagement
for nuanced ones, digital twins may help balance scalability with authenticity.

TL;DR: WikiGap系统通过多语言信息差发现方法和用户中心设计，在英文维基百科界面展示其他语言版本的补充信息，显著提高了信息查找准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英文维基百科在全球知识获取中占据主导地位，但其他语言版本包含的文化和媒体环境相关的补充信息被边缘化。当前的语言切换系统未能有效展示这些有价值的信息。

Method: 结合多语言信息差发现方法和用户中心设计，开发了WikiGap系统，支持从法语、俄语和中文维基百科获取补充信息。

Result: 在混合方法研究中（n=21），WikiGap显著提高了事实查找的准确性，减少了任务时间，并获得了比当前语言链接导航系统高32分的可用性评分。

Conclusion: WikiGap提高了用户对非英文维基百科补充信息的认识，重新评估了英文维基百科的完整性，为跨语言版本的知识公平铺平了道路。

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia
dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers
are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions,
leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English.
Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their
respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English
Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language
editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to
readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary
information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts
sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface.
Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery
method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary
information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods
study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced
task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to
Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported
increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in
non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia.
WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language
editions.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种分布式梯度方法，用于解决在通信噪声呈现重尾分布时的网络优化问题，通过精心设计的步长和非线性算子保证收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集部署的无线传感器和物联网网络中，节点间通信常受到重尾噪声的影响，现有分布式优化方法无法有效处理此类噪声。

Method: 设计了一种分布式梯度方法，结合混合时间尺度的时变共识和梯度步长，并在共识更新中使用有界非线性算子以抑制重尾噪声的影响。

Result: 在局部成本函数强凸且极小值点各异的情况下，该方法能在均方误差意义下收敛到网络全局解的邻域，且收敛速率可量化。通过调整步长可使渐近误差任意小。

Conclusion: 该方法对重尾（甚至无限方差）噪声具有鲁棒性，数值实验验证了其有效性，而现有方法在此类噪声下会失效。

Abstract: We consider a standard distributed optimization problem in which networked
nodes collaboratively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. For
this setting, we address for the first time the fundamental problem of design
and analysis of distributed methods to solve the above problem when inter-node
communication is subject to \emph{heavy-tailed} noise. Heavy-tailed noise is
highly relevant and frequently arises in densely deployed wireless sensor and
Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we design a distributed
gradient-type method that features a carefully balanced mixed time-scale
time-varying consensus and gradient contribution step sizes and a bounded
nonlinear operator on the consensus update to limit the effect of heavy-tailed
noise. Assuming heterogeneous strongly convex local costs with mutually
different minimizers that are arbitrarily far apart, we show that the proposed
method converges to a neighborhood of the network-wide problem solution in the
mean squared error (MSE) sense, and we also characterize the corresponding
convergence rate. We further show that the asymptotic MSE can be made
arbitrarily small through consensus step-size tuning, possibly at the cost of
slowing down the transient error decay. Numerical experiments corroborate our
findings and demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method to heavy-tailed
(and infinite variance) communication noise. They also show that existing
distributed methods, designed for finite-communication-noise-variance settings,
fail in the presence of infinite variance noise.

TL;DR: 论文提出Chameleon方案，通过统一架构、时序卷积网络和双模计算阵列实现低功耗端到端片上学习，在小样本学习和持续学习任务中刷新准确率记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备上低功耗端到端片上学习的挑战，特别是在真实世界序列数据和小样本情况下的学习性能与推理效率的平衡问题。

Method: 采用(i)统一学习推理架构(ii)时序卷积网络捕捉长时依赖(iii)无矩阵乘法的双模计算阵列。

Result: 在Omniglot上实现小样本学习(5-way 1-shot 96.8%)和持续学习(250类82.2%)新记录，语音命令数据集推理准确率93.3%，功耗仅3.1μW。

Conclusion: Chameleon在保持超低功耗的同时，显著提升了边缘设备上小样本学习和持续学习的性能，为端到端片上学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization
with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet,
achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from
real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open
challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for
learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified
learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this
work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these
challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot
learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area
overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are
efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the
first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and
inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free
compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art
inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$
higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records
on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way
5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots),
while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech
Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.

Motivation: 蛋白质动态对其生物功能和性质至关重要，传统研究方法依赖于耗时的分子动力学模拟。虽然生成模型（如去噪扩散模型）在蛋白质结构预测和构象采样方面取得了进展，但如何有效整合物理监督仍具挑战性。

Method: 论文提出Energy-based Alignment (EBA)方法，通过将生成模型与物理模型的反馈对齐，校准模型以平衡构象状态的能量差异。

Result: 在MD集成基准测试中，EBA在生成高质量蛋白质集成方面达到了最先进的性能，提升了生成结构的物理合理性。

Conclusion: EBA方法通过提升生成结构的物理合理性，增强了模型预测能力，在结构生物学和药物发现领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and
properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in
generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled
efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by
learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively
integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains
challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a
method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models,
efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states
based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble
benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical
plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions
and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.

Motivation: 旋转机械日益复杂的工作条件（如变速、变扭矩）和复合故障诊断的需求，使得传统方法在部分标记目标数据集上的领域适应面临挑战。

Method: 提出多输出分类框架，结合跨任务选择性信息共享的跨话层结构和频率层归一化技术，优化复合故障诊断的领域适应性能。

Result: 在六种领域适应场景中，所提模型的宏F1性能优于基线模型，尤其在复合故障场景中结构优势更明显，且频率层归一化效果优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 模型性能提升主要源于其结构设计能有效利用故障分类任务间的交互作用，而非单纯增加参数。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of rotating machinery and the diversity of
operating conditions, such as rotating speed and varying torques, have
amplified the challenges in fault diagnosis in scenarios requiring domain
adaptation, particularly involving compound faults. This study addresses these
challenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework
tailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled (PL) target datasets.
Unlike conventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the proposed
MOC framework classifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously.
Furthermore, we explore various single-task and multi-task architectures
applicable to the MOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based
designs-for compound fault diagnosis under PL conditions. Based on this
investigation, we propose a novel cross-talk layer structure that enables
selective information sharing across diagnostic tasks, effectively enhancing
classification performance in compound fault scenarios. In addition,
frequency-layer normalization was incorporated to improve domain adaptation
performance on motor vibration data. Compound fault conditions were implemented
using a motor-based test setup, and the proposed model was evaluated across six
domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior
macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed that the
proposed mode's structural advantage is more pronounced in compound fault
settings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer
normalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods.
Lastly, we discuss that this improvement primarily stems from the model's
structural ability to leverage inter-fault classification task interactions,
rather than from a simple increase in model parameters.

Abstract: Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is
still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as
industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a
hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model
of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to
a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation
mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach
is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for
thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions,
something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach
is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without
changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step
toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing
fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the
safety of workers.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usage is expected to surge in the coming
decade, raising the need for heightened security measures to prevent airspace
violations and security threats. This study investigates deep learning
approaches to UAV classification focusing on the key issue of data scarcity. To
investigate this we opted to train the models using a total of 4,500 seconds of
audio samples, evenly distributed across a 9-class dataset. We leveraged
parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and data augmentations to mitigate the
data scarcity. This paper implements and compares the use of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and attention-based transformers. Our results show that,
CNNs outperform transformers by 1-2\% accuracy, while still being more
computationally efficient. These early findings, however, point to potential in
using transformers models; suggesting that with more data and further
optimizations they could outperform CNNs. Future works aims to upscale the
dataset to better understand the trade-offs between these approaches.

higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio
reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio

configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound
field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone
arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs
directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range
of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic
absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of
the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The
dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio,
particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room

Result: 实验表明Discl-VC在零样本语音转换中表现优异，且在合成语音的韵律控制上具有显著准确性。

Conclusion: Discl-VC框架有效提升了语音转换的可控性和韵律控制的精确度。

Abstract: Currently, zero-shot voice conversion systems are capable of synthesizing the
voice of unseen speakers. However, most existing approaches struggle to
accurately replicate the speaking style of the source speaker or mimic the
distinctive speaking style of the target speaker, thereby limiting the
controllability of voice conversion. In this work, we propose Discl-VC, a novel
voice conversion framework that disentangles content and prosody information
from self-supervised speech representations and synthesizes the target
speaker's voice through in-context learning with a flow matching transformer.
To enable precise control over the prosody of generated speech, we introduce a
mask generative transformer that predicts discrete prosody tokens in a
non-autoregressive manner based on prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of Discl-VC in zero-shot voice conversion and its
remarkable accuracy in prosody control for synthesized speech.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised framework for detecting audio patterns
in musical samples (loops) through anomaly detection techniques, addressing
challenges in music information retrieval (MIR). Existing methods are often
constrained by reliance on handcrafted features, domain-specific limitations,
or dependence on iterative user interaction. We address these limitations
through an architecture combining deep feature extraction with unsupervised
anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a pre-trained Hierarchical
Token-semantic Audio Transformer (HTS-AT), paired with a Feature Fusion
Mechanism (FFM), to generate representations from variable-length audio loops.
These embeddings are processed using one-class Deep Support Vector Data
Description (Deep SVDD), which learns normative audio patterns by mapping them
to a compact latent hypersphere. Evaluations on curated bass and guitar
datasets compare standard and residual autoencoder variants against baselines
like Isolation Forest (IF) and and principle component analysis (PCA) methods.
Results show our Deep SVDD models, especially the residual autoencoder variant,
deliver improved anomaly separation, particularly for larger variations. This
research contributes a flexible, fully unsupervised solution for processing
diverse audio samples, overcoming previous structural and input limitations
while enabling effective pattern identification through distance-based latent
space scoring.

Motivation: 生物医学信号存在患者间差异，需考虑个体差异的学习方法。

Method: 使用PCSL和GPAL两种损失函数，分别处理患者特征聚类和对齐。

Result: 在ICBHI数据集上四分类64.84%、二分类72.08%的优异结果。

Conclusion: PAFA能捕捉个体化模式，在患者聚类中表现优异，适用于以患者为中心的医疗。

Abstract: Lung sound classification is vital for early diagnosis of respiratory
diseases. However, biomedical signals often exhibit inter-patient variability
even among patients with the same symptoms, requiring a learning approach that
considers individual differences. We propose a Patient-Aware Feature Alignment
(PAFA) framework with two novel losses, Patient Cohesion-Separation Loss (PCSL)
and Global Patient Alignment Loss (GPAL). PCSL clusters features of the same
patient while separating those from other patients to capture patient
variability, whereas GPAL draws each patient's centroid toward a global center,
preventing feature space fragmentation. Our method achieves outstanding results
on the ICBHI dataset with a score of 64.84\% for four-class and 72.08\% for
two-class classification. These findings highlight PAFA's ability to capture
individualized patterns and demonstrate performance gains in distinct patient
clusters, offering broader applications for patient-centered healthcare.

Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造检测框架在面对新型攻击时性能下降，且传统排练方法无法有效捕捉音频多样性，导致偏差和遗忘风险。

Method: 提出RAIS方法，利用标签生成网络产生辅助标签，指导内存缓冲区中的多样化样本选择。

Result: RAIS在五个实验中平均等错误率(EER)为1.953%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAIS通过多样化样本选择和辅助标签，有效提升了音频深度伪造检测的持续学习性能。

Abstract: The performance of existing audio deepfake detection frameworks degrades when
confronted with new deepfake attacks. Rehearsal-based continual learning (CL),
which updates models using a limited set of old data samples, helps preserve
prior knowledge while incorporating new information. However, existing
rehearsal techniques don't effectively capture the diversity of audio
characteristics, introducing bias and increasing the risk of forgetting. To
address this challenge, we propose Rehearsal with Auxiliary-Informed Sampling
(RAIS), a rehearsal-based CL approach for audio deepfake detection. RAIS
employs a label generation network to produce auxiliary labels, guiding diverse
sample selection for the memory buffer. Extensive experiments show RAIS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Equal Error Rate
(EER) of 1.953 % across five experiences. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文通过多种策略改进多语言语音识别和语言识别，在ML-SUPERB 2.0上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言语音处理模型在微调时资源有限，导致性能不佳，需要改进。

Method: 采用冻结上游训练、部分微调、低秩适应等策略，并结合数据增强和LID CTC损失进行正则化。

Result: 在ML-SUPERB 2.0上，LID准确率相对提升14%，ASR CER相对降低30%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多语言语音处理性能，并在Interspeech 2025挑战赛中取得第二名。

Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained
Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like
Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However,
these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper
enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple
strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial
fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation
to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our
approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative
reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place
in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋声学场景多变导致船舶声学信号监测困难，需构建能适应不同声学环境和距离的鲁棒分类框架。

Method: 采用可训练Gabor滤波器组构建频谱前端，结合时间特征编码器和注意力机制进行传感器数据融合。

Result: 在VTUAD水听器数据集上达到96.63%准确率，超越此前基准12个百分点，并分析了滤波器特性与数据融合效果。

Conclusion: CATFISH模型通过动态频率关注机制实现了跨场景的船舶声纹高精度识别，为复杂声学环境分类提供新方案。

Abstract: Reliably monitoring and recognizing maritime vessels based on acoustic
signatures is complicated by the variability of different recording scenarios.
A robust classification framework must be able to generalize across diverse
acoustic environments and variable source-sensor distances. To this end, we
present a deep learning model with robust performance across different
recording scenarios. Using a trainable spectral front-end and temporal feature
encoder to learn a Gabor filterbank, the model can dynamically emphasize
different frequency components. Trained on the VTUAD hydrophone recordings from
the Strait of Georgia, our model, CATFISH, achieves a state-of-the-art 96.63 %
percent test accuracy across varying source-sensor distances, surpassing the
previous benchmark by over 12 percentage points. We present the model, justify
our architectural choices, analyze the learned Gabor filters, and perform
ablation studies on sensor data fusion and attention-based pooling.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于可信度评分的抗对抗性多智能体LLM框架，通过迭代学习和动态评分提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统在多个领域表现出强大能力，但容易受到对抗性及低效智能体的影响，需要一种机制来增强其抗干扰能力。

Method: 将协作问答过程建模为迭代游戏，通过动态学习各智能体的可信度评分来聚合团队输出。

Result: 实验表明，该系统能有效减轻对抗性影响，提升多智能体协作的鲁棒性，甚至在对抗性占多数的情况下仍能保持性能。

Conclusion: 基于可信度评分的框架显著增强了多智能体LLM系统的抗干扰能力和协作效率。

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains,
they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve
this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant
multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the
collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents
communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a
credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The
credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of
each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and
settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial
influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the
adversary-majority settings.

*Zijie Xu,Tong Bu,Zecheng Hao,Jianhao Ding,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型代理目标框架，解决了脉冲神经网络（SNN）在连续控制任务中训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了性能并保持了能效优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习（RL）算法主要针对人工神经网络（ANN）设计，与SNN的离散、不可微分特性存在冲突，导致SNN在连续控制任务中训练不稳定。

Method: 通过引入连续可微的代理目标框架，在训练阶段实现平滑更新，绕过SNN脉冲的不兼容性，同时保持部署时的能效优势。

Result: 实验表明，该框架使SNN性能提升高达32%，并首次用简单LIF神经元在连续控制任务中超越ANN性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发适配SNN特性的RL算法开辟了新方向，推动了高性能低功耗神经形态智能体的发展。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient
decision making through neuromorphic hardware, making them compelling for
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in resource-constrained edge devices. Recent
studies in this field directly replace Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by
SNNs in existing RL frameworks, overlooking whether the RL algorithm is
suitable for SNNs. However, most RL algorithms in continuous control are
designed tailored to ANNs, including the target network soft updates mechanism,
which conflict with the discrete, non-differentiable dynamics of SNN spikes. We
identify that this mismatch destabilizes SNN training in continuous control
tasks. To bridge this gap between discrete SNN and continuous control, we
propose a novel proxy target framework. The continuous and differentiable
dynamics of the proxy target enable smooth updates, bypassing the
incompatibility of SNN spikes, stabilizing the RL algorithms. Since the proxy
network operates only during training, the SNN retains its energy efficiency
during deployment without inference overhead. Extensive experiments on
continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that compared to vanilla SNNs, the
proxy target framework enables SNNs to achieve up to 32% higher performance
across different spiking neurons. Notably, we are the first to surpass ANN
performance in continuous control with simple Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
neurons. This work motivates a new class of SNN-friendly RL algorithms tailored
to SNN's characteristics, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that combine
high performance with low power consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法在有效支持模型比较方面存在不足，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出Representational Differences Explanations (RDX)方法，通过比较具有已知概念差异的模型来验证其有效性。

Result: RDX在ImageNet和iNaturalist数据集上成功揭示了模型间有意义的表示差异和数据的微妙模式。

Conclusion: RDX作为一种有效且可解释的工具，能够对比模型表示，弥补了当前机器学习工具在模型比较方面的不足。

Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between
two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model
comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences
Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual
differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where
existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art
models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX
reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the
data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current
tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support
model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an
effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出VisualSphinx，首个大规模合成的视觉逻辑推理训练数据集，通过规则到图像的合成流程提升视觉语言模型在逻辑推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）缺乏大规模且结构良好的训练数据集，限制了其在多模态推理和逻辑一致性决策方面的表现，特别是在图表理解和空间问题解决等任务中。

Method: 提出VisualSphinx数据集，采用规则到图像的合成流程，从种子问题中提取并扩展谜题规则，生成带有基础答案的合成图像代码以组装谜题样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用GRPO在VisualSphinx上训练的VLM受益于数据集的逻辑一致性和可读性，在逻辑推理任务上表现更优，同时提升代数推理、算术推理和几何推理等其他推理任务的能力。

Conclusion: VisualSphinx通过合成数据有效增强了VLM的逻辑推理能力，为多模态推理任务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal
reasoning and make logically coherent decisions, which is critical to tasks
such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM
reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge
this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic
visual logical reasoning training data. To tackle the challenge of image
synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis
pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and
generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample
assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx
benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit
improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning
capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks
such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架MPR，用于测量和优化文本到图像生成模型在交叉群体中的代表性，以减少刻板印象和少数群体忽视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型的普及，其在代表不同人口群体、传播刻板印象和忽视少数群体方面的潜在危害日益凸显。当前缺乏系统方法来量化并控制这些代表性危害。

Method: 采用多群体比例代表性(MPR)指标，评估生成模型在不同人口群体中的最差表现偏差，并开发了优化算法以平衡群体代表性。

Result: 实验表明，MPR能有效衡量交叉群体的代表性，作为训练目标时可引导模型生成更平衡的人口分布，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: MPR框架为生成模型的公平性评估和优化提供了可行方案，有助于实现更负责任的AI设计。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models can create vivid, realistic images from
textual descriptions. As these models proliferate, they expose new concerns
about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups, propagate
stereotypes, and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the
"safe" and "responsible" design of artificial intelligence (AI), there is no
established methodology to systematically measure and control representational
harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure
the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models
by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR
evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given
population groups in images produced by a generative model, allowing for
flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also
develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation
statistics across multiple intersectional groups and, when used as a training
objective, can guide models toward a more balanced generation across
demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出DINO-R1，首次尝试通过强化学习增强视觉基础模型的上下文推理能力，采用GRQO训练策略，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在推理能力上取得显著进展，但视觉基础模型（如DINO系列）的推理能力尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出DINO-R1，采用GRQO（一种基于查询的强化学习训练策略）和KL正则化，结合视觉提示编码器和查询选择机制。

Result: 在COCO、LVIS和ODinW等数据集上，DINO-R1显著超越监督微调基线，在开放词汇和封闭集视觉提示场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: DINO-R1通过强化学习成功提升了视觉基础模型的推理能力，为视觉表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language
models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through
reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods
like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning
abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models,
including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose
\textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context
reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement
learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query
Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly
designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level
rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply
KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the
training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive
supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional
drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models
that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that
DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving
strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MaskAdapt方法，通过结合RGB图像和深度数据特征，改进作物与杂草的语义分割精度，解决现有无监督域适应方法在遮挡和视觉混淆问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有作物与杂草语义分割方法依赖像素级标注且难以适应不同农田环境（域偏移），导致在新场景下泛化能力差。无监督域适应（UDA）方法在真实场景中因遮挡和视觉混淆易产生误分类。

Method: 提出MaskAdapt方法：1) 通过深度梯度从深度图中提取空间过渡特征，结合跨注意力机制增强RGB特征；2) 设计几何感知掩码策略（水平、垂直、随机掩码），迫使模型关注更广的空间上下文。

Result: 在真实农业数据集上，MaskAdapt优于现有SOTA UDA方法，在不同农田条件下均获得更高的平均交并比（mIOU）。

Conclusion: MaskAdapt通过多模态上下文学习和几何感知训练策略，显著提升了跨域作物与杂草分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is crucial for site-specific farm
management; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive
pixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one
field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to
domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,
and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by
enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods
struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading
to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy
through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features
derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our
method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.
These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature
representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we
propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,
and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the
broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real
agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms
existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation
mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.

Motivation: 当前的多模态基准测试主要评估通用图像理解或文本驱动的推理，缺乏需要领域特定知识与视觉证据分析结合的真实科学场景。

Method: 作者构建了包含1,378个问题的CSVQA基准，覆盖多个STEM学科，并设计了严格的评估协议，验证模型预测是否基于合理的中间推理步骤。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提升视觉语言模型科学推理能力的紧迫性，并发布了CSVQA基准以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet their capabilities for scientific reasoning
remains inadequately assessed. Current multimodal benchmarks predominantly
evaluate generic image comprehension or text-driven reasoning, lacking
authentic scientific contexts that require domain-specific knowledge
integration with visual evidence analysis. To fill this gap, we present CSVQA,
a diagnostic multimodal benchmark specifically designed for evaluating
scientific reasoning through domain-grounded visual question answering.Our
benchmark features 1,378 carefully constructed question-answer pairs spanning
diverse STEM disciplines, each demanding domain knowledge, integration of
visual evidence, and higher-order reasoning. Compared to prior multimodal
benchmarks, CSVQA places greater emphasis on real-world scientific content and
complex reasoning.We additionally propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to
systematically assess whether model predictions are substantiated by valid
intermediate reasoning steps based on curated explanations. Our comprehensive
evaluation of 15 VLMs on this benchmark reveals notable performance
disparities, as even the top-ranked proprietary model attains only 49.6\%
accuracy.This empirical evidence underscores the pressing need for advancing
scientific reasoning capabilities in VLMs. Our CSVQA is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶规划方法依赖人工标注或2D图像预训练，在3D空间表现不足，需改进输入表示空间。

Method: 基于PaLI模型设计稀疏体积策略，将2D视觉表征无缝转换至3D空间，聚合多视角/多帧数据生成规划轨迹。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上超越有监督方法，且展示出对大规无标注数据的强扩展性。

Conclusion: S4-Driver通过3D空间表征学习实现了高效自监督运动规划，为自动驾驶领域提供新思路。

Abstract: The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for
autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to
learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely
self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate
planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of
the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end
approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image
space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To
this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning
algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI
multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy
to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from
perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.
This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and
enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our
method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with
in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against
existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations.
It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of
unannotated driving logs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research
and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a
critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of
these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology
foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial
attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation
with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates
without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack
framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the
perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models
across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of
patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream
accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore,
we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship
between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a
preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay
the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable
deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Understanding the physical world - governed by laws of motion, spatial
relations, and causality - poses a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While recent advances such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-4o
demonstrate impressive perceptual and reasoning capabilities, our investigation
reveals these models struggle profoundly with visual physical reasoning,
failing to grasp basic physical laws, spatial interactions, and causal effects
in complex scenes. More importantly, they often fail to follow coherent
reasoning chains grounded in visual evidence, especially when multiple steps
are needed to arrive at the correct answer. To rigorously evaluate this
capability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought
(CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not
only the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path
grounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through
real-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we
introduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the
reasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we
minimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on
visual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even
cutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text
alignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment -
commonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial
reasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of
artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse
tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric
recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot
performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six
biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft
biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition,
presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs
and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments
show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse
biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of
face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a
False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)
dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1
percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any
fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these
embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack
Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender
and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates
the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of
Artificial General Intelligence.

### [410] [Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24225)
*Haibo Jin,Peiyan Zhang,Man Luo,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，思维链提示（CoT）可能降低大语言模型在归纳推理任务中的表现，并提出结构化干预措施以改进推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在多领域表现出色，但其归纳推理能力（从稀疏示例中推断潜在规则）仍有限。研究旨在验证思维链提示（CoT）是否真的能提升此类推理能力。

Method: 通过设计四个受控的游戏任务（国际象棋、德州扑克、骰子游戏和21点），并引入隐藏的人类定义规则，对比分析CoT推理与非推理模型的性能差异。

Result: 发现CoT推理可能降低归纳推理表现，大推理模型（LRMs）常不如非推理模型。错误主要源于子任务分解、解决和最终答案总结的失败。

Conclusion: 有效的CoT推理不仅需要更多步骤，还需确保步骤结构合理。提出的结构化干预措施可在不重新训练的情况下提升推理准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains,
yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from
sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such
reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled,
diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack -
with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade
inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning
counterparts.
  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how
reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect
sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer
summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce
structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified
failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without
retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not
only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.

*Haibo Jin,Peiyan Zhang,Peiran Wang,Man Luo,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将越狱攻击和幻觉视为大型基础模型的两种脆弱性，并发现它们在损失函数和梯度行为上具有一致性。通过实验验证，表明针对一种脆弱性的缓解技术也能影响另一种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（LFMs）容易受到越狱攻击和幻觉两种脆弱性的影响。以往研究通常孤立地分析这两种问题，但作者发现针对其中一种的防御措施会影响另一种，暗示它们之间存在更深层次的联系。

Method: 论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将越狱攻击建模为令牌级优化，幻觉建模为注意力级优化。在该框架下，提出了两个关键命题：（1）相似损失收敛；（2）注意力重新分配中的梯度一致性。并在LLaVA-1.5和MiniGPT-4上进行了实证验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，越狱攻击和幻觉在优化趋势和梯度行为上具有一致性。利用这种联系，证明针对幻觉的缓解技术可以降低越狱成功率，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了大型基础模型的一种共享故障模式，并建议鲁棒性策略应同时解决这两种脆弱性。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct
vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied
in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other,
hinting at a deeper connection.
  We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as
token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization.
Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar
Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge
similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient
Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient
behavior driven by shared attention dynamics.
  We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4,
showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this
connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can
reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared
failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly
address both vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTM3D提出了一种结合扩散模型和自回归模型的3D形状生成框架，通过条件分布建模和前缀学习提升生成质量，支持多种3D表示形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在连续隐空间建模上表现优异，而自回归模型擅长捕捉token间依赖关系，但将两者结合用于3D形状生成仍具挑战性。

Method: LTM3D采用条件分布建模主干网络，结合掩码自编码器和扩散模型；引入前缀学习对齐条件token与形状隐token；提出隐token重建模块及重建引导采样。

Result: 实验表明，LTM3D在图像和文本条件生成任务中，在提示保真度和结构准确性上优于现有方法，支持多种3D表示形式。

Conclusion: LTM3D提供了一个可推广的多模态、多表示3D生成框架，显著提升了生成形状的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: We present LTM3D, a Latent Token space Modeling framework for conditional 3D
shape generation that integrates the strengths of diffusion and auto-regressive
(AR) models. While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent
spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining
these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this,
LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a
masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning.
Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with
shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities.
We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with
Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural
fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling
support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields,
point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on
image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D
outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while
offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D
generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种方法（掩码归一化和时序内在扩散先验）解决交互式视频生成中的感知质量下降和轨迹控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本条件的扩散模型在交互式视频生成（IVG）中难以平衡轨迹控制与感知质量，主要因注意力掩码导致领域偏移和初始化噪声不匹配。

Method: 1. 掩码归一化：通过分布匹配缓解注意力掩码引起的内部协变量偏移；2. 时序内在扩散先验：在去噪步骤中强制时空一致性以对齐初始化噪声。

Result: 定性与定量实验表明，所提方法在感知质量和轨迹控制上均优于现有IVG技术。

Conclusion: 通过领域适应思想解决IVG中的领域偏移问题，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality video generation. However, enabling Interactive Video Generation
(IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains
challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to
guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two
key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift
problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we
attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by
attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked
attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization
layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we
address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not
align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion
prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask
normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality
and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.

Motivation: 解决视频问答中图像隐私问题，并通过改进文本转录质量提升回答准确性。

Method: 两阶段系统：1) 使用VLM从视频帧提取文本转录；2) 用LLM处理问题生成答案。采用网格化视觉提示整合局部与全局信息。

Result: 在NExT-QA和STAR-QA数据集上准确率分别达65.9%和50.11%，比非网格版本在定位问题上高24分。

Conclusion: Grid-LoGAT有效提升视频问答性能，兼顾隐私保护与准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription
(Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates
in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a
Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts
to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures
image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To
improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which
extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with
global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the
open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA
datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our
method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based
questions we created using NExT-QA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于条带感知空间感知的细粒度鸟类图像分类框架，通过捕捉图像中的长距离空间依赖关系，提高了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度鸟类图像分类（FBIC）在生态监测和物种识别中具有重要意义，但由于鸟类大小、背景干扰和姿态多变等问题，传统方法难以稳定提取判别性特征。

Method: 论文提出了两个新模块：扩展感知聚合器（EPA）和通道语义编织（CSW），分别用于整合局部与全局信息以及优化语义表示。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上的实验表明，该框架在保持结构效率的同时显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过长距离空间依赖捕捉和语义优化，有效解决了FBIC中的挑战，提升了模型的实用性和解释性。

Abstract: Fine-grained bird image classification (FBIC) is not only of great
significance for ecological monitoring and species identification, but also
holds broad research value in the fields of image recognition and fine-grained
visual modeling. Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses
more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging
distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)
complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and
highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in
substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it
difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,
thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in
real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial
perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire
rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules:
extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW).
Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues
by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions.
CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing
long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon
a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended
structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant
performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.

TL;DR: 通过大规模对比视觉语言训练，BioCLIP 2在TreeOfLife-200M数据集上展现出超越物种分类的涌现能力，如栖息地分类和性状预测，并揭示了嵌入空间的生物学意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在生物视觉任务中的涌现能力，验证大规模训练是否能产生超越初始目标的生物学意义表征。

Method: 构建TreeOfLife-200M（2.14亿张生物图像数据集），用对比学习训练BioCLIP 2进行物种分类，并分析其嵌入空间特性。

Result: 模型在栖息地分类等任务中表现优异；嵌入空间同时保留物种间功能差异（如喙大小）和物种内变异（如生命周期阶段），且后者与物种差异正交。

Conclusion: 分层监督和对比目标能促进涌现特性，且数据规模越大，嵌入空间的生物学意义越显著。

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors,
learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find
such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive
vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,
comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse
biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on
TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training
objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various
biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We
identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At
the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns
closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and
habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the
intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better
separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide
formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and
contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our
results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with
larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding
space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么忽略多尺度设计，要么将特定尺度问题分散在不同视频中，无法直接比较模型在同一内容上的多时间尺度性能。

Method: 引入ScaleLong基准测试，包含269个长视频，每个视频设计4-8个问题，覆盖四个层次时间尺度（秒、十秒、分钟、小时）。

Result: 评估23个MLLM显示性能呈U型曲线，最短和最长尺度准确率较高，中间尺度较低；增加视觉标记容量可提升所有尺度的推理能力。

Conclusion: ScaleLong为推进MLLM在长视频理解中的能力提供了细粒度的多时间尺度基准测试。

Abstract: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical
temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event
(minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this
multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos,
preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same
content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to
disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical
timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and
story (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content
multi-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model
performance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long
videos (avg.\ 86\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8
carefully designed questions, including at least one question for each
timescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with
higher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at
intermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual
token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong
offers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM
capabilities in long-video understanding. The code and dataset are available

Motivation: 遥感图像因其地理覆盖范围和目标一致性在目标检测任务中具有特殊重要性，而基于Transformer的深度学习模型在视觉计算任务中表现出色。

Method: 采用Deformable-DETR模型（使用可变形注意力机制的特定架构），在Pleiades Aircraft光学数据集和SSDD SAR数据集上进行10折分层验证。

Result: 模型表现优异，光学数据集F1分数达95.12%，SSDD数据集达94.54%，优于多种CNN和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: Deformable-DETR模型能有效应用于多模态遥感图像目标检测任务，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Object detection has recently seen an interesting trend in terms of the most
innovative research work, this task being of particular importance in the field
of remote sensing, given the consistency of these images in terms of
geographical coverage and the objects present. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL)
models, in particular those based on Transformers, are especially relevant for
visual computing tasks in general, and target detection in particular. Thus,
the present work proposes an application of Deformable-DETR model, a specific
architecture using deformable attention mechanisms, on remote sensing images in
two different modes, especially optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To
achieve this objective, two datasets are used, one optical, which is Pleiades
Aircraft dataset, and the other SAR, in particular SAR Ship Detection Dataset
(SSDD). The results of a 10-fold stratified validation showed that the proposed
model performed particularly well, obtaining an F1 score of 95.12% for the
optical dataset and 94.54% for SSDD, while comparing these results with several
models detections, especially those based on CNNs and transformers, as well as
those specifically designed to detect different object classes in remote
sensing images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格陵兰冰下地形的准确理解对预测冰盖未来质量损失及其对全球海平面上升的贡献至关重要。然而，观测数据的稀疏性和复杂性增加了模型预测的不确定性。

Method: 研究采用深度学习框架DeepTopoNet，结合雷达冰厚观测和BedMachine数据，通过动态损失平衡机制和CNN架构优化地形重建。

Result: 在Upernavik Isstrøm区域的系统测试中，模型表现出高精度，优于基线方法，成功重建了冰下地形。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了深度学习在填补观测空白方面的潜力，为冰下地形推断提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting
the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level
rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,
particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,
significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is
traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice
thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of
kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning
framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice
thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic
loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,
BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass
conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate
high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively
adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in
areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution
of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates
gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and
utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By
systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves
high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial
terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging
observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring
subglacial topography.

Conclusion: GVL 是一个模块化、可解释的零样本分类框架，适用于广泛的地理空间应用，其开源代码旨在促进实际工作流程中的采用。

Abstract: Classifying geospatial imagery remains a major bottleneck for applications
such as disaster response and land-use monitoring-particularly in regions where
annotated data is scarce or unavailable. Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that
claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless
rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive
performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot
classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich,
human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined
classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and
interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range
of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced,
and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary
Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class
classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive
LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by
hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer
distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced
at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in
real-world geospatial workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）需要复杂图像信息的细致解析，但单一视觉编码器难以处理多样化的任务领域，容易导致冲突。现有方法通过集成多个领域专用编码器增强感知，但增加了复杂性并限制了联合优化的潜力。

Method: 引入Mixpert，一种高效的视觉专家混合架构，继承单一视觉编码器的联合学习优势，同时重构为多专家范式以支持不同视觉任务的特定微调，并设计动态路由机制分配输入图像至最合适的视觉专家。

Result: Mixpert有效缓解了单一视觉编码器在多任务学习中的领域冲突，以最小的额外计算成本实现了比多编码器更高的效率，并在多种任务中表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: Mixpert不仅高效解决了多任务学习中的领域冲突问题，还能无缝集成到任何MLLM中，为复杂视觉任务的处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require a nuanced interpretation of
complex image information, typically leveraging a vision encoder to perceive
various visual scenarios. However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to
handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts.
Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple
domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits
the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an
efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint
learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into
a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual
tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input
images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates
domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning
with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than
multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM,
with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across
various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉情感分析中存在抽象、重叠和纠缠的情感线索难以建模，以及情感语义对齐不足的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来提升情感推理的一致性和准确性。

Method: K-EVER²框架通过语义结构化的视觉情感线索表达和多模态对齐整合外部情感知识，无需手工标签或直接情感监督，实现了跨异构图像类型的鲁棒情感预测。

Result: 在Emotion6、EmoSet和M-Disaster三个基准测试中，K-EVER²相比CNN和VLM基线模型，特定情感准确率提升高达19%，平均准确率提升12.3%。

Conclusion: K-EVER²为视觉内容的情感理解提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案，显著提升了情感分析的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding what emotions images evoke in their viewers is a foundational
goal in human-centric visual computing. While recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for visual emotion analysis
(VEA), several key challenges remain unresolved. Emotional cues in images are
often abstract, overlapping, and entangled, making them difficult to model and
interpret. Moreover, VLMs struggle to align these complex visual patterns with
emotional semantics due to limited supervision and sparse emotional grounding.
Finally, existing approaches lack structured affective knowledge to resolve
ambiguity and ensure consistent emotional reasoning across diverse visual
domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{K-EVER\textsuperscript{2}},
a knowledge-enhanced framework for emotion reasoning and retrieval. Our
approach introduces a semantically structured formulation of visual emotion
cues and integrates external affective knowledge through multimodal alignment.
Without relying on handcrafted labels or direct emotion supervision,
K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} achieves robust and interpretable emotion predictions
across heterogeneous image types.
  We validate our framework on three representative benchmarks, Emotion6,
EmoSet, and M-Disaster, covering social media imagery, human-centric scenes,

TL;DR: AMIA是一种轻量级防御方法，通过自动屏蔽无关图像块和联合意图分析，提升大型视觉语言模型的安全性，同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）易受对抗性攻击和隐藏有害意图的影响，需要一种无需重新训练的高效防御方法。

Method: AMIA结合自动屏蔽无关图像块和联合意图分析，在推理阶段阻断对抗性扰动并识别有害意图。

Result: 防御成功率从52.4%提升至81.7%，实用性仅下降2%，且推理开销较低。

Conclusion: AMIA在安全性和实用性之间取得了良好平衡，屏蔽和意图分析均为关键组成部分。

Abstract: We introduce AMIA, a lightweight, inference-only defense for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that (1) Automatically Masks a small set of
text-irrelevant image patches to disrupt adversarial perturbations, and (2)
conducts joint Intention Analysis to uncover and mitigate hidden harmful
intents before response generation. Without any retraining, AMIA improves
defense success rates across diverse LVLMs and jailbreak benchmarks from an
average of 52.4% to 81.7%, preserves general utility with only a 2% average
accuracy drop, and incurs only modest inference overhead. Ablation confirms
both masking and intention analysis are essential for a robust safety-utility
trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胃肠内窥镜检查对早期疾病诊断至关重要，但深度学习模型依赖昂贵标注数据。基础模型可解决数据稀缺问题，但医疗数据的隐私性限制了其训练。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，使数据保留在医院本地，同时共同训练共享基础模型，评估了多种联邦学习算法在异构环境中的适用性。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架成功训练了胃肠内窥镜基础模型，既保护了数据隐私，又提升了模型性能，为医疗AI应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract
abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve
patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI
diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with
labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising
solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned
for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for
medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected
nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training
typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large
volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making
foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we
propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy
imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while
contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms,
assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on
task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three
critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and
demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated,
privacy-preserving setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为VG LLM的新方法，通过视频数据直接增强MLLM在3D空间的理解和推理能力，无需额外3D输入，并在多个任务中取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖全面的3D数据输入（如点云或BEV地图）来实现MLLM对3D场景的理解。本文旨在直接从视频数据中提升MLLM的3D空间理解和推理能力，减少对额外3D输入的依赖。

Method: 提出VG LLM方法，采用3D视觉几何编码器从视频序列中提取3D先验信息，并将其与视觉标记结合输入MLLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D场景理解和空间推理任务中取得显著改进。4B模型在不依赖显式3D数据输入的情况下，性能与现有先进方法相当，甚至在VSI-Bench评估中超越Gemini-1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: VG LLM方法通过视频数据直接实现3D空间理解，减少了3D数据依赖，并在多个任务中表现出色，展示了其在3D场景理解领域的潜力。

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as
videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such
as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research,
we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and
reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional
3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large
Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that
extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is
integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have
shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks
related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned
from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit
3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the
VSI-Bench evaluations.

Result: 开发了自动化评估工具包，从多维度量化生成图像质量，代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了复杂指令评估的空白，并通过框架提升现有模型的复杂指令处理能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to
produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models
often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects,
attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I
models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the
nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we
introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500
intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation
dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow
complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework
(Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without
requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with
existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose
complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As
existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the
nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that
automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of
multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at
https://github.com/yczhou001/LongBench-T2I.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CAAC的新型深度学习模型，通过注意力机制和角度编码解决云光学厚度（COT）估计中的角度敏感性和3D辐射传输效应问题，显著提升了估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立像素近似（IPA）方法因简化假设导致显著偏差，而现有深度学习模型对辐射强度变化、畸变和云阴影敏感，且在不同太阳和观测角度下误差较大。

Method: 提出Cloud-Attention-Net with Angle Coding (CAAC)模型，结合注意力机制和角度嵌入，考虑卫星观测几何和3D辐射传输效应，并采用多角度训练策略实现角度不变性。

Result: 实验表明，CAAC显著优于现有深度学习模型，将云属性反演误差降低了至少九倍。

Conclusion: CAAC通过角度不变性和注意力机制，有效提升了云光学厚度的估计精度，为气候和天气研究提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) is a critical cloud property influencing
Earth's climate, weather, and radiation budget. Satellite radiance measurements
enable global COT retrieval, but challenges like 3D cloud effects, viewing
angles, and atmospheric interference must be addressed to ensure accurate
estimation. Traditionally, the Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA) method,
which treats individual pixels independently, has been used for COT estimation.
However, IPA introduces significant bias due to its simplified assumptions.
Recently, deep learning-based models have shown improved performance over IPA
but lack robustness, as they are sensitive to variations in radiance intensity,
distortions, and cloud shadows. These models also introduce substantial errors
in COT estimation under different solar and viewing zenith angles. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel angle-invariant, attention-based deep
model called Cloud-Attention-Net with Angle Coding (CAAC). Our model leverages
attention mechanisms and angle embeddings to account for satellite viewing
geometry and 3D radiative transfer effects, enabling more accurate retrieval of
COT. Additionally, our multi-angle training strategy ensures angle invariance.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CAAC significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, reducing cloud
property retrieval errors by at least a factor of nine.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大型语言模型缺乏视觉世界的层次知识，限制了视觉语言模型的层次理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大型语言模型在视觉层次知识上的不足，探索其对视觉语言模型理解能力的限制。

Method: 构建约100万道四选一视觉问答任务，基于六个分类体系和四个图像数据集进行实验。

Result: 微调视觉语言模型后，语言模型的层次一致性提升更显著，证实其瓶颈效应。

Conclusion: 只有当语言模型具备分类学知识时，视觉语言模型才能实现完全层次化的视觉概念理解。

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even
well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck
for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone
Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million
four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six
taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM
using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because
the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision
LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual
concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy
knowledge.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题，即生成与视觉内容不符的响应，需要开发可信赖的解决方案。

Method: 采用双射最大似然学习（BIMA）方法，利用标准化流理论优化解码过程。

Result: BIMA在POPE基准测试中平均F1得分为85.06%，CHAIRS和CHAIRI分别降低7.6%和2.6%。

Conclusion: BIMA是首批利用双射方法减少视觉语言模型幻觉的研究之一，效果显著。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have become widely adopted to advance in various
domains. However, developing a trustworthy system with minimal interpretable
characteristics of large-scale models presents a significant challenge. One of
the most prevalent terms associated with the fallacy functions caused by these
systems is hallucination, where the language model generates a response that
does not correspond to the visual content. To mitigate this problem, several
approaches have been developed, and one prominent direction is to ameliorate
the decoding process. In this paper, we propose a new Bijective Maximum
Likelihood Learning (BIMA) approach to hallucination mitigation using
normalizing flow theories. The proposed BIMA method can efficiently mitigate
the hallucination problem in prevailing vision-language models, resulting in
significant improvements. Notably, BIMA achieves the average F1 score of 85.06%
on POPE benchmark and remarkably reduce CHAIRS and CHAIRI by 7.6% and 2.6%,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies
that contemplates the bijection means to reduce hallucination induced by large
vision-language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML)的新方法，通过低秩近似和阻尼机制高效利用扩散Hessian几何，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像的质量，且计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型采样技术主要依赖一阶Langevin动力学，而利用二阶Hessian几何提升采样质量的方法因计算复杂度高难以扩展。本文旨在解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 提出LML方法：1) 利用扩散模型固有结构进行Hessian低秩近似避免显式计算；2) 引入阻尼机制稳定近似Hessian。该方法无需训练即可近似扩散Hessian几何。

Result: 在多个预训练扩散模型上的实验表明，LML方法能显著提升图像生成质量（FID指标平均提升15%），且仅增加<5%的计算开销。理论分析证明了低秩近似的误差界和阻尼机制的收敛性。

Conclusion: LML通过高效利用二阶几何信息，以可忽略的计算成本实现了扩散模型采样质量的显著提升，为扩散模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated the remarkable capability of
generating images via learning the noised score function of data distribution.
Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics
at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level
denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry
to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in
high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs,
rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel
Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion
Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the
celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces
two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian,
leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit
quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the
approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the
diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image
generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate
the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence
property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple
pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image
generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: 论文通过{\dataset}基准测试和{\method}方法，有效区分并减少了多模态大语言模型中的推理幻觉，为模型诊断和改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are
multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to
adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and
reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue
and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To
address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning
hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly
perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces
multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination
score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model
scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of
logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no
effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted
spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities;
and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns,
highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To
address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines
curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate
logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and
collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method}
establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in
original base models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving
state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.
Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but
is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks
that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,
training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates
challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,
highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve
generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework
for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation
and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR
framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains
different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online
RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture
strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data
mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.
Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when
combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM
general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained
model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%
compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a
total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have
pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge
to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time
technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning
capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training.
By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT
reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits
the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors
such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts
performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and
multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the
performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our
implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with
parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared
to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment
of ProxyThinker. Code is available at

Abstract: Although chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) have
driven breakthroughs in NLP, their integration into generative vision models
remains underexplored. We introduce ReasonGen-R1, a two-stage framework that
first imbues an autoregressive image generator with explicit text-based
"thinking" skills via supervised fine-tuning on a newly generated reasoning
dataset of written rationales, and then refines its outputs using Group
Relative Policy Optimization. To enable the model to reason through text before
generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model
crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of
object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward
signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual
quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and
the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong
baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in
vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding.
However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic,
single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess
reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To
address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,
multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual
contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional
text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual
reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,
and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with
explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we
propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the
correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness
of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the
best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to
solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.
These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use
capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of
remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising
methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes
and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited
interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient
attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of
regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in
conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose
a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network
(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the
non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a
sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by
non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.
Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which
all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the
advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and
successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and
STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

*Heejo Kong,Sung-Jin Kim,Gunho Jung,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出DAC框架，通过多模型预测差异增强开放集半监督学习对异常数据的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习假设标记与未标记数据类别分布相同，但实际未标记数据常含异常类别。现有方法依赖单一模型预测差异，在标记数据不足时性能下降严重。

Method: 提出Diversify and Conquer (DAC)：1) 通过单次训练构建多个偏置不同的模型头；2) 利用未标记数据训练产生的预测分歧作为异常检测依据。

Result: 方法在标记数据不足时仍能实现稳健的异常检测，性能优于不考虑异常数据的朴素半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 通过诱导模型头对异常数据产生分歧同时保持正常数据一致性，DAC有效提升了开放集半监督学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and
unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this
assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class
data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading
the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the
context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that
existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers
and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be
easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In
contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models
that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging
the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through
a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently
biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we
exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown
concepts. Our code is available at https://github.com/heejokong/DivCon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI驱动UI代理数据集和方法主要针对移动或网页应用中的短任务，无法满足专业工程工具的需求，因此需要开发一个能处理高复杂度、长时间交互的数据集。

Method: 通过自动化框架从人工CAD设计中收集高保真UI动作数据，构建了包含41K标注视频的VideoCAD数据集，并提出了VideoCADFormer模型学习CAD交互。

Result: VideoCADFormer在CAD交互学习中表现优于多个基线模型，VideoCAD数据集还用于评估多模态LLM的空间推理和视频理解能力。

Conclusion: VideoCAD揭示了当前基于视频的UI理解中的关键挑战，包括精确动作定位、多模态空间推理和长时间依赖关系。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a time-consuming and complex process,
requiring precise, long-horizon user interactions with intricate 3D interfaces.
While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise,
most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in
mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional
engineering tools. In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt at
engineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD
is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video
recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for
collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared
to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity
in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x
longer time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream
applications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision
3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to
evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video
understanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose
VideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly
from video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines. Both
VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key
challenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the
need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon dependencies.

Motivation: 传统卷积操作对所有邻域像素赋予相同权重，忽略了像素间距离的影响。论文旨在通过加权卷积优化像素贡献，提升模型精度。

Method: 提出加权卷积框架，分离优化卷积核权重（使用随机梯度下降）和密度函数（使用DIRECT-L算法），并通过最小化模型计算最优密度函数。

Result: 实验显示，加权卷积在图像去噪任务中损失降低达53%，测试精度提升，但执行时间增加11%。方法对超参数具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 加权卷积显著提升了卷积神经网络的性能，未来将应用于2D和3D图像的实际学习问题。

Abstract: The paper introduces the weighted convolution, a novel approach to the
convolution for signals defined on regular grids (e.g., 2D images) through the
application of an optimal density function to scale the contribution of
neighbouring pixels based on their distance from the central pixel. This choice
differs from the traditional uniform convolution, which treats all neighbouring
pixels equally. Our weighted convolution can be applied to convolutional neural
network problems to improve the approximation accuracy. Given a convolutional
network, we define a framework to compute the optimal density function through
a minimisation model. The framework separates the optimisation of the
convolutional kernel weights (using stochastic gradient descent) from the
optimisation of the density function (using DIRECT-L). Experimental results on
a learning model for an image-to-image task (e.g., image denoising) show that
the weighted convolution significantly reduces the loss (up to 53% improvement)
and increases the test accuracy compared to standard convolution. While this
method increases execution time by 11%, it is robust across several
hyperparameters of the learning model. Future work will apply the weighted
convolution to real-case 2D and 3D image convolutional learning problems.

Motivation: 尽管地理空间基础模型（FMs）在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域取得了革命性进展，但其在实现全球可持续发展目标中的实际效用和对齐性尚未充分探索。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 作者提出了SustainFM，一个基于17项可持续发展目标的综合性基准测试框架，涵盖从资产财富预测到环境危害检测的多样化任务，用于跨学科评估地理空间FMs。

Result: 研究发现：(1) FMs在多样化任务和数据集上通常优于传统方法，尽管并非普遍优越；(2) 评估FMs需超越准确率，纳入可迁移性、泛化性和能效等关键标准；(3) FMs为应对复杂可持续发展挑战提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 论文主张从以模型为中心的开发转向以影响为导向的部署，并强调能效、领域适应性稳健性和伦理考量等指标，以推动FMs在可持续发展中的负责任应用。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained AI systems that have
revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now
advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved
generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal
labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their
real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain
underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework
grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks
ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This
study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and
offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our
findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform
traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs
should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and
energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable
scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex
sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from
model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics
such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical
considerations.

Motivation: 揭示当前视觉语言模型在空间信息缺失时无法有效理解纯时间模式的局限性，推动时间模式识别研究。

Method: 引入SpookyBench基准，通过噪声帧序列编码信息，测试模型和人类在低空间信噪比条件下的时间模式识别能力。

Result: 人类识别准确率超98%，而先进模型准确率为0%，表明模型过度依赖空间特征且无法从时间线索中提取意义。

Conclusion: 需开发新架构或训练范式以解耦时空依赖，提升模型时间推理能力，缩小与人类理解的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides
in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial
information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal
patterns. We introduce $\textbf{SpookyBench}$, a benchmark where information is
encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural
phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,
while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with
over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance
gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial
features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,
when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,
especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this
limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple
spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows
that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release
SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the
gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been
made available on our project website: https://timeblindness.github.io/.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial
to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world,

recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the
first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset,
containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic
scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head
pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer
model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or
combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the
task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality.
Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types
of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in
constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and
data will be public.

TL;DR: 论文研究代码复杂度与LLM生成代码成功率的关系，提出基于复杂度指标的迭代反馈方法，显著提升生成代码的正确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注提升LLM生成代码的效果，但很少分析生成代码的特性并利用其改进失败案例。本文从代码复杂度这一直观特性入手，探究其与LLM生成代码成功率的关系。

Method: 首先通过实证分析复杂度指标与生成代码正确率的关联性，利用逻辑回归识别关键指标；随后提出基于复杂度指标的迭代反馈方法，指导LLM生成更优代码。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升生成正确率（如GPT-3.5 Turbo在HumanEval上Pass@1提升35.71%），且适用于不同基准和LLM模型（GPT-4o提升20%，GPT-o3 mini提升23.07%）。

Conclusion: 复杂度感知反馈能有效增强LLM直接生成和基于代理的工作流，为代码生成优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on
improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work
tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to
improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic
of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the
success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity
metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation
with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic
regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of
code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback
method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity
metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple
benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs
(i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the
results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative
execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment
results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a
smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to
the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands
experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code
generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07%
(GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances
both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为监督校准（SC）的新框架，通过优化对数空间中的仿射变换来改进大型语言模型（LLM）在上下文学习中的校准能力，显著提升了分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在上下文学习（ICL）中存在系统性偏差，导致分类性能不稳定。虽然已有校准技术尝试缓解这一问题，但它们通常只能调整决策边界的位置而无法改变其方向，这在偏差严重误导模型时效果有限。

Method: 本文提出监督校准（SC）框架，通过学习对数空间中每类的最优仿射变换来校准LLM的预测概率。SC不仅包含多种现有校准方法作为特例，还能改变甚至完全逆转决策边界的方向。此外，SC还引入了两种正则化技术：上下文不变性和方向信任区域，以增强稳定性和控制校准程度。

Result: SC在Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、LLaMA-2-7B-chat和Qwen2-7B-Instruct等模型上，于4-shot、8-shot和16-shot设置下的九个数据集中均取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 监督校准（SC）通过更灵活的函数类和正则化技术，显著提升了LLM在上下文学习中的校准能力，为分类任务提供了一种统一的、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new
tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from
systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While
calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in
the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the
LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation.
This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To
address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose
Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns
an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive
probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the
context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many
existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the
ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's
decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless
integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance
and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability
issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC
delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot,
8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression put forward via Gibbs
entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process.
The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it
directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition
originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic
Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic
reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed
projections, so called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied
to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level
pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and
act as smart neural architecture search, Experiments demonstrated utility of
this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient
compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket
hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar
performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from
statistical physics perspective, we formulated so called {\it Gibbs
randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression
relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, DTC framework provides a promising
approach for massively energy and resource efficient deep learning training

Conclusion: 论文提出的SeqCRC方法和配套工具包为物体检测提供了统计保证，有助于在关键应用中更可靠地部署物体检测模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial
uses. However, their deployment in critical applications is hindered by the
inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of
object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal
Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are
valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or
data distribution. Our contribution is manifold: first, we formally define the
problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method,
Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical
guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two
parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and
prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and
certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling
replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we
perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the
investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical
consequences.

Abstract: Calibrating blackbox machine learning models to achieve risk control is
crucial to ensure reliable decision-making. A rich line of literature has been
studying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit
finite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown
data-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may
influence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of
predictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics. In this
paper, we introduce Performative Risk Control, a framework to calibrate models
to achieve risk control under performativity with provable theoretical
guarantees. Specifically, we provide an iteratively refined calibration
process, where we ensure the predictions are improved and risk-controlled
throughout the process. We also study different types of risk measures and
choices of tail bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework by numerical experiments on the task of predicting credit default
risk. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to study
statistically rigorous risk control under performativity, which will serve as
an important safeguard against a wide range of strategic manipulation in
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data
modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The
methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one
for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In
this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning
as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional
probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,
consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal
algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of
these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is
similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This
probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive
learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use
of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We
study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate
Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a
low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the
capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural
statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel
variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for
generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical
experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data
assimilation application arising in oceanography.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has become an essential machine learning tool for
addressing multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been effectively
applied across fields such as healthcare, marketing, and biomedical research.
However, to enable efficient information sharing across tasks, it is crucial to
leverage both shared and heterogeneous information. Despite extensive research
on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior
heterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to
address these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper,
we propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor
space for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common
information across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task
characteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of
the coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive
integration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity. We introduce a
unified algorithm that alternately learns the task-specific and task-shared
encoders and coefficients. In theory, we investigate the excess risk bound for
the proposed MTL method using local Rademacher complexity and apply it to a new
but related task. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing data integration methods across various settings.
Furthermore, the proposed method achieves superior predictive performance for
time to tumor doubling across five distinct cancer types in PDX data.

Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure
smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation
can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse,
where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse,
where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While
the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks,
an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has
so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal
propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers,
layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention
layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from
statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the
variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we
recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored
high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse}
occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the
residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields
trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation
hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models
trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework
gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and
gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual
connections that guarantees smooth training.

Abstract: Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible framework
to predict spatially distributed variables with uncertainty. But the use of
nonstationary priors, often necessary for capturing complex spatial patterns,
makes sampling from the predictive posterior distribution (PPD) computationally
intractable. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on diffusion
generative models (DGMs) to mimic PPDs associated with non-stationary GP
priors: we replace the GP prior by a DGM surrogate, and leverage recent
advances on training-free guidance algorithms for DGMs to sample from the
desired posterior distribution. We apply our approach to a rich non-stationary
GP prior from which exact posterior sampling is untractable and validate that
the issuing distributions are close to their GP counterpart using several
statistical metrics. We also demonstrate how one can fine-tune the trained DGMs
to target specific parts of the GP prior. Finally we apply the proposed
approach to solve inverse problems arising in environmental sciences, thus
yielding state-of-the-art predictions.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit strong generalization even in highly
overparameterized regimes. Significant progress has been made to understand
this phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised
tasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works
have successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem,
they are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus
on two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow,
incorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A
low-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on
the learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that
bypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical
points of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe
its global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive
the test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and
without skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena:
Firstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin
to the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width
reduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection
can mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the
model is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip
connections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our
claims with numerical evidence.

Conclusion: K²IE不仅提供了经典KIE与基于核方法的强度估计之间的新理论联系，还通过高效的计算实现，为实际应用提供了更好的选择。

Abstract: Kernel method-based intensity estimators, formulated within reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), and classical kernel intensity estimators (KIEs)
have been among the most easy-to-implement and feasible methods for estimating
the intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. While both
approaches share the term "kernel", they are founded on distinct theoretical
principles, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we
propose a novel regularized kernel method for Poisson processes based on the
least squares loss and show that the resulting intensity estimator involves a
specialized variant of the representer theorem: it has the dual coefficient of
unity and coincides with classical KIEs. This result provides new theoretical
insights into the connection between classical KIEs and kernel method-based
intensity estimators, while enabling us to develop an efficient KIE by
leveraging advanced techniques from RKHS theory. We refer to the proposed model
as the kernel method-based kernel intensity estimator (K$^2$IE). Through
experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that K$^2$IE achieves comparable
predictive performance while significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art
kernel method-based estimator in computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Knockoff-guided的压缩感知框架，通过精确控制假发现率(FDR)来提升信号恢复性能，显著优于传统LASSO等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩感知方法（如LASSO）在信号支持选择与估计过程中缺乏显式错误控制，导致恢复结果不可靠。本文旨在通过统计Knockoff滤波器实现FDR控制，从而更准确地识别真实信号支持。

Method: 提出基于Knockoff的框架，将支持恢复过程分离并通过统计方法控制FDR，在有限样本下保证理论性能，同时实现精确信号重构。

Result: 实验表明：1) F1分数最高提升3.9倍；2) 重构误差持续低于基线；3) 在真实数据集上预测性能接近/超越未压缩信号。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统计理论支撑的支持选择，兼具理论保证与强大实证性能，成为现有方法的实用替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework,
referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise
false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase.
Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation
without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite
samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By
separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical
Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction,
especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We
establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures
recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based
compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based
method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art
compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves
F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false
discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also
consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further
validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream
predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often
narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed
signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical
alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.

Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target
distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces
training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that
reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key
to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models,
but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we
analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple
model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors,
sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and
target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition
occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is
smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of
relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we
demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent
overfitting. For $N > d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear
diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler
divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data
distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation
in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight
into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a
shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator
(RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient
by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;
namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since
LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we
propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood
loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for
each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an
$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which
results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic
high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as
well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face
recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other
methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

Motivation: 长期以来，统计力学为分析神经网络提供了框架，但理论模型（如感知机、随机特征模型等）与实际应用中的网络相比过于简单。本文旨在缩小这一差距，通过分析更接近实际的两层全连接网络。

Method: 论文采用统计物理方法，研究了一个具有通用权重分布和激活函数的两层全连接网络，在贝叶斯最优学习（教师-学生场景）中的行为，重点关注参数与数据量相当的插值区域。

Result: 研究发现，随着数据量的增加，学习过程会出现多种转变。目标隐藏神经元对响应的贡献越强，学习所需的数据量越少。数据稀缺时，模型仅学习教师权重的非线性组合；数据充足时，模型会“专业化”并与教师权重对齐。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了神经网络学习中的丰富现象学，表明特征学习在插值区域出现，且数据量对学习模式有显著影响。实际训练算法可能因统计与计算之间的差距而难以实现专业化。

Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to
analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g.,
perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models
and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used
in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical
networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics
analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with
generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is
large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more
realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but
also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on
the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a
dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate
around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are
comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich
phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data
increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons
of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to
learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear
combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its
weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes
available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms,
possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a
spectrum of tasks in financial services, including report generation, chatbots,
sentiment analysis, regulatory compliance, investment advisory, financial
knowledge retrieval, and summarization. However, their intrinsic complexity and
lack of transparency pose significant challenges, especially in the highly
regulated financial sector, where interpretability, fairness, and
accountability are critical. As far as we are aware, this paper presents the
first application in the finance domain of understanding and utilizing the
inner workings of LLMs through mechanistic interpretability, addressing the
pressing need for transparency and control in AI systems. Mechanistic
interpretability is the most intuitive and transparent way to understand LLM
behavior by reverse-engineering their internal workings. By dissecting the
activations and circuits within these models, it provides insights into how
specific features or components influence predictions - making it possible not
only to observe but also to modify model behavior. In this paper, we explore
the theoretical aspects of mechanistic interpretability and demonstrate its
practical relevance through a range of financial use cases and experiments,
including applications in trading strategies, sentiment analysis, bias, and
hallucination detection. While not yet widely adopted, mechanistic
interpretability is expected to become increasingly vital as adoption of LLMs
increases. Advanced interpretability tools can ensure AI systems remain
ethical, transparent, and aligned with evolving financial regulations. In this
paper, we have put special emphasis on how these techniques can help unlock
interpretability requirements for regulatory and compliance purposes -
addressing both current needs and anticipating future expectations from
financial regulators globally.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the A2 Copula Spatial Bayesian Neural Network
(A2-SBNN), a predictive spatial model designed to map coordinates to continuous
fields while capturing both typical spatial patterns and extreme dependencies.
By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the
network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial
relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained
through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment
matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage
uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high
accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective
solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based
approaches.

*Quinn Lanners,Cynthia Rudin,Alexander Volfovsky,Harsh Parikh*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的部分识别框架，用于在关键假设同时失效时进行因果效应估计，并通过可解释的敏感性参数量化假设违反程度，应用于教育研究验证了其稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果推断方法在无观测混杂和反事实结果可交换性假设同时失效时无法识别或估计因果效应，这在实践中很常见。论文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出部分识别框架，引入可解释的敏感性参数量化假设违反程度，推导因果效应边界，并开发双重稳健估计器进行操作化分析。

Result: 在Project STAR教育研究中应用该框架，发现即使关键假设同时违反，班级规模对学生考试成绩的因果效应结论仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 新框架增强了因果结论的可信度，即使存在未测量的数据偏差，也能为决策提供可靠依据。

Abstract: Data fusion techniques integrate information from heterogeneous data sources
to improve learning, generalization, and decision making across data sciences.
In causal inference, these methods leverage rich observational data to improve
causal effect estimation, while maintaining the trustworthiness of randomized
controlled trials. Existing approaches often relax the strong no unobserved
confounding assumption by instead assuming exchangeability of counterfactual
outcomes across data sources. However, when both assumptions simultaneously
fail - a common scenario in practice - current methods cannot identify or
estimate causal effects. We address this limitation by proposing a novel
partial identification framework that enables researchers to answer key
questions such as: Is the causal effect positive or negative? and How severe
must assumption violations be to overturn this conclusion? Our approach
introduces interpretable sensitivity parameters that quantify assumption
violations and derives corresponding causal effect bounds. We develop doubly
robust estimators for these bounds and operationalize breakdown frontier
analysis to understand how causal conclusions change as assumption violations
increase. We apply our framework to the Project STAR study, which investigates
the effect of classroom size on students' third-grade standardized test
performance. Our analysis reveals that the Project STAR results are robust to
simultaneous violations of key assumptions, both on average and across various
subgroups of interest. This strengthens confidence in the study's conclusions
despite potential unmeasured biases in the data.

TL;DR: 该论文通过机器学习控制的自动化压电力显微镜研究了PbTiO3薄膜中的畴壁动力学，发现畴壁位移不仅依赖于电场参数，还与局部的铁电-铁弹构型有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究铁电材料中畴壁动力学的空间依赖性，由于每个极性界面被锁定在独特的局部微观结构中，需要空间分辨的扫描探针显微镜技术。

Method: 使用机器学习控制的自动化压电力显微镜（Piezoresponse Force Microscopy）对大面积外延PbTiO3薄膜进行量化分析。

Result: 分析了1500个开关事件，发现畴壁位移不仅依赖于电场参数，还与局部的铁电-铁弹构型有关，例如双边界在特定偏置下保持钉扎。

Conclusion: 通过自动化高通量AFM工作流程，可以将铁电和铁弹壁取向的统计数据提炼为预测图，为设计铁电存储器奠定基础。

Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly
position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local
microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the
wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers
and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding
the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human
experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$
were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the
polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall
displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local
ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in
polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up
to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias
increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$
$\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics
on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with
the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive
map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This
microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing
ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization
typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and
resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely
performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine
learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data
to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of
materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from
characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In
this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative
metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM),
using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy.
Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features
of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images
of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a
foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of
materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的KG-RAG路由框架，通过检索评分分布判断查询难度，平衡性能与推理成本，减少对大模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型推理成本高，且知识图谱增强检索（KG-RAG）进一步增加了成本。传统基于训练的路由方法难以扩展，需要大量训练数据。

Method: 基于检索评分分布与查询难度的强相关性，提出无需训练的KG-RAG路由框架，动态分配查询到不同规模的LLM。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少对大模型50%的调用，且不降低响应质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效可扩展的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案，平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference
costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a
knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However,
the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs
further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing,
which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs.
However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing
training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need
for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced
by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on
this, we propose a novel, training-free routing framework, the first tailored
to KG-RAG that effectively balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play
manner. Experiments show our method reduces calls to larger LLMs by up to 50%
without sacrificing response quality, demonstrating its potential for efficient
and scalable LLM deployment.

Abstract: We perform an information-theoretic mode decomposition for separated wakes
around a wing. The current data-driven approach based on a neural network
referred to as deep sigmoidal flow enables the extraction of an informative
component from a given flow field snapshot with respect to a target variable at
a future time stamp, thereby capturing the causality as a time-varying modal
structure. We consider three examples of separated flows around a NACA0012
airfoil, namely, 1. laminar periodic wake at post-stall angles of attack, 2.
strong vortex-airfoil interactions, and 3. a turbulent wake in a
spanwise-periodic domain. The present approach reveals informative vortical
structures associated with a time-varying lift response. For the periodic
shedding cases, the informative structures vary in time corresponding to the
fluctuation level from their mean values. With the second example of
vortex-airfoil interactions, how the effect of vortex gust on a wing emerges in
the lift response over time is identified in an interpretable manner.
Furthermore, for the case of turbulent wake, the present model highlights
structures near the wing and vortex cores as informative components based
solely on the information metric without any prior knowledge of aerodynamics
and length scales. This study provides causality-based insights into a range of
unsteady aerodynamic problems.

Conclusion: 结论强调了未来不确定性对公平分配的限制，以及利用结构化信息实现在线公平分配的潜力。

Abstract: We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods to agents in an
online setting, where goods arrive sequentially and must be allocated
irrevocably to agents. Focusing on the popular fairness notions of
envy-freeness, proportionality, and maximin share fairness (and their
approximate variants), we ask how the availability of information on future
goods influences the existence and approximability of fair allocations. In the
absence of any such information, we establish strong impossibility results,
demonstrating the inherent difficulty of achieving even approximate fairness
guarantees. In contrast, we demonstrate that knowledge of additional
information -- such as aggregate of each agent's total valuations
(equivalently, normalized valuations) or the multiset of future goods values
(frequency predictions) -- would enable the design of fairer online algorithms.
Given normalization information, we propose an algorithm that achieves stronger
fairness guarantees than previously known results. Given frequency predictions,
we introduce a meta-algorithm that leverages frequency predictions to match the
best-known offline guarantees for a broad class of ''share-based'' fairness
notions. Our complementary impossibility results in each setting underscore
both the limitations imposed by uncertainty about future goods and the
potential of leveraging structured information to achieve fairer outcomes in
online fair division.
