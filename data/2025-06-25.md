### [1] [MemeMind: A Large-Scale Multimodal Dataset with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Harmful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18919)
*Hexiang Gu,Qifan Yu,Saihui Hou,Zhiqin Fang,Huijia Wu,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出MemeMind数据集和MemeGuard框架，用于提升有害多模态模因的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有害模因检测因缺乏系统化、大规模、多样化且可解释的数据集而受限。

Method: 构建双语标注数据集MemeMind，并提出融合多模态信息与推理建模的MemeGuard框架。

Result: 实验表明MemeGuard在有害模因检测任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemeMind数据集和MemeGuard框架为有害模因检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of social media has intensified the spread of harmful
content. Harmful memes, which integrate both images and text, pose significant
challenges for automated detection due to their implicit semantics and complex
multimodal interactions. Although existing research has made progress in
detection accuracy and interpretability, the lack of a systematic, large-scale,
diverse, and highly explainable dataset continues to hinder further advancement
in this field. To address this gap, we introduce MemeMind, a novel dataset
featuring scientifically rigorous standards, large scale, diversity, bilingual
support (Chinese and English), and detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations.
MemeMind fills critical gaps in current datasets by offering comprehensive
labeling and explicit reasoning traces, thereby providing a solid foundation
for enhancing harmful meme detection. In addition, we propose an innovative
detection framework, MemeGuard, which effectively integrates multimodal
information with reasoning process modeling, significantly improving models'
ability to understand and identify harmful memes. Extensive experiments
conducted on the MemeMind dataset demonstrate that MemeGuard consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in harmful meme detection tasks.

### [2] [Mirage of Mastery: Memorization Tricks LLMs into Artificially Inflated Self-Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18998)
*Sahil Kale,Vijaykant Nadadur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs将记忆误认为推理能力，导致自我认知缺陷，尤其在STEM领域表现显著，需改进架构和训练方法以提高可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将LLMs的记忆和自我认知缺陷视为独立问题，未意识到两者交织会降低模型回答的可信度，尤其在STEM领域。

Method: 采用新框架评估LLMs是否真正学习推理模式，还是仅记忆相似复杂度的解决方案，重点关注科学和医学领域。

Result: LLMs因记忆解决方案而高估自身推理能力，面对逻辑一致的任务扰动时可行性评估不一致性超45%，科学和医学领域尤为明显。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的自我认知存在缺陷，需改进架构和训练方法，确保模型对自身知识的认知平衡一致，以提高AI的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: When artificial intelligence mistakes memorization for intelligence, it
creates a dangerous mirage of reasoning. Existing studies treat memorization
and self-knowledge deficits in LLMs as separate issues and do not recognize an
intertwining link that degrades the trustworthiness of LLM responses. In our
study, we utilize a novel framework to ascertain if LLMs genuinely learn
reasoning patterns from training data or merely memorize them to assume
competence across problems of similar complexity focused on STEM domains. Our
analysis shows a noteworthy problem in generalization: LLMs draw confidence
from memorized solutions to infer a higher self-knowledge about their reasoning
ability, which manifests as an over 45% inconsistency in feasibility
assessments when faced with self-validated, logically coherent task
perturbations. This effect is most pronounced in science and medicine domains,
which tend to have maximal standardized jargon and problems, further confirming
our approach. Significant wavering within the self-knowledge of LLMs also shows
flaws in current architectures and training patterns, highlighting the need for
techniques that ensure a balanced, consistent stance on models' perceptions of
their own knowledge for maximum AI explainability and trustworthiness. Our code
and results are available publicly at

### [3] [Broken Tokens? Your Language Model can Secretly Handle Non-Canonical Tokenizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19004)
*Brian Siyuan Zheng,Alisa Liu,Orevaoghene Ahia,Jonathan Hayase,Yejin Choi,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型对非标准分词方式具有较强鲁棒性，甚至在某些任务中能提升性能，表明模型对分词器的依赖低于预期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型对训练中未见过的非标准分词方式的鲁棒性，并探索非标准分词在特定任务中的潜在优势。

Method: 通过20个基准测试评估指令调优模型在不同非标准分词（如随机分词、字符级分词）下的性能表现，并分析模型行为差异。

Result: 模型在随机分词下保留93.4%性能，字符级分词提升代码任务14%，数字右对齐分词提升算术任务33%。鲁棒性源于指令调优阶段。

Conclusion: 模型对分词器的依赖性被低估，推理时干预分词策略可成为性能优化新方向。

Abstract: Modern tokenizers employ deterministic algorithms to map text into a single
"canonical" token sequence, yet the same string can be encoded as many
non-canonical tokenizations using the tokenizer vocabulary. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of LMs to text encoded with non-canonical
tokenizations entirely unseen during training. Surprisingly, when evaluated
across 20 benchmarks, we find that instruction-tuned models retain up to 93.4%
of their original performance when given a randomly sampled tokenization, and
90.8% with character-level tokenization. We see that overall stronger models
tend to be more robust, and robustness diminishes as the tokenization departs
farther from the canonical form. Motivated by these results, we then identify
settings where non-canonical tokenization schemes can *improve* performance,
finding that character-level segmentation improves string manipulation and code
understanding tasks by up to +14%, and right-aligned digit grouping enhances
large-number arithmetic by +33%. Finally, we investigate the source of this
robustness, finding that it arises in the instruction-tuning phase. We show
that while both base and post-trained models grasp the semantics of
non-canonical tokenizations (perceiving them as containing misspellings), base
models try to mimic the imagined mistakes and degenerate into nonsensical
output, while post-trained models are committed to fluent responses. Overall,
our findings suggest that models are less tied to their tokenizer than
previously believed, and demonstrate the promise of intervening on tokenization
at inference time to boost performance.

### [4] [Quantifying Fairness in LLMs Beyond Tokens: A Semantic and Statistical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19028)
*Weijie Xu,Yiwen Wang,Chi Xue,Xiangkun Hu,Xi Fang,Guimin Dong,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FiSCo框架，通过细粒度语义计算评估大语言模型的群体公平性，检测长文本中的隐性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视长文本偏见和模型输出的内在变异性，需更精细的公平性评估框架。

Method: FiSCo在声明级别分解输出，利用蕴涵检验和统计假设检验比较群体间语义差异。

Result: 实验表明FiSCo能更可靠识别细微偏见，减少随机变异影响，优于现有评估指标。

Conclusion: FiSCo为LLM公平性评估提供了更鲁棒的统计框架，适用于多维度人口统计场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases,
undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation
methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic
variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to
evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences
in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on
sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis
by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the
consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into
semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to
compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of
subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and
validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,
race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced
biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming
various evaluation metrics.

### [5] [Plan for Speed -- Dilated Scheduling for Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037)
*Omer Luxembourg,Haim Permuter,Eliya Nachmani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS)的新型推理方法，用于提升掩码扩散语言模型的并行解码效率，无需额外训练即可显著加速文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信度或熵的并行解掩码策略忽略了token间的相互依赖，导致推理速度受限。DUS旨在解决这一问题，实现高效的非自回归文本生成。

Method: DUS采用一阶马尔可夫假设，通过膨胀分组策略将序列位置划分为非相邻token组，实现局部上下文感知的并行解掩码，将去噪器调用次数降至O(log B)。

Result: 在数学推理(GSM8K)和代码补全(Humaneval, MBPP)任务中，DUS在保持生成质量的同时，显著优于现有并行置信度规划器，且无需修改底层去噪模型。

Conclusion: DUS为MDLM提供了一种轻量级、高效率的文本生成方案，有望释放掩码扩散模型的真正潜力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLM) have shown strong promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers act as implicit
planners, selecting tokens to unmask via denoiser confidence or entropy scores.
Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise
interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking
multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional
auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking
Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no
additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition
sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling
independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes
the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches
(e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces
the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding
substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion
models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In
experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks -
domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel
confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers
a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text
generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.

### [6] [NLPnorth @ TalentCLEF 2025: Comparing Discriminative, Contrastive, and Prompt-Based Methods for Job Title and Skill Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19058)
*Mike Zhang,Rob van der Goot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLPnorth团队在TalentCLEF 2025中提交了多语言职位匹配和基于职位的技能预测任务，比较了多种方法，发现多语言大模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 职位匹配和职位与技能对齐在计算就业市场领域非常重要，可以提升自动候选人匹配、职业路径预测和就业市场分析等任务的效果。

Method: 团队比较了基于微调的分类方法、基于微调的对比方法和提示方法，并利用ESCO的多语言职位描述数据增强模型。

Result: 任务A中，提示方法表现最佳，平均MAP为0.492；任务B中，基于分类的方法MAP为0.290。团队在任务A和B中分别排名第5和第3。

Conclusion: 多语言大模型在两项任务中表现最佳，展示了其在就业市场领域的强大潜力。

Abstract: Matching job titles is a highly relevant task in the computational job market
domain, as it improves e.g., automatic candidate matching, career path
prediction, and job market analysis. Furthermore, aligning job titles to job
skills can be considered an extension to this task, with similar relevance for
the same downstream tasks. In this report, we outline NLPnorth's submission to
TalentCLEF 2025, which includes both of these tasks: Multilingual Job Title
Matching, and Job Title-Based Skill Prediction. For both tasks we compare
(fine-tuned) classification-based, (fine-tuned) contrastive-based, and
prompting methods. We observe that for Task A, our prompting approach performs
best with an average of 0.492 mean average precision (MAP) on test data,
averaged over English, Spanish, and German. For Task B, we obtain an MAP of
0.290 on test data with our fine-tuned classification-based approach.
Additionally, we made use of extra data by pulling all the language-specific
titles and corresponding \emph{descriptions} from ESCO for each job and skill.
Overall, we find that the largest multilingual language models perform best for
both tasks. Per the provisional results and only counting the unique teams, the
ranking on Task A is 5$^{\text{th}}$/20 and for Task B 3$^{\text{rd}}$/14.

### [7] [MFTCXplain: A Multilingual Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating the Moral Reasoning of LLMs through Hate Speech Multi-hop Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19073)
*Jackson Trager,Francielle Vargas,Diego Alves,Matteo Guida,Mikel K. Ngueajio,Ameeta Agrawal,Flor Plaza-del-Arco,Yalda Daryanai,Farzan Karimi-Malekabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出多语言基准数据集MFTCXplain，评估大语言模型在道德推理上的表现，发现其在仇恨言论检测表现良好，但道德情感预测能力较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估基准缺乏道德分类的注释，且主要关注英语，限制了跨文化道德推理的评估。

Method: 引入MFTCXplain数据集，包含3000条多语言推文，标注仇恨言论标签、道德类别和文本跨度级理由。

Result: 大语言模型在仇恨言论检测上表现良好（F1达0.836），但道德情感预测能力弱（F1<0.35），且在少数语言中理由对齐有限。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在理解和反映人类道德推理方面能力有限。

Abstract: Ensuring the moral reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a growing concern as these systems are used in socially sensitive tasks.
Nevertheless, current evaluation benchmarks present two major shortcomings: a
lack of annotations that justify moral classifications, which limits
transparency and interpretability; and a predominant focus on English, which
constrains the assessment of moral reasoning across diverse cultural settings.
In this paper, we introduce MFTCXplain, a multilingual benchmark dataset for
evaluating the moral reasoning of LLMs via hate speech multi-hop explanation
using Moral Foundation Theory (MFT). The dataset comprises 3,000 tweets across
Portuguese, Italian, Persian, and English, annotated with binary hate speech
labels, moral categories, and text span-level rationales. Empirical results
highlight a misalignment between LLM outputs and human annotations in moral
reasoning tasks. While LLMs perform well in hate speech detection (F1 up to
0.836), their ability to predict moral sentiments is notably weak (F1 < 0.35).
Furthermore, rationale alignment remains limited mainly in underrepresented
languages. These findings show the limited capacity of current LLMs to
internalize and reflect human moral reasoning.

### [8] [Language Models Might Not Understand You: Evaluating Theory of Mind via Story Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19089)
*Nathaniel Getachew,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了StorySim框架，用于生成合成故事以评估大语言模型的心理理论和世界建模能力，发现模型在WM任务上表现优于ToM任务，并存在启发式行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有基准测试可能因预训练数据污染而影响评估准确性的问题，开发了一个可编程框架来生成新颖、可组合的故事提示，以更精确地评估大语言模型的能力。

Method: 使用StorySim框架设计了一阶和二阶心理理论任务及世界建模任务，通过高度可控的Storyboard精确操纵角色视角和事件。

Result: 实验表明，大多数模型在世界建模任务上表现优于心理理论任务，且在推理人类行为时表现优于无生命物体。同时发现了模型存在近期偏差和过度依赖故事早期事件的启发式行为。

Conclusion: StorySim框架有效评估了大语言模型的心理理论和世界建模能力，揭示了模型在任务表现和行为模式上的差异，为未来研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{StorySim}$, a programmable framework for synthetically
generating stories to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) and world modeling (WM)
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior benchmarks that may
suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces
novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable
$\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives
and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks
alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental
states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that
most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to
perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects.
Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior
such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story. All
code for generating data and evaluations is freely available.

### [9] [Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19113)
*Ramaravind K. Mothilal,Joanna Roy,Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed,Shion Guha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新方法HAF，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在毒性解释中的推理能力，发现LLM在复杂提示下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注毒性检测，而忽略了LLM在毒性解释中的推理能力。本文旨在通过评估LLM的解释能力，提升其在下游任务中的可信度。

Method: 提出了一种理论支持的多维标准HAF，开发了六个基于不确定性量化的指标，无需人工参与即可全面评估LLM的毒性解释。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在简单提示下能生成合理的解释，但在复杂提示下表现不一致且荒谬。

Conclusion: LLM在毒性解释中的推理能力仍有局限，尤其是在处理复杂关系时表现不佳。

Abstract: The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around
detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs' reasoning about
toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their
trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on
explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate
free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text
perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a
novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned
Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs' free-form toxicity
explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We
develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively
evaluate \haf of LLMs' toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and
highlight how "non-ideal" the explanations are. We conduct several experiments
on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five
diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible
explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when
prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the
individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and
nonsensical responses. We open-source our code and LLM-generated explanations
at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF.

### [10] [Enhanced Hybrid Transducer and Attention Encoder Decoder with Text Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19159)
*Yun Tang,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合语音和文本优化的混合TAED模型（J-TAED），通过结合语音和文本输入提升ASR准确率，并支持纯文本的领域自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量文本语料库提升自动语音识别（ASR）的准确性，并解决领域不匹配任务中语音数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 联合训练语音和文本输入的混合TAED模型（J-TAED），推理时仅需语音输入，支持文本进行领域自适应。

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上WER降低5.8%~12.8%，在两个领域外数据集上通过文本自适应分别降低WER 15.3%和17.8%。

Conclusion: J-TAED成功整合语音和语言信息，显著提升ASR性能，尤其在数据稀缺的领域任务中表现优异。

Abstract: A joint speech and text optimization method is proposed for hybrid transducer
and attention-based encoder decoder (TAED) modeling to leverage large amounts
of text corpus and enhance ASR accuracy. The joint TAED (J-TAED) is trained
with both speech and text input modalities together, while it only takes speech
data as input during inference. The trained model can unify the internal
representations from different modalities, and be further extended to
text-based domain adaptation. It can effectively alleviate data scarcity for
mismatch domain tasks since no speech data is required. Our experiments show
J-TAED successfully integrates speech and linguistic information into one
model, and reduce the WER by 5.8 ~12.8% on the Librispeech dataset. The model
is also evaluated on two out-of-domain datasets: one is finance and another is
named entity focused. The text-based domain adaptation brings 15.3% and 17.8%
WER reduction on those two datasets respectively.

*Christopher Toukmaji,Jeffrey Flanigan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在低资源语言的上下文学习中，少样本提示和翻译测试方法优于基于梯度的适应方法，主要由于后者存在灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）主要针对高资源语言训练，低资源语言在上下文学习中表现不佳。本文旨在探索如何跨语言适应LLMs以提升低资源语言的任务性能。

Method: 研究覆盖五种目标语言、三种基础LLMs和七项下游任务，比较了少样本提示、翻译测试、微调、嵌入重初始化和指令微调等多种适应技术。

Result: 少样本提示和翻译测试方法显著优于基于梯度的适应方法。通过新设计的有效输出召回率（VOR）指标，发现性能下降主要源于灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言的上下文学习中，非梯度方法（如少样本提示）更具优势。研究提供了全面的实验数据和模型供公开使用。

Abstract: LLMs are typically trained in high-resource languages, and tasks in
lower-resourced languages tend to underperform the higher-resource language
counterparts for in-context learning. Despite the large body of work on
prompting settings, it is still unclear how LLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for in-context learning in the low-resource target
languages. We perform a comprehensive study spanning five diverse target
languages, three base LLMs, and seven downstream tasks spanning over 4,100 GPU
training hours (9,900+ TFLOPs) across various adaptation techniques: few-shot
prompting, translate-test, fine-tuning, embedding re-initialization, and
instruction fine-tuning. Our results show that the few-shot prompting and
translate-test settings tend to heavily outperform the gradient-based
adaptation methods. To better understand this discrepancy, we design a novel
metric, Valid Output Recall (VOR), and analyze model outputs to empirically
attribute the degradation of these trained models to catastrophic forgetting.
To the extent of our knowledge, this is the largest study done on in-context
learning for low-resource languages with respect to train compute and number of
adaptation techniques considered. We make all our datasets and trained models
available for public use.

*Yichen Tang,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Min Zhang,Shaoping Ma,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多智能体通信协议，通过传递自然语言标记及状态转移轨迹（SDE）来减少信息损失，提升复杂推理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统主要依赖自然语言通信，导致信息损失严重，尤其在传递推理逻辑或抽象思维时。

Method: 提出状态差分编码（SDE）方法，传递标记生成过程中的状态转移轨迹，而非仅传递最终状态。

Result: 实验表明，采用SDE的多智能体系统在复杂推理任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通信增强对基于LLM的多智能体系统具有显著潜力，SDE能有效捕捉推理过程中的隐含信息。

Abstract: Multi-agent techniques such as role playing or multi-turn debates have been
shown to be effective in improving the performance of large language models
(LLMs) in downstream tasks. Despite their differences in workflows, existing
LLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent
communication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,
it also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample
its continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the
other model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to
transfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To
tackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers
both natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from
one agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find
that the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can
better reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we
propose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition
trajectories. The experimental results show that multi-agent systems with SDE
achieve SOTA performance compared to other communication protocols,
particularly in tasks that involve complex reasoning. This shows the potential
of communication augmentation for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

*Rasiq Hussain,Jerry Ma,Rithik Khandelwal,Joshua Oltmanns,Mehak Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合预训练语言模型和RNN注意力机制的两步法，用于从长文本中预测五因素模型人格特质，提升了准确性、效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人格评估方法依赖问卷，而自然语言处理（NLP）为通过开放文本评估人格提供了新途径。本研究旨在解决长文本（超过2000词）建模的挑战，以预测五因素模型（FFM）人格特质。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 使用滑动窗口微调预训练语言模型提取上下文嵌入；2) 应用带注意力机制的循环神经网络（RNN）整合长距离依赖关系并增强可解释性。

Result: 通过消融实验和与LLaMA、Longformer等先进长文本模型的对比，该方法在预测准确性、效率和可解释性上均有所提升。

Conclusion: 结合语言特征与长文本建模的方法，能够有效推动基于生活叙事的人格评估研究。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers new avenues for personality
assessment by leveraging rich, open-ended text, moving beyond traditional
questionnaires. In this study, we address the challenge of modeling long
narrative interview where each exceeds 2000 tokens so as to predict Five-Factor
Model (FFM) personality traits. We propose a two-step approach: first, we
extract contextual embeddings using sliding-window fine-tuning of pretrained
language models; then, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention
mechanisms to integrate long-range dependencies and enhance interpretability.
This hybrid method effectively bridges the strengths of pretrained transformers
and sequence modeling to handle long-context data. Through ablation studies and
comparisons with state-of-the-art long-context models such as LLaMA and
Longformer, we demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy, efficiency, and
interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of combining
language-based features with long-context modeling to advance personality
assessment from life narratives.

Abstract: With the remarkable generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
using LLM-generated data to train downstream models has emerged as a promising
approach to mitigate data scarcity in specific domains and reduce
time-consuming annotations. However, recent studies have highlighted a critical
issue: iterative training on self-generated data results in model collapse,
where model performance degrades over time. Despite extensive research on the
implications of LLM-generated data, these works often neglect the importance of
data diversity, a key factor in data quality. In this work, we aim to
understand the implications of the diversity of LLM-generated data on
downstream model performance. Specifically, we explore how varying levels of
diversity in LLM-generated data affect downstream model performance.
Additionally, we investigate the performance of models trained on data that
mixes different proportions of LLM-generated data, which we refer to as
synthetic data. Our experimental results show that, with minimal distribution
shift, moderately diverse LLM-generated data can enhance model performance in
scenarios with insufficient labeled data, whereas highly diverse generated data
has a negative impact. We hope our empirical findings will offer valuable
guidance for future studies on LLMs as data generators.

Result: 实验显示EmoStage在日文和中文咨询场景中优于基线模型，媲美数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升AI心理咨询的共情能力与流程适配性，具有实用潜力。

Abstract: The rising demand for mental health care has fueled interest in AI-driven
counseling systems. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential, current approaches face challenges, including limited understanding
of clients' psychological states and counseling stages, reliance on
high-quality training data, and privacy concerns associated with commercial
deployment. To address these issues, we propose EmoStage, a framework that
enhances empathetic response generation by leveraging the inference
capabilities of open-source LLMs without additional training data. Our
framework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states
and support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.
In addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the
counseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune
responses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling
settings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated
by base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods.

Method: 采用Mamba（选择性状态空间模型）作为基础框架，整合语音学特征和think token策略，增强模型的可解释性和细粒度时序推理能力。

Result: 在speechocean762基准测试中，该模型表现优于现有方法，尤其在错误检测任务上效果显著。

Conclusion: 这是首个在CAPT中结合语音学归因、SSM建模和提示策略的研究，为发音训练系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective pronunciation feedback is critical in second language (L2)
learning, for which computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems
often encompass two key tasks: automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD). Recent work has shown that
joint modeling of these two tasks can yield mutual benefits. Our unified
framework leverages Mamba, a selective state space model (SSM), while
integrating phonological features and think token strategies to jointly enhance
interpretability and fine-grained temporal reasoning in APA and MDD. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to combine phonological attribution,
SSM-based modeling, and prompting in CAPT. A series of experiments conducted on
the speechocean762 benchmark demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms prior methods, particularly on the MDD task.

Abstract: Ensuring persona fidelity in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
maintaining coherent and engaging human-AI interactions. However, LLMs often
exhibit Out-of-Character (OOC) behavior, where generated responses deviate from
an assigned persona, leading to inconsistencies that affect model reliability.
Existing evaluation methods typically assign single scores to entire responses,
struggling to capture subtle persona misalignment, particularly in long-form
text generation. To address this limitation, we propose an atomic-level
evaluation framework that quantifies persona fidelity at a finer granularity.
Our three key metrics measure the degree of persona alignment and consistency
within and across generations. Our approach enables a more precise and
realistic assessment of persona fidelity by identifying subtle deviations that
real users would encounter. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our
framework effectively detects persona inconsistencies that prior methods
overlook. By analyzing persona fidelity across diverse tasks and personality
types, we reveal how task structure and persona desirability influence model
adaptability, highlighting challenges in maintaining consistent persona
expression.

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and
controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of
large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental
challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations.
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for
feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature
isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these
limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric
to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these
insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that
conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We
demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts
within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and
control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style
identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only
enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained
steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable
guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control
of LLMs.

Conclusion: VeilProbe为黑盒环境下的预训练文本检测提供了高效自动化工具，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Detecting whether a given text is a member of the pre-training data of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and copyright
protection. Most existing methods rely on the LLM's hidden information (e.g.,
model parameters or token probabilities), making them ineffective in the
black-box setting, where only input and output texts are accessible. Although
some methods have been proposed for the black-box setting, they rely on massive
manual efforts such as designing complicated questions or instructions. To
address these issues, we propose VeilProbe, the first framework for
automatically detecting LLMs' pre-training texts in a black-box setting without
human intervention. VeilProbe utilizes a sequence-to-sequence mapping model to
infer the latent mapping feature between the input text and the corresponding
output suffix generated by the LLM. Then it performs the key token
perturbations to obtain more distinguishable membership features. Additionally,
considering real-world scenarios where the ground-truth training text samples
are limited, a prototype-based membership classifier is introduced to alleviate
the overfitting issue. Extensive evaluations on three widely used datasets
demonstrate that our framework is effective and superior in the black-box
setting.

Abstract: Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language
models (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,
interpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language
models have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,
they often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work
investigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised
within the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a
complete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based
language VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a
supporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The
experiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under
explicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -
can be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation
results in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior
knowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the
model to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on
Key. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into
decoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning
tasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance
beyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at
preserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.

Abstract: Human annotation variation (i.e., annotation disagreements) is common in NLP
and often reflects important information such as task subjectivity and sample
ambiguity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for
automatic annotation to reduce human effort, their evaluation often focuses on
predicting the majority-voted "ground truth" labels. It is still unclear,
however, whether these models also capture informative human annotation
variation. Our work addresses this gap by extensively evaluating LLMs' ability
to predict annotation disagreements without access to repeated human labels.
Our results show that LLMs struggle with modeling disagreements, which can be
overlooked by majority label-based evaluations. Notably, while RLVR-style
(Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) reasoning generally boosts LLM
performance, it degrades performance in disagreement prediction. Our findings
highlight the critical need for evaluating and improving LLM annotators in
disagreement modeling. Code and data at

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, with new

However, existing evaluation datasets are limited and lack cross-lingual

several state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs and find notable gaps between
claimed and actual language coverage, particularly a persistent performance
disparity between English and low-resource languages. Leveraging MuBench's
alignment, we propose Multilingual Consistency (MLC) as a complementary metric
to accuracy for analyzing performance bottlenecks and guiding model
improvement. Finally, we pretrain a suite of 1.2B-parameter models on English
and Chinese with 500B tokens, varying language ratios and parallel data
proportions to investigate cross-lingual transfer dynamics.

Abstract: This paper provides preliminary results on exploring the task of performing
turn-level data augmentation for dialogue system based on different types of
commonsense relationships, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
synthetic turns. The proposed methodology takes advantage of the extended
knowledge and zero-shot capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to follow instructions, understand contextual information, and their
commonsense reasoning capabilities. The approach draws inspiration from
methodologies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied more explicitly to the task
of prompt-based generation for dialogue-based data augmentation conditioned on
commonsense attributes, and the automatic evaluation of the generated
dialogues.
  To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, first we extracted 200
randomly selected partial dialogues, from 5 different well-known dialogue
datasets, and generate alternative responses conditioned on different event
commonsense attributes. This novel dataset allows us to measure the proficiency
of LLMs in generating contextually relevant commonsense knowledge, particularly
up to 12 different specific ATOMIC [10] database relations. Secondly, we
propose an evaluation framework to automatically detect the quality of the
generated dataset inspired by the ACCENT [26] metric, which offers a nuanced
approach to assess event commonsense. However, our method does not follow
ACCENT's complex eventrelation tuple extraction process. Instead, we propose an
instruction-based prompt for each commonsense attribute and use
state-of-the-art LLMs to automatically detect the original attributes used when
creating each augmented turn in the previous step.
  Preliminary results suggest that our approach effectively harnesses LLMs
capabilities for commonsense reasoning and evaluation in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming education by enabling
rich conversational learning experiences. This article provides a comprehensive
review of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher
education, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We
synthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of
conversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural
learning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic
method, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting
strategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors
with these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive
learning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where
LLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it
challenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps
in applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency
to provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,
and the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human
expertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better
align LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts
that encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student
reflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and
contextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory
and the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering
insights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive
and theory-aligned.

Result: 大型模型一致性优于小型模型，但普遍存在自我矛盾等行为；高效推理策略显著增加不一致性。

Conclusion: 高效推理虽提升效率，但可能引入模型逃避有效监督的风险，需进一步研究其潜在影响。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet
this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token
generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient
reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it
remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the
intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model
responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether
efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To
systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to
measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across
task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned
behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and
self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,
we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than
smaller ones, they all display widespread "scheming" behaviors, including
self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning
cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies
such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three
defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient
reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative
to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading
effective supervision.

Motivation: 减少大型语言模型中KV缓存的内存占用，同时最小化超低位量化带来的性能下降。

Method: 提出锚定分数（AnS）量化令牌敏感性，设计AnTKV框架结合向量量化和高效内核实现快速在线选择。

Result: AnTKV在4位量化下优于现有方法，1位和0.375位量化时困惑度显著低于FP16基线，支持840K上下文。

Conclusion: AnTKV有效平衡了KV缓存压缩与模型性能，为超低位量化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization has emerged as an effective and lightweight solution to reduce
the memory footprint of the KV cache in Large Language Models (LLMs).
Nevertheless, minimizing the performance degradation caused by ultra-low-bit KV
cache quantization remains a significant challenge. We observe that quantizing
the KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of
attention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform
forward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score
(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to
quantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS
across tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision
(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive
quantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel
framework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the
KV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a
triton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast
online Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context
lengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x
higher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline. Our experiment
results demonstrate that AnTKV matches or outperforms prior works such as KIVI,
SKVQ, KVQuant, and CQ under 4-bit settings. More importantly, AnTKV achieves
significantly lower perplexity under ultra-low-bit quantization on Mistral-7B,
with only 6.32 at 1-bit and 8.87 at 0.375-bit, compared to the FP16 baseline of
4.73.

Result: 混合方法实现了91%的结构化准确性，同时减少了延迟和计算成本。LLMs在语义细微差别处理上表现更好，而NERL在结构精确性上更优。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了NERL和LLMs的互补优势，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景，显著提高了结构化准确性并限制了计算成本。

Abstract: Automatically structuring posology instructions is essential for improving
medication safety and enabling clinical decision support. In French
prescriptions, these instructions are often ambiguous, irregular, or
colloquial, limiting the effectiveness of classic ML pipelines. We explore the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert free-text posologies into
structured formats, comparing prompt-based methods and fine-tuning against a
"pre-LLM" system based on Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NERL). Our
results show that while prompting improves performance, only fine-tuned LLMs
match the accuracy of the baseline. Through error analysis, we observe
complementary strengths: NERL offers structural precision, while LLMs better
handle semantic nuances. Based on this, we propose a hybrid pipeline that
routes low-confidence cases from NERL (<0.8) to the LLM, selecting outputs
based on confidence scores. This strategy achieves 91% structuration accuracy
while minimizing latency and compute. Our results show that this hybrid
approach improves structuration accuracy while limiting computational cost,
offering a scalable solution for real-world clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在适应新任务时依赖静态预训练知识，传统微调方法成本高且易导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出KnowMap方法，通过微调小型知识嵌入模型，为LLM动态整合环境和经验知识。

Result: 在ScienceWorld基准测试中，GPT-4 Turbo模型性能提升17.71%。

Conclusion: KnowMap高效增强了LLM的任务适应能力，展示了环境与经验知识整合的潜力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) possess significant capabilities in
open-world agent tasks, they also face challenges in rapidly adapting to new,
specialized tasks due to their reliance on static pre-trained knowledge.
Traditional methods such as fine-tuning are often costly, data-intensive, and
may lead to "catastrophic forgetting." Therefore, we present KnowMap, a novel
approach that dynamically constructs a knowledge base from environmental and
experiential data. KnowMap fine-tunes a small knowledge-embedding model to
equip a larger LLM with valuable task-specific knowledge. Our experiments on
the ScienceWorld benchmark demonstrate 17.71% improvement for the performance
of gpt-4-turbo model. KnowMap not only provides an efficient and effective
means for LLM task-adapting, but also highlights how integrating environmental
and experiential knowledge can enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疾病监测方法存在挑战，而在线媒体信息量大，手动筛选不切实际，因此需要自动化工具来高效监测健康事件。

Method: 使用多阶段信息提取管道，结合机器学习和非机器学习方法，从在线文章中提取结构化健康事件信息。

Result: 自2022年4月以来，处理了超过3亿篇新闻文章，识别了95,000多个独特健康事件，其中3,500多个被专家列为潜在暴发事件。

Conclusion: Health Sentinel能有效监测在线健康事件，为公共卫生机构提供及时干预支持。

Abstract: Early detection of disease outbreaks is crucial to ensure timely intervention
by the health authorities. Due to the challenges associated with traditional
indicator-based surveillance, monitoring informal sources such as online media
has become increasingly popular. However, owing to the number of online
articles getting published everyday, manual screening of the articles is
impractical. To address this, we propose Health Sentinel. It is a multi-stage
information extraction pipeline that uses a combination of ML and non-ML
methods to extract events-structured information concerning disease outbreaks
or other unusual health events-from online articles. The extracted events are
made available to the Media Scanning and Verification Cell (MSVC) at the
National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi for analysis, interpretation
and further dissemination to local agencies for timely intervention. From April
2022 till date, Health Sentinel has processed over 300 million news articles
and identified over 95,000 unique health events across India of which over
3,500 events were shortlisted by the public health experts at NCDC as potential
outbreaks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖Softmax归一化的注意力权重，忽略了pre-Softmax的query-key logits中的丰富信息。

Method: 引入RCStat框架，通过Relative Contextualization（RC）随机变量分析token段间上下文对齐，并推导RC的高效上界。

Result: 在问答、摘要和归因任务中，RCStat实现了最先进的KV压缩和归因性能，且无需模型重训练。

Conclusion: RCStat通过利用原始注意力logits，显著提升了模型压缩和解释能力。

Abstract: Prior work on input-token importance in auto-regressive transformers has
relied on Softmax-normalized attention weights, which obscure the richer
structure of pre-Softmax query-key logits. We introduce RCStat, a statistical
framework that harnesses raw attention logits via Relative Contextualization
(RC), a random variable measuring contextual alignment between token segments,
and derive an efficient upper bound for RC. We demonstrate two applications:
(i) Key-Value compression, where RC-based thresholds drive adaptive key-value
eviction for substantial cache reduction with minimal quality loss; and (ii)
Attribution, where RC yields higher-fidelity token-, sentence-, and chunk-level
explanations than post-Softmax methods. Across question answering,
summarization, and attribution benchmarks, RCStat achieves significant
empirical gains, delivering state-of-the-art compression and attribution
performance without any model retraining.

Motivation: 为了更清晰地理解机器翻译评估指标的性能并确立其上限，研究将人类基线纳入评估体系，以检验自动指标的实际表现。

Method: 研究通过将人类基线引入机器翻译的元评估（即对评估指标能力的评估），比较自动指标与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果表明，人类标注者并不总是优于自动指标，最先进的指标常与人类基线持平或更高。

Conclusion: 尽管结果暗示了人类与自动指标的持平，但研究提醒需谨慎解读，并探讨了这对机器翻译评估领域进步测量的影响。

Abstract: In Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, metric performance is assessed based
on agreement with human judgments. In recent years, automatic metrics have
demonstrated increasingly high levels of agreement with humans. To gain a
clearer understanding of metric performance and establish an upper bound, we
incorporate human baselines in the MT meta-evaluation, that is, the assessment
of MT metrics' capabilities. Our results show that human annotators are not
consistently superior to automatic metrics, with state-of-the-art metrics often
ranking on par with or higher than human baselines. Despite these findings
suggesting human parity, we discuss several reasons for caution. Finally, we
explore the broader implications of our results for the research field, asking:
Can we still reliably measure improvements in MT evaluation? With this work, we
aim to shed light on the limits of our ability to measure progress in the
field, fostering discussion on an issue that we believe is crucial to the
entire MT evaluation community.

Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言处理中表现突出，但存在输出不可靠和缺乏透明度的问题，需要改进推理链的验证方法。

Method: 提出ECCoT框架，结合MRF-ETM进行主题感知推理链生成，使用CSBert对齐因果推理，并通过结构化排序统计过滤无效链。

Result: ECCoT提高了推理链的可解释性，减少了偏见，增强了基于大语言模型决策的可信度。

Conclusion: ECCoT框架有效提升了大语言模型推理的可靠性和透明度，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale artificial intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing. However,
they often lack transparency and generate unreliable outputs, raising concerns
about their interpretability. To address this, the Chain of Thought (CoT)
prompting method structures reasoning into step-by-step deductions. Yet, not
all reasoning chains are valid, and errors can lead to unreliable conclusions.
We propose ECCoT, an End-to-End Cognitive Chain of Thought Validation
Framework, to evaluate and refine reasoning chains in LLMs. ECCoT integrates
the Markov Random Field-Embedded Topic Model (MRF-ETM) for topic-aware CoT
generation and Causal Sentence-BERT (CSBert) for causal reasoning alignment. By
filtering ineffective chains using structured ordering statistics, ECCoT
improves interpretability, reduces biases, and enhances the trustworthiness of
LLM-based decision-making. Key contributions include the introduction of ECCoT,
MRF-ETM for topic-driven CoT generation, and CSBert for causal reasoning
enhancement. Code is released at: https://github.com/erwinmsmith/ECCoT.git.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注仇恨言论的文本检测，而用户层面的分析同样重要但更具挑战性。

Method: 采用多模态聚合方法，综合用户发布的潜在仇恨文本、用户活动及其社交网络进行分析。

Result: 在Twitter、Gab和Parler三个数据集上验证，该方法显著提升了仇恨传播者的检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别加密信息、种族煽动等内容，并适用于不同平台和大规模网络。

Abstract: Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the
detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can
promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social
phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances,
we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging.
In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection
of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user
activity, and the user network. Evaluating our method on three unique datasets
X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler we show that processing a user's texts in her
social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared
to previously used text and graph-based methods. We offer comprehensive set of
results obtained in different experimental settings as well as qualitative
analysis of illustrative cases. Our method can be used to improve the
classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as
well as to inform intervention measures. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
multimodal approach performs well across very different content platforms and
over large datasets and networks.

Method: 应用两种先进的自我纠正系统，利用搜索引擎提供的证据对摘要进行迭代修正，并分析其性能。

Result: 研究发现搜索引擎片段和少量示例提示对纠正幻觉有效，且G-Eval与人工评估高度一致。

Conclusion: 自我纠正方法在新闻摘要领域具有潜力，搜索引擎证据和少量示例提示能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to
generate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --
factually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle
hallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They
leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification
questions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external
knowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new
corrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but
less so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two
state-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct
hallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the
results and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting
practical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot
prompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates large language

a state-of-the-art LLM baseline in terms of reward, showing a potential benefit

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨强化后训练（RPT）在不同领域中的泛化能力，尤其是对未见过的领域是否有效。

Method: 通过观察性研究（比较不同RPT模型与基础模型）和干预性研究（单领域微调后多领域评估）两种方法进行分析。

Result: RPT在类似训练数据的任务上表现显著提升，但在不同推理模式的领域中效果不稳定甚至消失。

Conclusion: RPT的改进效果对领域依赖性较强，泛化能力有限，需进一步研究提升跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement post training (RPT) has recently shown promise in improving the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, it remains
unclear how well these improvements generalize to new domains, as prior work
evaluates RPT models on data from the same domains used for fine-tuning. To
understand the generalizability of RPT, we conduct two studies. (1)
Observational: We compare a wide range of open-weight RPT models against their
corresponding base models across multiple domains, including both seen and
unseen domains in their fine-tuning data. (2) Interventional: we fine-tune LLMs
with RPT on single domains and evaluate their performance across multiple
domains. Both studies converge on the same conclusion that, although RPT brings
substantial gains on tasks similar to the fine-tuning data, the gains
generalize inconsistently and can vanish on domains with different reasoning
patterns.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于合成病例模拟方法，用于评估症状检查器算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 症状检查器（SCs）需要评估算法更新对罕见疾病诊断性能的影响，但获取足够评估数据困难且成本高。

Method: 利用人类表型本体（HPO）的疾病-表型注释生成合成病例，模拟SCs访谈以评估算法更新的影响，并通过R²系数验证方法有效性。

Result: 实验显示，对于HPO中包含频率信息的疾病，方法能有效预测性能变化（R²=0.831），而无频率信息时预测误差较大。

Conclusion: 该方法利用公开知识库实现了低成本、透明的罕见疾病诊断性能评估，有助于提升早期诊断支持。

Abstract: Background: Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide users with personalized medical
information. To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC
developers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases
before deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare
diseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is
costly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel
Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance
changes for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:
We used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),
a knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With
these, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates
on real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated
retrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using
the R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC
algorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO
(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8
change, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict
post-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for
diseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The
manual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours
per disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC
algorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,
expert-created knowledge base. This transparent and low-cost approach allows
developers to efficiently improve diagnostic performance for rare diseases,
potentially enhancing support for early diagnosis.

Motivation: 传统基于多头注意力（MHA）的ASR模型因序列长度的二次复杂度问题，不适用于长语音识别。研究旨在找到一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用线性复杂度的双向循环注意力（RA）层，提出有限上下文注意力（LCA）基线，并开发了长训练范式及Direction Dropout正则化方法。

Result: 双向RA层在短、长语音识别中均达到MHA的准确度，且效率更高。Direction Dropout进一步提升了精度，并提供了新的交替方向模式。

Conclusion: RA层在长语音识别中优于MHA和LCA，结合Direction Dropout可平衡精度与效率，为ASR领域提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Long-form speech recognition is an application area of increasing research
focus. ASR models based on multi-head attention (MHA) are ill-suited to
long-form ASR because of their quadratic complexity in sequence length. We
build on recent work that has investigated linear complexity recurrent
attention (RA) layers for ASR. We find that bidirectional RA layers can match
the accuracy of MHA for both short- and long-form applications. We present a
strong limited-context attention (LCA) baseline, and show that RA layers are
just as accurate while being more efficient. We develop a long-form training
paradigm which further improves RA performance, leading to better accuracy than
LCA with 44% higher throughput. We also present Direction Dropout, a novel
regularization method that improves accuracy, provides fine-grained control of
the accuracy/throughput trade-off of bidirectional RA, and enables a new
alternating directions decoding mode with even higher throughput.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在推理任务中取得了显著进展，但如何最优整合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）仍是一个基本挑战。

Method: 通过熵基视角分析标记分布和学习动态，提出SRFT方法，单阶段同时应用SFT和RL，直接优化LLM。

Result: SRFT在五个数学推理基准测试中平均准确率达到59.1%，优于零RL方法9.0%，在三个分布外基准测试中优于10.9%。

Conclusion: SRFT通过统一SFT和RL，显著提升了LLM的性能，尤其在数学推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning
tasks, yet the optimal integration of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains a fundamental challenge. Through
comprehensive analysis of token distributions, learning dynamics, and
integration mechanisms from entropy-based perspectives, we reveal key
differences between these paradigms: SFT induces coarse-grained global changes
to LLM policy distributions, while RL performs fine-grained selective
optimizations, with entropy serving as a critical indicator of training
effectiveness. Building on these observations, we propose Supervised
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT), a single-stage method that unifies both
fine-tuning paradigms through entropy-aware weighting mechanisms. Our approach
simultaneously applies SFT and RL to directly optimize the LLM using
demonstrations and self-exploration rollouts rather than through two-stage
sequential methods. Extensive experiments show that SRFT achieves 59.1% average
accuracy, outperforming zero-RL methods by 9.0% on five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and 10.9% on three out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型的预训练依赖海量网络爬取数据，但高质量文本稀缺且自然数据增长无法匹配算力需求，导致数据瓶颈。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过引导式改写被过滤的低质量文档，将其转化为可用训练数据，增加合成数据在预训练集中的占比。

Result: 在1B/3B/7B规模实验中，混合原始文本与改写文本使22项任务平均提升1.0/1.3/2.5个百分点，效果优于单纯使用2倍网络数据或其他合成数据方法。

Conclusion: 回收利用网络文本是扩展预训练数据的简单有效方法，82%改写文本来自原被丢弃的低质量文档，REWIRE显著优于现有合成数据方案。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our
analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as
the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task
complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality
demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance.
We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology,
demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical
reasoning capabilities.

### [44] [How Effectively Can BERT Models Interpret Context and Detect Bengali Communal Violent Text?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19831)
*Abdullah Khondoker,Enam Ahmed Taufik,Md. Iftekhar Islam Tashik,S M Ishtiak Mahmud,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调BanglaBERT模型并构建集成模型，提升了孟加拉语社交媒体文本中煽动社区暴力内容的检测准确率，同时揭示了模型在上下文理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络仇恨言论的传播加剧了宗教、种族和社会群体间的暴力冲突，对社会和谐构成严重威胁。然而，现有研究对社区暴力文本的分类探索不足，尤其是针对孟加拉语文本的检测。

Method: 研究使用微调的BanglaBERT模型检测社区暴力文本，并通过数据增强（新增1,794条样本）构建集成模型。结合LIME工具分析模型决策的可解释性。

Result: 微调模型宏F1得分为0.60，集成模型提升至0.63。定性分析发现模型对近义词区分和上下文理解存在困难，导致高置信度误分类。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了NLP技术在减少网络社区暴力中的潜力，同时指出需改进模型上下文理解能力，为未来提升检测精度和社会影响奠定基础。

Abstract: The spread of cyber hatred has led to communal violence, fueling aggression
and conflicts between various religious, ethnic, and social groups, posing a
significant threat to social harmony. Despite its critical importance, the
classification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in
existing research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text
that incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data
sourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model
tailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the
issue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,
which facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble
model. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a
macro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In
addition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed
instances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to
occasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high
confidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we
identified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,
particularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal
and non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied
LIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in
understanding context, contributing to errors in classification. These findings
highlight the promise of NLP and interpretability tools in reducing online
communal violence. Our work contributes to the growing body of research in
communal violence detection and offers a foundation for future studies aiming
to refine these techniques for better accuracy and societal impact.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出模块化多智能体框架MAM，通过角色分工提升多模态医疗诊断性能，显著超越基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态医疗大模型在知识更新成本、全面性和灵活性方面存在局限，需改进。

Method: MAM将诊断过程分解为不同角色（如全科医生、专科团队等），每个角色由基于LLM的智能体承担。

Result: 在多模态医疗数据集上，MAM性能比基线模型提升18%-365%。

Conclusion: MAM框架通过模块化协作有效提升医疗诊断能力，支持高效知识更新。

Abstract: Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased
their powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,
current unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update
costs, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis
(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role
assignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical
diagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist
Team, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an
LLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient
knowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.
Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly
accessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and
video modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance
of modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance
improvements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models. Our code is
released at https://github.com/yczhou001/MAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨自主代理如何通过学习和信号发展共享行为系统（类似文化），以及不同通信策略如何影响其适应性和合作。

Method: 使用NEC-DAC系统，每个代理配备神经网络进行决策，分析不同社会结构（如权威层级）对文化自组织的影响。

Result: 合作文化显著影响部落表现，信号不仅促进文化涌现，还能跨代传播。个体代理神经网络中的行为协调和信号传递具有优势。

Conclusion: 自主代理通过通信信号自组织文化，提升合作效率，信号传递对文化延续至关重要。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how autonomous agents, organized into tribes,
learn to use communication signals to coordinate their activities and enhance
their collective efficiency. Using the NEC-DAC (Neurally Encoded Culture -
Distributed Autonomous Communicators) system, where each agent is equipped with
its own neural network for decision-making, we demonstrate how these agents
develop a shared behavioral system -- akin to a culture -- through learning and
signalling. Our research focuses on the self-organization of culture within
these tribes of agents and how varying communication strategies impact their
fitness and cooperation. By analyzing different social structures, such as
authority hierarchies, we show that the culture of cooperation significantly
influences the tribe's performance. Furthermore, we explore how signals not
only facilitate the emergence of culture but also enable its transmission
across generations of agents. Additionally, we examine the benefits of
coordinating behavior and signaling within individual agents' neural networks.

### [47] [Do LLMs Know When to Flip a Coin? Strategic Randomization through Reasoning and Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18928)
*Lingyu Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在战略随机化方面的表现，通过设计一个零和博弈实验，发现不同能力的LLMs在随机化决策上存在差异，并揭示了其战略推理能力的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究常将随机化的认知决策与随机性生成混为一谈，导致对LLMs在战略随机化方面的评估不完整。本文旨在填补这一空白，探究LLMs在复杂博弈中的随机化决策能力。

Method: 设计了一个受田忌赛马启发的零和博弈，其纳什均衡对应最大熵策略。通过三种提示风格（框架化、中立、暗示）评估五种LLMs，使用竞争性多轮游戏隔离随机化决策。

Result: 较弱模型无论提示如何均保持确定性，而较强模型在明确暗示下表现出更多随机化。面对弱模型时，强LLMs采用确定性策略利用偏差；面对同类时则趋近均衡策略。

Conclusion: LLMs的战略推理能力存在显著差异，揭示了在抽象推理和自适应学习方面的改进空间。研究为理解LLMs的决策机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Strategic randomization is a key principle in game theory, yet it remains
underexplored in large language models (LLMs). Prior work often conflates the
cognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,
leading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum
game inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds
to a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from
untrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt
styles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament
gameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to
randomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of
prompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit
hints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to
exploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through
win/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful
variation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities
for improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning. We make our
implementation publicly available at
https://github.com/ocelopus/llm-when-to-throw-coin to ensure full
reproducibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文反驳了Shojaee等人(2025)关于大推理模型(LRMs)存在固有推理能力上限的结论，认为其性能崩溃是实验设计限制所致，而非认知边界。通过工具增强的智能体模型，作者展示了模型能突破原有‘悬崖’并解决更复杂问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Shojaee等人提出的‘推理悬崖’结论，作者认为这是静态文本评估范式的系统级限制所致，而非模型本质缺陷。旨在通过工具增强的智能体范式重新评估模型真实推理能力。

Method: 使用工具增强的智能体模型(如o4-mini和GPT-4o)进行对比实验，突破纯文本生成限制，测试其在复杂任务中的表现，并建立智能体推理能力层级体系。

Result: 工具增强模型成功解决了原研究中‘不可能’的难题，并能处理远超原‘推理悬崖’复杂度的变体，展现出从基础执行到元认知自我修正的多层次推理能力。

Conclusion: LRMs的‘思考假象’源于推理能力与执行工具的不匹配，而非根本性认知缺陷。智能体范式和工具使用对机器智能的评估标准提出新要求。

Abstract: The recent work by Shojaee et al. (2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:
Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of
Problem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,
where the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a
specific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling
limitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while
acknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion
is confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is
not evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable
outcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation
paradigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the
absence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and
output generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens
of an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but
at execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically
substantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,
initially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,
now employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of
complexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.
Additionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and
GPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural
execution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant
implications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion
of thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a
consequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索TabPFN模型在次国家级作物产量预测中的应用潜力，特别是在处理中小型表格数据时的效率和性能表现。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型，结合10天间隔的遥感数据（FAPAR和土壤湿度）和网格化气象数据（气温、降水和辐射），按月聚合数据，并通过留一法交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: TabPFN与传统机器学习模型精度相当，但调参时间显著缩短且特征工程需求更低，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TabPFN因其高效和易用性，成为实际作物产量预测的更优选择。

Abstract: We present an application of a foundation model for small- to medium-sized
tabular data (TabPFN), to sub-national yield forecasting task in South Africa.
TabPFN has recently demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional
machine learning (ML) models in various regression and classification tasks. We
used the dekadal (10-days) time series of Earth Observation (EO; FAPAR and soil
moisture) and gridded weather data (air temperature, precipitation and
radiation) to forecast the yield of summer crops at the sub-national level. The
crop yield data was available for 23 years and for up to 8 provinces. Covariate
variables for TabPFN (i.e., EO and weather) were extracted by region and
aggregated at a monthly scale. We benchmarked the results of the TabPFN against
six ML models and three baseline models. Leave-one-year-out cross-validation
experiment setting was used in order to ensure the assessment of the models
capacity to forecast an unseen year. Results showed that TabPFN and ML models
exhibit comparable accuracy, outperforming the baselines. Nonetheless, TabPFN
demonstrated superior practical utility due to its significantly faster tuning
time and reduced requirement for feature engineering. This renders TabPFN a
more viable option for real-world operation yield forecasting applications,
where efficiency and ease of implementation are paramount.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在结合语言能力和推理任务的游戏中的表现，以评估其复杂问题解决能力。

Method: 评估了六种LLMs，使用三种提示类型，并对两种模型（Mistral、OLMo）进行了微调。

Result: 较大模型（如GPT-4o）表现较好，但小模型难以理解游戏机制；微调提升了分析能力，但未显著改善解决方案生成。

Conclusion: 即使先进或微调的LLMs，动态规则推理仍是挑战，此类游戏适合测试LLMs的推理和反思能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform well on language tasks, but
struggle with reasoning tasks. This paper explores the ability of LLMs to play
the 2D puzzle game Baba is You, in which players manipulate rules by
rearranging text blocks that define object properties. Given that this
rule-manipulation relies on language abilities and reasoning, it is a
compelling challenge for LLMs. Six LLMs are evaluated using different prompt
types, including (1) simple, (2) rule-extended and (3) action-extended prompts.
In addition, two models (Mistral, OLMo) are finetuned using textual and
structural data from the game. Results show that while larger models
(particularly GPT-4o) perform better in reasoning and puzzle solving, smaller
unadapted models struggle to recognize game mechanics or apply rule changes.
Finetuning improves the ability to analyze the game levels, but does not
significantly improve solution formulation. We conclude that even for
state-of-the-art and finetuned LLMs, reasoning about dynamic rule changes is
difficult (specifically, understanding the use-mention distinction). The
results provide insights into the applicability of LLMs to complex
problem-solving tasks and highlight the suitability of games with dynamically
changing rules for testing reasoning and reflection by LLMs.

Motivation: 传统心理健康支持系统仅基于用户当前情绪和情境生成回应，导致干预流于表面，无法满足深层情感需求。

Method: 研究整合《薄伽梵歌》精神智慧与GPT-4o，构建GITes数据集，并提出新的精神洞察力指标，通过LLM陪审团框架自动化评估。

Result: 最佳模型Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct在ROUGE、METEOR、BERT分数及精神洞察力等指标上均有显著提升，最高达126.53%。

Conclusion: 结合精神指导的AI系统在提升用户满意度和支持效果方面潜力巨大，但需进一步在真实患者群体中验证。

Abstract: Traditional mental health support systems often generate responses based
solely on the user's current emotion and situations, resulting in superficial
interventions that fail to address deeper emotional needs. This study
introduces a novel framework by integrating spiritual wisdom from the Bhagavad
Gita with advanced large language model GPT-4o to enhance emotional well-being.
We present the GITes (Gita Integrated Therapy for Emotional Support) dataset,
which enhances the existing ExTES mental health dataset by including 10,729
spiritually guided responses generated by GPT-4o and evaluated by domain
experts. We benchmark GITes against 12 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both
mental health specific and general purpose models. To evaluate spiritual
relevance in generated responses beyond what conventional n-gram based metrics
capture, we propose a novel Spiritual Insight metric and automate assessment
via an LLM as jury framework using chain-of-thought prompting. Integrating
spiritual guidance into AI driven support enhances both NLP and spiritual
metrics for the best performing LLM Phi3-Mini 3.2B Instruct, achieving
improvements of 122.71% in ROUGE, 126.53% in METEOR, 8.15% in BERT score,
15.92% in Spiritual Insight, 18.61% in Sufficiency and 13.22% in Relevance
compared to its zero-shot counterpart. While these results reflect substantial
improvements across automated empathy and spirituality metrics, further
validation in real world patient populations remains a necessary step. Our
findings indicate a strong potential for AI systems enriched with spiritual
guidance to enhance user satisfaction and perceived support outcomes. The code
and dataset will be publicly available to advance further research in this
emerging area.

Motivation: 旨在构建一个数学严谨的AI系统框架，通过竞争和信念调整使代理群体逐步逼近真实知识，解决知识演化中的可验证性问题。

Method: 结合贝叶斯推断、测度论和群体动力学，代理通过竞争（优胜劣汰）和因果推理算子更新信念，采用哈希加密确保可追溯性。

Conclusion: 该系统为可计算的自调节群体智能提供了理论基础，验证了对抗机制下可验证知识的涌现特性。

Abstract: We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework for an artificial
intelligence system composed of probabilistic agents evolving through
structured competition and belief revision. The architecture, grounded in
Bayesian inference, measure theory, and population dynamics, defines agent
fitness as a function of alignment with a fixed external oracle representing
ground truth. Agents compete in a discrete-time environment, adjusting
posterior beliefs through observed outcomes, with higher-rated agents
reproducing and lower-rated agents undergoing extinction. Ratings are updated
via pairwise truth-aligned utility comparisons, and belief updates preserve
measurable consistency and stochastic convergence. We introduce hash-based
cryptographic identity commitments to ensure traceability, alongside causal
inference operators using do-calculus. Formal theorems on convergence,
robustness, and evolutionary stability are provided. The system establishes
truth as an evolutionary attractor, demonstrating that verifiable knowledge
arises from adversarial epistemic pressure within a computable, self-regulating
swarm.

Motivation: 现有图粗化方法主要基于谱保持视角，忽略了图的多粒度特性，导致粗化效果和效率不足。

Method: GBGC引入自适应粒度球细化机制，将原始图从粗到细分割为不同大小的粒度球，并以超节点构建粗化图。

Result: GBGC处理速度提升数十至数百倍，且因粒度球计算的鲁棒性，其精度通常高于原始图。

Conclusion: GBGC有望成为标准图数据预处理方法，因其高效性、自适应性和优越的粗化效果。

Abstract: The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable
graphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work
were mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some
predefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of
the original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,
they largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of
subregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and
similar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the
coarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the
graph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To
this end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in
multi-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive
coarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the
coarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive
granular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original
graph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal
granularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as
supernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening
methods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to
hundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost
always higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and
generalization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to
become a standard graph data preprocessing method.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统存在过滤气泡、外部知识利用不足及模型优化与业务策略迭代脱节的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）赋予基础推荐能力，强化学习（GRPO）结合思维链（CoT）机制优化多目标决策。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上，RecLLM-R1在准确性、多样性和新颖性等指标上显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: RecLLM-R1有效缓解过滤气泡效应，为复杂业务目标下的推荐模型与策略优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with "filter bubbles",
underutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model
optimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this
paper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1
methodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical
interactions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural
language prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.
Subsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage
involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental
recommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through
multi-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward
function, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,
and other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world
user behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that
RecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum
of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It
effectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue
for the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under
intricate business goals.

Motivation: 通过情绪识别技术增强人机交互，使日历应用能动态适应用户情绪和压力水平，从而提高生产力和参与度。

Method: 采用两种方法：基于生物特征的心率数据（使用LSTM和GRU神经网络）和基于行为的计算机活动分析（如鼠标移动、点击和键盘输入）。

Result: 行为分析方法在鼠标相关情绪分类中准确率约90%；GRU在生物特征方法中表现优于LSTM，效价预测准确率达84.38%。

Conclusion: 行为分析方法在情绪检测中更一致且有效，尤其是鼠标交互；GRU在生物特征分析中表现更优。

Abstract: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has evolved significantly to incorporate
emotion recognition capabilities, creating unprecedented opportunities for
adaptive and personalized user experiences. This paper explores the integration
of emotion detection into calendar applications, enabling user interfaces to
dynamically respond to users' emotional states and stress levels, thereby
enhancing both productivity and engagement. We present and evaluate two
complementary approaches to emotion detection: a biometric-based method
utilizing heart rate (HR) data extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
processed through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
neural networks to predict the emotional dimensions of Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance; and a behavioral method analyzing computer activity through multiple
machine learning models to classify emotions based on fine-grained user
interactions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keystroke patterns. Our
comparative analysis, from real-world datasets, reveals that while both
approaches demonstrate effectiveness, the computer activity-based method
delivers superior consistency and accuracy, particularly for mouse-related
interactions, which achieved approximately 90\% accuracy. Furthermore, GRU
networks outperformed LSTM models in the biometric approach, with Valence
prediction reaching 84.38\% accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程领域的数据集构建依赖人工标注和运行环境配置，导致规模受限（通常仅数千个实例），难以满足下一代LLM智能体对长上下文和持续迭代的需求。

Method: 开发自动化数据整理管道，从2,531个GitHub仓库收集10,169个Python任务实例（含自然语言描述和运行时环境镜像），并精选8,000+已验证的训练轨迹用于微调Skywork-SWE模型。

Result: 模型性能随数据量增长持续提升（无饱和迹象），在SWE-bench测试中达到38.0% pass@1准确率（不使用验证器），结合测试时扩展技术后提升至47.0%，创下32B参数以下模型的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 自动化数据管道能有效扩展软件工程数据集，证明数据规模与模型性能存在持续正相关，发布的Skywork-SWE-32B模型为后续研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Software engineering (SWE) has recently emerged as a crucial testbed for
next-generation LLM agents, demanding inherent capabilities in two critical
dimensions: sustained iterative problem-solving (e.g., >50 interaction rounds)
and long-context dependency resolution (e.g., >32k tokens). However, the data
curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily
relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated
runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most
existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances.
To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that
systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our
dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct
GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language
and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation.
We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training
trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE
model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the
trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs
continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of
saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,
establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based
LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the
incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves
to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter
models. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future

TL;DR: 论文提出FEAT框架，通过混合人工与AI生成教师反馈数据，平衡成本与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI辅导系统需要高质量教师反馈数据，但人工生成成本高且耗时。

Method: 构建三个数据集：DM（人工+AI协作）、DG（纯AI生成）、DA（DG为主+少量DM）。

Result: 实验表明，DG中加入5-10%的DM数据，效果优于纯DM。

Conclusion: FEAT框架能以较低成本生成高质量教师反馈数据。

Abstract: In English education tutoring, teacher feedback is essential for guiding
students. Recently, AI-based tutoring systems have emerged to assist teachers;
however, these systems require high-quality and large-scale teacher feedback
data, which is both time-consuming and costly to generate manually. In this
study, we propose FEAT, a cost-effective framework for generating teacher
feedback, and have constructed three complementary datasets: (1) DIRECT-Manual
(DM), where both humans and large language models (LLMs) collaboratively
generate high-quality teacher feedback, albeit at a higher cost; (2)
DIRECT-Generated (DG), an LLM-only generated, cost-effective dataset with lower
quality;, and (3) DIRECT-Augmented (DA), primarily based on DG with a small
portion of DM added to enhance quality while maintaining cost-efficiency.
Experimental results showed that incorporating a small portion of DM (5-10%)
into DG leads to superior performance compared to using 100% DM alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由机器学习生成游戏关卡时常见的非功能性（如不完整、目标不可达）问题，需在最小修改前提下实现关卡可玩性。

Method: 采用基于搜索的解决方案，重点使用进化算法和质量多样性算法，对PCGML生成的初始关卡进行修复。

Result: 该方法能有效修复机器学习生成的风格匹配但存在缺陷的关卡，混合式PCG方法展现出良好潜力。

Conclusion: 搜索式修复与PCGML生成的结合为程序化内容生成提供了可靠的新途径。

Abstract: We address the problem of game level repair, which consists of taking a
designed but non-functional game level and making it functional. This might
consist of ensuring the completeness of the level, reachability of objects, or
other performance characteristics. The repair problem may also be constrained
in that it can only make a small number of changes to the level. We investigate
search-based solutions to the level repair problem, particularly using
evolutionary and quality-diversity algorithms, with good results. This level
repair method is applied to levels generated using a machine learning-based
procedural content generation (PCGML) method that generates stylistically
appropriate but frequently broken levels. This combination of PCGML for
generation and search-based methods for repair shows great promise as a hybrid
procedural content generation (PCG) method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CID-GraphRAG提出了一种结合意图转换图和语义检索的双重检索机制，显著提升了多轮客服对话的上下文连贯性和目标导向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统在多轮客服对话中难以同时保持上下文连贯性和目标导向性，传统RAG系统仅依赖语义相似性或静态知识图谱，存在局限性。

Method: CID-GraphRAG通过构建动态意图转换图，并采用双重检索机制，自适应平衡基于意图的图遍历和语义搜索。

Result: 实验表明，CID-GraphRAG在自动指标和LLM评估中均显著优于传统方法，尤其在响应质量上提升了58%。

Conclusion: CID-GraphRAG通过整合意图结构和语义检索，有效解决了知识密集型多轮对话中的挑战，实现了协同效应。

Abstract: We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval
Augmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of
existing dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and
goal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike
traditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation
RAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic
intent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements
a dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph
traversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to
simultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual
semantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In
extensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both
automatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG
significantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based
GraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG
demonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic
metrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and
most notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge
evaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent
transition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that
neither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an
effective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual
coherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn
dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体中心表示研究多集中于场景分解，缺乏对学习表示推理能力的评估。机器人操作任务涉及多对象交互，是验证OCR潜力的理想场景。

Method: 在模拟环境中创建多对象机器人操作任务，引入高度随机化因素，并对比经典OCR方法与先进整体表示方法在泛化场景中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在复杂场景中易失败，而物体中心方法能有效应对这些挑战。

Conclusion: 物体中心表示在复杂多对象交互任务中展现出显著优势，为提升机器人操作的泛化能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Object-centric representation (OCR) has recently become a subject of interest
in the computer vision community for learning a structured representation of
images and videos. It has been several times presented as a potential way to
improve data-efficiency and generalization capabilities to learn an agent on
downstream tasks. However, most existing work only evaluates such models on
scene decomposition, without any notion of reasoning over the learned
representation. Robotic manipulation tasks generally involve multi-object
environments with potential inter-object interaction. We thus argue that they
are a very interesting playground to really evaluate the potential of existing
object-centric work. To do so, we create several robotic manipulation tasks in
simulated environments involving multiple objects (several distractors, the
robot, etc.) and a high-level of randomization (object positions, colors,
shapes, background, initial positions, etc.). We then evaluate one classical
object-centric method across several generalization scenarios and compare its
results against several state-of-the-art hollistic representations. Our results
exhibit that existing methods are prone to failure in difficult scenarios
involving complex scene structures, whereas object-centric methods help
overcome these challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在许多NLP任务中表现优异，但在讽刺理解方面仍存在困难，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用军事指挥理论启发的模块化决策路由框架，协调多个专用LLM代理分工处理子任务，并由中央指挥官整合信息进行最终判断。

Result: 在MMSD和MMSD 2.0基准测试中，F1分数分别比现有最佳方法平均提高4.4%和11.7%。

Conclusion: Commander-GPT框架有效提升了多模态讽刺理解的性能，证明了模块化分工策略的优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm understanding is a high-order cognitive task. Although
large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on many
downstream NLP tasks, growing evidence suggests that they struggle with sarcasm
understanding. In this paper, we propose Commander-GPT, a modular decision
routing framework inspired by military command theory. Rather than relying on a
single LLM's capability, Commander-GPT orchestrates a team of specialized LLM
agents where each agent will be selectively assigned to a focused sub-task such
as context modeling, sentiment analysis, etc. Their outputs are then routed
back to the commander, which integrates the information and performs the final
sarcasm judgment. To coordinate these agents, we introduce three types of
centralized commanders: (1) a trained lightweight encoder-based commander
(e.g., multi-modal BERT); (2) four small autoregressive language models,
serving as moderately capable commanders (e.g., DeepSeek-VL); (3) two large
LLM-based commander (Gemini Pro and GPT-4o) that performs task routing, output
aggregation, and sarcasm decision-making in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate
Commander-GPT on the MMSD and MMSD 2.0 benchmarks, comparing five prompting
strategies. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 4.4% and
11.7% improvement in F1 score over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines on
average, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: NaviAgent提出了一种基于图导航的双层规划架构，通过多路径决策和图编码导航器优化工具调用，显著提升任务成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态知识和单一执行路径，导致错误恢复能力差且搜索空间爆炸，难以应对复杂异构工具链的编排需求。

Method: 采用双层架构：多路径决策器动态选择最优动作；图编码导航器构建工具依赖异构图，融合API结构和历史调用行为，结合启发式搜索策略。

Result: 在多个基础模型上任务成功率最高（平均提升13.5%-19%），执行步骤接近最优基线，微调模型性能甚至超越更大模型。图编码导航器进一步带来2.4-9个点的提升。

Conclusion: NaviAgent通过动态决策和图结构学习实现了工具链编排的质量-效率平衡，其架构设计对复杂任务和大模型尤为关键。

Abstract: LLMs' reliance on static knowledge and fragile tool invocation severely
hinders the orchestration of complex, heterogeneous toolchains, particularly at
large scales. Existing methods typically use rigid single-path execution,
resulting in poor error recovery and exponentially growing search spaces. We
introduce NaviAgent, a graph-navigated bilevel planning architecture for robust
function calling, comprising a Multi-Path Decider and Graph-Encoded Navigator.
As an LLM-powered agent, the Multi-Path Decider defines a four-dimensional
decision space and continuously perceives environmental states, dynamically
selecting the optimal action to fully cover all tool invocation scenarios. The
Graph-Encoded Navigator constructs a Tool Dependency Heterogeneous Graph
(TDHG), where node embeddings explicitly fuse API schema structure with
historical invocation behavior. It also integrates a novel heuristic search
strategy that guides the Decider toward efficient and highly successful
toolchains, even for unseen tool combinations. Experiments show that NaviAgent
consistently achieves the highest task success rate (TSR) across all foundation
models and task complexities, outperforming the average baselines (ReAct,
ToolLLM, {\alpha}-UMI) by 13.5%, 16.4%, and 19.0% on Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-32B,
and Deepseek-V3, respectively. Its execution steps are typically within one
step of the most efficient baseline, ensuring a strong balance between quality
and efficiency. Notably, a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model achieves a TSR of
49.5%, surpassing the much larger 32B model (44.9%) under our architecture.
Incorporating the Graph-Encoded Navigator further boosts TSR by an average of
2.4 points, with gains up over 9 points on complex tasks for larger models
(Deepseek-V3 and GPT-4o), highlighting its essential role in toolchain
orchestration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于强化学习的D&D战斗遭遇生成方法NTRL，能自动调整难度并提升战斗策略性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: D&D中平衡战斗遭遇需要DM手动评估，过程复杂且易打断叙事流程，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用上下文多臂老虎机框架，根据实时队伍属性生成遭遇，通过强化学习迭代优化设计。

Result: NTRL显著延长战斗时长(+200%)，增加玩家伤害(-16.67%战后HP)，在保持70%胜率的同时提升战术深度。

Conclusion: NTRL在保持游戏公平性的前提下，比人工DM更能增强战斗策略性与难度，优化游戏体验。

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a complex task
that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy
composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the
narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via
Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic
Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&D via combat encounter design. By framing the
problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time
party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL
iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases
damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and
raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills
(TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in
tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win
rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon
Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic
depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall
game fairness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗中，机器学习模型的高性能往往伴随着不透明性，而符号方法虽然可解释但预测能力有限。因此，需要一种既能保持高准确性又能提供解释的混合方法。

Method: 论文采用了一种混合方法，将FOLD-R++算法生成的ASP规则与黑盒机器学习分类器结合，选择性修正不确定预测并提供可读解释。

Result: 在五个医疗数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和F1分数上取得了统计显著的提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合符号推理与传统机器学习可以在不牺牲准确性的情况下实现高可解释性，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains
such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance
decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks
and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In
parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the
possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the
predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that
integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML
classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide
human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal
statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This
study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with
conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: TAPAS在基准规划领域和VirtualHome模拟环境中表现出色。

Conclusion: TAPAS通过动态生成计划和自然语言翻译，有效连接了规划与现实机器人能力。

Abstract: We introduce TAPAS (Task-based Adaptation and Planning using AgentS), a
multi-agent framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with
symbolic planning to solve complex tasks without the need for manually defined
environment models. TAPAS employs specialized LLM-based agents that
collaboratively generate and adapt domain models, initial states, and goal
specifications as needed using structured tool-calling mechanisms. Through this
tool-based interaction, downstream agents can request modifications from
upstream agents, enabling adaptation to novel attributes and constraints
without manual domain redefinition. A ReAct (Reason+Act)-style execution agent,
coupled with natural language plan translation, bridges the gap between
dynamically generated plans and real-world robot capabilities. TAPAS
demonstrates strong performance in benchmark planning domains and in the
VirtualHome simulated real-world environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在增量学习场景中难以跨领域保持性能，且现有提示学习方法多关注类增量学习，缺乏多领域任务增量学习策略，且多为单模态提示，未充分利用跨模态信息交互。

Method: 提出ChordPrompt框架，引入跨模态提示以利用视觉与文本信息的交互，并采用领域自适应文本提示实现多领域持续适应。

Result: 在多领域增量学习基准测试中，ChordPrompt在零样本泛化和下游任务性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ChordPrompt通过跨模态和领域自适应的提示设计，有效提升了视觉语言模型在多领域增量学习中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt
effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without
comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While
vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain
performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt
learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on
class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for
multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ
single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal
information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt
framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual
prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions
between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs
domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual
adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain
incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task
performance.

Conclusion: ISLs是克服科学发现当前限制并实现AI驱动科学全面潜力的关键。

Abstract: Scientific discovery has long been constrained by human limitations in
expertise, physical capability, and sleep cycles. The recent rise of AI
scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and
operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems
are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack
the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical
world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation
models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning,
and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and
embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems
that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of
serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of
Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework
that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify
foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration,
and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such
systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific
discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven
science.

TL;DR: 本文证明了在允许循环的DMG结构中，do-calculus对识别宏观因果效应具有无条件可靠性和完备性，扩展了现有理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实系统中常存在循环因果结构，而传统ADMG框架无法处理此类场景下高维因果关系的抽象表示问题。

Method: 采用输入-输出结构因果模型(ioSCMs)生成DMG图，并研究其上的集群有向混合图(C-DMGs)的因果效应识别理论。

Result: 证明do-calculus在DMG上的C-DMGs中具有可靠性和完备性，且非可识别性判定标准可自然推广至部分DMG场景。

Conclusion: 该研究为循环因果系统提供了理论支持，扩展了do-calculus在抽象因果表示中的适用范围。

Abstract: The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects
in acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models
(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in
high-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often
infeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified
causal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs
(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet
practical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include
cycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete
for identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the
assumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world
systems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To
account for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been
introduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce
another type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).
Analogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level
representations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,
we prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally
sound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.
Furthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of
macro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends
to a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类和动物能高效学习并快速适应新环境，而传统强化学习算法依赖增量式价值更新，无法很好捕捉这一能力。研究旨在探索情景记忆如何作为计算资源支持快速适应。

Method: 使用Transformer在受啮齿类行为启发的规划任务分布中进行上下文强化学习训练，并分析模型涌现的学习算法。

Result: 模型通过上下文结构学习和跨上下文对齐实现表征学习，其强化学习策略不可解释为标准的无模型或基于模型的规划，而是依赖内存令牌缓存中间计算。模型表征与海马-内嗅系统计算相似。

Conclusion: 内存可作为存储原始经验和缓存计算的计算资源支持灵活行为，研究为人工和自然场景下的上下文快速适应机制提供了假设。

Abstract: Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new
environments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by
standard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value
updates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to
retrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.
Transformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of
their ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value
architecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a
transformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning
tasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms
that emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is
supported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where
representations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.
We next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the
model are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.
Instead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching
intermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then
accessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a
computational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to
support flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the
model resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system
in the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural
cognition. Taken together, our work offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the
rapid adaptation that underlies in-context learning in artificial and natural

*Zhuojun Xie,Adam Abdin,Yiping Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种集成估计优化（IEO）框架，通过联合调整预测模型并直接优化维护结果，解决了传统估计后优化（ETO）框架中预测误差导致的维护决策不一致和次优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习在预测性维护（PdM）中的应用日益增多，但模型误设带来的不确定性限制了其工业广泛应用。论文旨在解决预测准确性不必然带来更好维护决策的问题，并减少预测误差对维护决策的影响。

Method: 论文提出IEO框架，结合随机扰动梯度下降算法，联合优化预测模型和维护决策，特别适用于小样本的故障数据集。

Result: 在涡轮风扇维护案例中，IEO框架比ETO平均减少22%的维护遗憾，显著提升了决策质量和模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IEO框架通过将预测模型训练与维护目标对齐，有效管理预测误差，提升了不确定操作环境下维护规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive
maintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich
operational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification
continues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM
framework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under
economic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key
questions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better
maintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on
downstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the
traditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic
prediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To
address this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that
jointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance
outcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision
consistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic
perturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure
datasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that
the IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.
This study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in
data-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance
objectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification
and improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when
the decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.
These findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain
operational environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLaMA-v3的医疗文档分析平台，通过低秩适配优化，专注于鉴别诊断任务，解决了隐私和性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗文档分析对临床诊断至关重要，但现有大型语言模型（LLMs）存在隐私问题，无法在临床环境中安全使用。

Method: 使用低秩适配（LoRA）微调LLaMA-v3模型，并利用DDXPlus数据集优化鉴别诊断任务。

Result: 该方法在病理预测和变长鉴别诊断中表现优于现有技术，并通过可解释性技术提升用户信任。

Conclusion: 该研究为医疗文档分析提供了可靠、可解释且保护隐私的AI解决方案，具有重要临床应用价值。

Abstract: Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential
clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical
tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition
among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical
expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy
concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs
services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a
trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using
low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.
Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential
diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and
variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The
developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured
medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By
incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures
transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.
Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current
state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility
in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable,
explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions,
representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis
for real-world healthcare applications. The code can be found at

TL;DR: AutoExperiment是一个新基准，用于评估AI代理根据研究论文的自然语言描述实现和运行机器学习实验的能力，发现随着缺失代码量的增加，性能迅速下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏评估AI代理在不同代码起点下实现科学想法的基准，AutoExperiment填补了这一空白，旨在衡量AI在科学实验中的代码生成和执行能力。

Method: 通过提供研究论文、部分代码被屏蔽的代码库和运行命令，要求AI代理生成缺失代码并在沙盒环境中执行实验，难度随缺失函数数量n的增加而递增。

Result: 实验表明，随着n的增加，AI代理性能迅速下降；能动态与环境交互的代理表现优于固定框架下的代理，且单次与多次尝试成功率存在显著差距。

Conclusion: AutoExperiment揭示了长周期代码生成、上下文检索和自主实验执行中的关键挑战，为评估AI驱动的科学实验进展设立了新基准。

Abstract: Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI
agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments.
However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can
implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting
point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch
replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce
AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and
run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in
research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase
with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is
to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed
environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by
varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction
to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that
performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically
interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents
in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between
single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating
verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical
challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous
experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for
evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code
are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工设计针对特定任务的提示（prompt）费时且易受模型微小变化影响，因此探索自动提示优化技术以解决这一问题。

Method: 通过实验评估不同设置（如提示策略、LLM选择、模式复杂度、文本长度等），比较三种自动提示优化工具（DSPy、APE、TextGrad）在SynthIE和REBEL数据集上的表现。

Result: 自动提示优化技术能产生接近人工设计的合理提示，尤其在模式复杂度和文本规模增加时表现更优。

Conclusion: 自动提示优化可有效替代手工设计，提升知识图谱三元组抽取任务的性能。

Abstract: A KG represents a network of entities and illustrates relationships between
them. KGs are used for various applications, including semantic search and
discovery, reasoning, decision-making, natural language processing, machine
learning, and recommendation systems. Triple (subject-relation-object)
extraction from text is the fundamental building block of KG construction and
has been widely studied, for example, in early benchmarks such as ACE 2002 to
more recent ones, such as WebNLG 2020, REBEL and SynthIE. While the use of LLMs
is explored for KG construction, handcrafting reasonable task-specific prompts
for LLMs is a labour-intensive exercise and can be brittle due to subtle
changes in the LLM models employed. Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy
generation) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this
challenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given
input-output examples.
  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt
optimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking. We
evaluate different settings by changing (a) the prompting strategy, (b) the LLM
being used for prompt optimization and task execution, (c) the number of
canonical relations in the schema (schema complexity), (d) the length and
diversity of input text, (e) the metric used to drive the prompt optimization,
and (f) the dataset being used for training and testing. We evaluate three
different automatic prompt optimizers, namely, DSPy, APE, and TextGrad and use
two different triple extraction datasets, SynthIE and REBEL. Through rigorous
empirical evaluation, our main contribution highlights that automatic prompt
optimization techniques can generate reasonable prompts similar to humans for
triple extraction. In turn, these optimized prompts achieve improved results,
particularly with increasing schema complexity and text size.

TL;DR: 论文提出SAGE方法，通过专家策略引导LLM优化查询重写，结合新型奖励机制提升检索效果并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密集检索的查询重写方法依赖大规模监督数据或存在强化学习探索效率低的问题，需更高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 引入SAGE框架，将专家策略（如语义扩展、实体消歧）融入强化学习，并设计SCS和CRS两种奖励机制优化学习信号。

Result: 在HotpotQA等基准上取得SOTA的NDCG@10结果，同时模型能自主选择最优策略，减少冗余探索并降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 策略引导的强化学习结合精细奖励机制，为构建高效、可解释的新一代信息检索系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Query rewriting is pivotal for enhancing dense retrieval, yet current methods
demand large-scale supervised data or suffer from inefficient reinforcement
learning (RL) exploration. In this work, we first establish that guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a concise set of expert-crafted strategies, such as
semantic expansion and entity disambiguation, substantially improves retrieval
effectiveness on challenging benchmarks, including HotpotQA, FEVER, NFCorpus,
and SciFact. Building on this insight, we introduce the Strategy-Adaptive
Generation Engine (SAGE), which operationalizes these strategies in an RL
framework. SAGE introduces two novel reward shaping mechanisms-Strategic Credit
Shaping (SCS) and Contrastive Reward Shaping (CRS)-to deliver more informative
learning signals. This strategy-guided approach not only achieves new
state-of-the-art NDCG@10 results, but also uncovers a compelling emergent
behavior: the agent learns to select optimal strategies, reduces unnecessary
exploration, and generates concise rewrites, lowering inference cost without
sacrificing performance. Our findings demonstrate that strategy-guided RL,
enhanced with nuanced reward shaping, offers a scalable, efficient, and more
interpretable paradigm for developing the next generation of robust information
retrieval systems.

TL;DR: 提出SimBelief框架，通过任务信念相似性度量提升稀疏奖励环境下的元强化学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯自适应深度强化学习方法在稀疏奖励环境中因依赖奖励信号重建而表现不佳，需更鲁棒的任务识别方法。

Method: 基于双模拟度量思想，在BAMDP中设计潜在任务信念度量，学习任务分布的共享潜在动态结构。

Result: 在稀疏奖励MuJoCo和panda-gym任务上超越当前最优基线方法。

Conclusion: SimBelief通过任务信念相似性度量有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的快速任务适应问题。

Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning requires utilizing prior task distribution
information obtained during exploration to rapidly adapt to unknown tasks. The
efficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the
current task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on
reconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse
reward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation
metrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we
propose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task
belief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common
features of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification
and exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief
metric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into
the specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task
distributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task
features, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowRL通过将基于知识验证的事实性奖励整合到强化学习训练中，有效减少慢思考模型中的幻觉问题，同时保持其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（尤其是慢思考模型）在推理过程中常因无法准确识别知识边界而产生严重幻觉，输出错误内容。强化学习虽能提升复杂推理能力，但其结果导向的奖励机制缺乏对思考过程的事实监督，进一步加剧了幻觉问题。

Method: 提出KnowRL方法，通过将基于验证的知识事实性奖励整合到强化学习训练中，引导模型进行基于事实的慢思考，帮助其识别知识边界。

Result: 在三个幻觉评估数据集和两个推理评估数据集上的实验结果表明，KnowRL有效减少了慢思考模型中的幻觉，同时保持了其原有的强大推理能力。

Conclusion: KnowRL通过强化学习中的事实性奖励机制，显著降低了慢思考模型的幻觉问题，同时不损害其推理性能，为模型可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often
exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability
to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its
outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the
thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address
the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced
RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by
integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL
training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL
guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality
reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping
them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during
RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning
strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning
steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on
three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets
demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking
models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code
is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决研究人员因不熟悉或不遵守数据可视化原则而导致的图表信息不准确或不完整的问题。

Method: 研究采用五种开源视觉语言模型（VLMs）和五种提示策略，通过从数据可视化指南中提取的问题集来评估VLMs的适用性。

Result: 结果显示，VLMs在识别图表类型、3D效果、轴标签等方面表现良好（F1分数82.49%至98.55%），但在图像质量和刻度标记方面表现较差（F1分数0.74%和46.13%）。Qwen2.5VL模型和总结性提示策略表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，VLMs可用于自动识别图表中的潜在问题，如缺失轴标签、图例和不必要的3D效果。该方法可进一步扩展用于数据可视化的其他方面。

Abstract: Diagrams are widely used to visualize data in publications. The research
field of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for
the creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to
by researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or
incomplete information.
  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze
diagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data
visualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs
for these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are
compared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization
guidelines.
  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze
diagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels
(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score
96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the
image quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among
the employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting
strategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.
  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of
potential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and
unnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for
further aspects of data visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测港口拥堵对维持全球供应链的可靠性至关重要，准确的预测可以优化运输计划、减少延误和成本，并提升供应链韧性。

Method: 利用历史AIS数据重建泊位调度，通过逆向强化学习（IRL）确定奖励函数，并开发Temporal-IRL模型学习泊位调度以预测船舶序列和停泊时间。

Result: 使用纽约/新泽西港Maher Terminal 2015年1月至2023年9月的数据训练和测试模型，取得了显著优异的结果。

Conclusion: Temporal-IRL模型能有效预测港口拥堵，为供应链管理提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Predicting port congestion is crucial for maintaining reliable global supply
chains. Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand
costs, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely
deliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate
predictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port
terminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various
conditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying
priorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are
influenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting
times, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing
historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we
reconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we
modeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed
Temporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel
sequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both
waiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion. Utilizing data from
Maher Terminal spanning January 2015 to September 2023, we trained and tested
the model, achieving demonstrably excellent results.

Result: 实验表明，JoyAgents-R1在通用和特定领域场景中性能媲美更大规模的LLM，同时基于较小的开源模型实现。

Conclusion: JoyAgents-R1有效提升了异构多智能体强化学习的协作效率和训练稳定性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm
for increasingly complex tasks. However, joint evolution across heterogeneous
agents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training
instability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL
called JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively
refining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves
holistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.
Specifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on
the behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO
sampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal
benefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with
maximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve
training stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter
adjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution
mechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to
eliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across
general and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves
performance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller
open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL方法在处理多表连接、嵌套条件等复杂查询时存在计算成本高、延迟大和错误传播的问题，需要一种更高效、准确的解决方案。

Method: HI-SQL通过分析历史查询日志生成上下文提示，指导SQL生成过程，避免了多步骤流水线的高成本和错误传播。

Conclusion: HI-SQL为增强Text-to-SQL系统提供了一种高效、实用的解决方案，能够有效应对复杂查询的挑战。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation bridges the gap between natural language and
databases, enabling users to query data without requiring SQL expertise. While
large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field, challenges
remain in handling complex queries that involve multi-table joins, nested
conditions, and intricate operations. Existing methods often rely on multi-step
pipelines that incur high computational costs, increase latency, and are prone
to error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose HI-SQL, a
pipeline that incorporates a novel hint generation mechanism utilizing
historical query logs to guide SQL generation. By analyzing prior queries, our
method generates contextual hints that focus on handling the complexities of
multi-table and nested operations. These hints are seamlessly integrated into
the SQL generation process, eliminating the need for costly multi-step
approaches and reducing reliance on human-crafted prompts. Experimental
evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves query accuracy of LLM-generated queries while ensuring
efficiency in terms of LLM calls and latency, offering a robust and practical
solution for enhancing Text-to-SQL systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出SPLoRA方法，通过剪枝选择性移除降低安全对齐的LoRA层，提升大语言模型安全性同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适应（LoRA）微调方法会损害大语言模型的安全对齐性，即使使用良性数据也会增加有害输出的风险，且现有安全对齐技术难以捕捉复杂参数变化。

Method: 提出基于剪枝的SPLoRA方法，引入E-DIEM相似度度量检测安全失配，选择性剪枝削弱安全性的LoRA层。

Result: 实验表明SPLoRA在安全性和性能上优于现有技术，显著降低安全风险且不增加推理开销。

Conclusion: SPLoRA是可扩展的高效解决方案，能部署更可靠的大语言模型。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
enhances adaptability while reducing computational costs. However, fine-tuning
can compromise safety alignment, even with benign data, increasing
susceptibility to harmful outputs. Existing safety alignment methods struggle
to capture complex parameter shifts, leading to suboptimal safety-utility
trade-offs. To address this issue, we propose Safe Pruning LoRA (SPLoRA), a
novel pruning-based approach that selectively removes LoRA layers that weaken
safety alignment, improving safety while preserving performance. At its core,
we introduce Empirical-DIEM (E-DIEM), a dimension-insensitive similarity metric
that effectively detects safety misalignment in LoRA-adapted models. We conduct
extensive experiments on LLMs fine-tuned with mixed of benign and malicious
data, and purely benign datasets, evaluating SPLoRA across utility, safety, and
reliability metrics. Results demonstrate that SPLoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art safety alignment techniques, significantly reducing safety
risks while maintaining or improving model performance and reliability.
Additionally, SPLoRA reduces inference overhead, making it a scalable and
efficient solution for deploying safer and more reliable LLMs. The code is

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Experts (CoE)架构，通过层内专家顺序通信提升模型表现，相比传统MoE在数学推理任务上验证损失从1.20降至1.12，并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型中专家并行独立操作，缺乏动态交互，限制了模型的表示能力和专家组合多样性。

Method: CoE在每层内引入顺序专家链，每个迭代步骤使用专用路由器选择专家，支持动态专家选择和迭代残差结构。

Result: 在固定计算量下，CoE在数学推理任务上表现更优，验证损失降低，内存使用减少17.6-42%。

Conclusion: CoE通过迭代路由和专家专业化增强了模型表示能力，提供了一种新的扩展轴（深度迭代），优于传统宽度/深度扩展。

Abstract: We propose Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture that introduces sequential expert communication within each layer.
Unlike traditional MoE models, where experts operate independently in parallel,
CoE processes tokens iteratively across a chain of experts inside a layer. To
support dynamic expert selection across iterations, CoE employs a dedicated
router at each iteration step within a layer. This design allows tokens to
re-evaluate and select different experts during each iteration, rather than
being statically assigned. As a result, CoE introduces a flexible routing
mechanism that increases the diversity of expert combinations and enriches the
model's representational capacity. CoE demonstrates improved performance under
fixed compute: on math reasoning tasks, it reduces validation loss from 1.20 to
1.12 compared to a standard MoE. Beyond performance, CoE offers a new scaling
axis: depth through expert iteration, which complements conventional
width/depth scaling. For example, using 2x iterations matches the performance
of 3x expert selections (in width), while reducing memory usage by 17.6-42%
relative to other scaling strategies. Our analysis reveals that CoE's benefits
stem from its iterative residual structure and enhanced expert specialization
empowered by iterative routing, which together unlock more expressive
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/ZihanWang314/coe.

TL;DR: 提出混合特征注意力-人工神经网络(MFA-ANN)模型，通过多模态特征融合实现注塑产品重量的高精度在线预测，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决注塑质量异常检测不及时和在线监测滞后的问题，提升质量控制效率。

Method: 结合机理分析与数据驱动方法，使用时序与非时序数据分层特征提取，并嵌入自注意力机制动态校准特征权重。

Result: 模型RMSE达0.0281，比传统方法提升15.6%-25.7%，消融实验证明混合特征建模贡献22.4%性能提升。

Conclusion: MFA-ANN为注塑过程智能质量控制提供了高效可靠解决方案，数据分辨率对预测可靠性影响显著。

Abstract: To address the challenges of untimely detection and online monitoring lag in
injection molding quality anomalies, this study proposes a mixed feature
attention-artificial neural network (MFA-ANN) model for high-precision online
prediction of product weight. By integrating mechanism-based with data-driven
analysis, the proposed architecture decouples time series data (e.g., melt flow
dynamics, thermal profiles) from non-time series data (e.g., mold features,
pressure settings), enabling hierarchical feature extraction. A self-attention
mechanism is strategically embedded during cross-domain feature fusion to
dynamically calibrate inter-modality feature weights, thereby emphasizing
critical determinants of weight variability. The results demonstrate that the
MFA-ANN model achieves a RMSE of 0.0281 with 0.5 g weight fluctuation
tolerance, outperforming conventional benchmarks: a 25.1% accuracy improvement
over non-time series ANN models, 23.0% over LSTM networks, 25.7% over SVR, and
15.6% over RF models, respectively. Ablation studies quantitatively validate
the synergistic enhancement derived from the integration of mixed feature
modeling (contributing 22.4%) and the attention mechanism (contributing 11.2%),
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to varying working conditions
and its resistance to noise. Moreover, critical sensitivity analyses further
reveal that data resolution significantly impacts prediction reliability,
low-fidelity sensor inputs degrade performance by 23.8% RMSE compared to
high-precision measurements. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
reliable solution for the intelligent quality control of injection molding
processes.

Result: 在GSM8K和ARC基准上分别提升17.6%和10.5%，并在Jetson Nano等设备上降低延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: HOLA证明了其可扩展性和生产就绪性，适用于医疗、教育等实时场景。

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is constrained by high
compute and memory demands posing a barrier for real-time applications in
sectors like healthcare, education, and embedded systems. Current solutions
such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer
only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We
introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM
deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD)
for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts
retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends
structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains:
17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge
devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.

Abstract: Bridges, as critical components of civil infrastructure, are increasingly
affected by deterioration, making reliable traffic monitoring essential for
assessing their remaining service life. Among operational loads, traffic load
plays a pivotal role, and recent advances in deep learning - particularly in
computer vision (CV) - have enabled progress toward continuous, automated
monitoring. However, CV-based approaches suffer from limitations, including
privacy concerns and sensitivity to lighting conditions, while traditional
non-vision-based methods often lack flexibility in deployment and validation.
To bridge this gap, we propose a fully automated deep-learning pipeline for
continuous traffic monitoring using structural health monitoring (SHM) sensor
networks. Our approach integrates CV-assisted high-resolution dataset
generation with supervised training and inference, leveraging graph neural
networks (GNNs) to capture the spatial structure and interdependence of sensor
data. By transferring knowledge from CV outputs to SHM sensors, the proposed
framework enables sensor networks to achieve comparable accuracy of
vision-based systems, with minimal human intervention. Applied to accelerometer
and strain gauge data in a real-world case study, the model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with classification accuracies of 99% for light
vehicles and 94% for heavy vehicles.

Result: 可学习掩码方法在动态时间序列预测中提供更可靠、一致的解释，优于梯度、遮挡和置换方法。

Conclusion: 可学习掩码方法适用于重症监护等领域，为动态预测任务提供更优的解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretability plays a vital role in aligning and deploying deep learning
models in critical care, especially in constantly evolving conditions that
influence patient survival. However, common interpretability algorithms face
unique challenges when applied to dynamic prediction tasks, where patient
trajectories evolve over time. Gradient, Occlusion, and Permutation-based
methods often struggle with time-varying target dependency and temporal
smoothness. This work systematically analyzes these failure modes and supports
learnable mask-based interpretability frameworks as alternatives, which can
incorporate temporal continuity and label consistency constraints to learn
feature importance over time. Here, we propose that learnable mask-based
approaches for dynamic timeseries prediction problems provide more reliable and
consistent interpretations for applications in critical care and similar
domains.

Result: 生成数据在因果公平性指标上偏离真实数据小于10%，训练后敏感属性偏差降低70%。

Conclusion: 该方法为公平健康研究和医疗提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation creates data based on real-world data using
generative models. In health applications, generating high-quality data while
maintaining fairness for sensitive attributes is essential for equitable
outcomes. Existing GAN-based and LLM-based methods focus on counterfactual
fairness and are primarily applied in finance and legal domains. Causal
fairness provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework by preserving
causal structure, but current synthetic data generation methods do not address
it in health settings. To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented
synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world
tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real
data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors,
synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real
data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable
health research and healthcare delivery.

Conclusion: 基础模型在地球科学中的重要质量指标是其能否无需全微调即可扩展到新变量，为计算资源有限的社区提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI weather forecasting have led to the emergence of
so-called "foundation models", typically defined by expensive pretraining and
minimal fine-tuning for downstream tasks. However, in the natural sciences, a
desirable foundation model should also encode meaningful statistical
relationships between the underlying physical variables. This study evaluates
the performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting
hydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We
introduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent
representations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables. As a
baseline, we compare this to fine-tuning the full model, which allows further
optimization of the latent space while incorporating new variables into both
inputs and outputs. The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time
and 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various
hydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation
model, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on
the physical correlation between the new variables and those used during
pretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical
relationships. In this sense, we argue that an important quality metric for
foundation models in Earth sciences is their ability to be extended to new
variables without a full fine-tuning. This provides a new perspective for
making foundation models more accessible to communities with limited
computational resources, while supporting broader adoption in Earth sciences.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在数学上能表示什么，特别是ReLU网络的表达能力，以理解其作为算法的潜力。

Method: 采用构造性方法，将神经网络视为算法而非数据训练产物，构建了能精确排序的神经网络等示例。

Result: 发现构造的神经网络通常具有递归和并行特性，深度网络优于浅层网络，但受限于连续性。

Conclusion: ReLU网络作为算法具有独特优势，尤其在深度结构中，但连续性限制了其表达能力。

Abstract: It is difficult to describe in mathematical terms what a neural network
trained on data represents. On the other hand, there is a growing mathematical
understanding of what neural networks are in principle capable of representing.
Feedforward neural networks using the ReLU activation function represent
continuous and piecewise linear functions and can approximate many others. The
study of their expressivity addresses the question: which ones? Contributing to
the available answers, we take the perspective of a neural network as an
algorithm. In this analogy, a neural network is programmed constructively,
rather than trained from data. An interesting example is a sorting algorithm:
we explicitly construct a neural network that sorts its inputs exactly, not
approximately, and that, in a sense, has optimal computational complexity if
the input dimension is large. Such constructed networks may have several
billion parameters. We construct and analyze several other examples, both
existing and new. We find that, in these examples, neural networks as
algorithms are typically recursive and parallel. Compared to conventional
algorithms, ReLU networks are restricted by having to be continuous. Moreover,
the depth of recursion is limited by the depth of the network, with deep
networks having superior properties over shallow ones.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer在多个AI领域取得了巨大成功，但其是否能精确学习和实现算法仍不明确。本文旨在探索Transformer是否能够精确实现k-means聚类这一基础且广泛使用的算法。

Method: 论文首先从理论上证明存在一种称为k-means transformer的架构，能够利用现代Transformer的标准组件（如注意力机制和残差连接）精确实现Lloyd算法。随后通过数值实验验证了这一架构与Lloyd算法的精确对应关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，k-means transformer能够精确实现Lloyd算法。此外，通过对架构的可解释性调整（如引入层归一化或多层感知机），还能生成多种新的聚类算法变体，如软k-means、球形k-means等。

Conclusion: 研究证明了Transformer机制能够精确映射到算法过程，为在Transformer中实现精确算法提供了清晰且可解释的视角。

Abstract: The invention of the transformer architecture has revolutionized Artificial
Intelligence (AI), yielding unprecedented success in areas such as natural
language processing, computer vision, and multimodal reasoning. Despite these
advances, it is unclear whether transformers are able to learn and implement
precise algorithms. Here, we demonstrate that transformers can exactly
implement a fundamental and widely used algorithm for $k$-means clustering:
Lloyd's algorithm. First, we theoretically prove the existence of such a
transformer architecture, which we term the $k$-means transformer, that exactly
implements Lloyd's algorithm for $k$-means clustering using the standard
ingredients of modern transformers: attention and residual connections. Next,
we numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the
exact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing
a fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate
that interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or
multilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants
of clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed
$k$-means, and more. Collectively, our findings demonstrate how transformer
mechanisms can precisely map onto algorithmic procedures, offering a clear and
interpretable perspective on implementing precise algorithms in transformers.

Method: 引入黎曼生成解码器，通过黎曼优化器找到流形上的最大似然潜在变量，并训练解码器网络，摒弃了编码器。

Result: 在合成扩散过程、线粒体DNA推断的人类迁移和细胞分裂周期三个案例中，学习到的表示均符合预设几何结构并捕捉了内在非欧几里得结构。

Conclusion: 该方法仅需解码器，兼容现有架构，生成的潜在空间可解释且与数据几何对齐，显著简化了流形约束。

Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on approximating
densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing difficult objectives,
potentially harming models. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce
the Riemannian generative decoder which finds manifold-valued maximum
likelihood latents with a Riemannian optimizer while training a decoder
network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint
compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds.
We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching
diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells
undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations
respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure.
Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures,
and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: Retrofitting large language models (LLMs) with new behaviors typically
requires full finetuning or distillation-costly steps that must be repeated for
every architecture. In this work, we introduce Command-V, a
backpropagation-free behavior transfer method that copies an existing residual
activation adapter from a donor model and pastes its effect into a recipient
model. Command-V profiles layer activations on a small prompt set, derives
linear converters between corresponding layers, and applies the donor
intervention in the recipient's activation space. This process does not require
access to the original training data and needs minimal compute. In three case
studies-safety-refusal enhancement, jailbreak facilitation, and automatic
chain-of-thought reasoning--Command-V matches or exceeds the performance of
direct finetuning while using orders of magnitude less compute. Our code and
data are accessible at https://github.com/GithuBarry/Command-V/.

Result: 发现思想锚点（如规划或回溯句子）对推理过程有不成比例的影响，不同方法结果一致。

Conclusion: 句子级分析可深入理解模型推理，跨方法一致性验证了思想锚点的重要性。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many fields. However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning
creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all
previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that
analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to
understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution
methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual
importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the
model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box
method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which
identified ``broadcasting'' sentences that receive disproportionate attention
from all future sentences via ``receiver'' attention heads; (3) a causal
attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by
suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each
future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of
thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that
disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought
anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an
open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our
methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods
that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning. The consistency across
methods demonstrates the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper
understanding of reasoning models.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，针对特定领域（如医学）的微调需求激增。联邦学习（FL）提供了一种去中心化且保护隐私的协作方式，但在处理大模型时面临性能和效率挑战。

Method: 提出GradualDiff-Fed框架，通过传输模型权重的差异而非整个模型，显著降低通信成本，提高可扩展性和效率。

Conclusion: GradualDiff-Fed是一种高效的解决方案，可在保护隐私的前提下，利用分布式数据微调大模型，且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an
unprecedented demand for fine-tuning models for specialized domains, such as
medical science. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized and
privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without sharing
raw data, it presents significant challenges, particularly in performance and
managing large model sizes efficiently. In this paper, we introduce
GradualDiff-Fed, an FL framework designed explicitly for LLMs, and their
challenge of handling the high parameter size. GradualDiff-Fed reduces
communication costs by transmitting only the difference of model weights rather
than the entire model during training rounds. Such an approach significantly
improves scalability and communication efficiency, making it more feasible to
fine-tune LLMs across distributed clients without compromising performance. Our
evaluation demonstrates that GradualDiff-Fed achieves performance on par with
centralized training while drastically reducing communication overhead. These
results highlight the potential of GradualDiff-Fed as an efficient solution for
fine-tuning large models from distributed data in privacy-preserving settings
without comprising performance.

Conclusion: 通过自然语言蒸馏工具知识的方法能有效提升LLMs的数学推理能力，同时避免推理时依赖外部工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical problems that
require exact computation or multi-step algebraic reasoning. Tool-integrated
reasoning (TIR) offers a promising solution by leveraging external tools such
as code interpreters to ensure correctness, but it introduces inference-time
dependencies that hinder scalability and deployment. In this work, we propose a
new paradigm for distilling tool knowledge into LLMs purely through natural
language. We first construct a Solver Agent that solves math problems by
interleaving planning, symbolic tool calls, and reflective reasoning. Then,
using a back-translation pipeline powered by multiple LLM-based agents, we
convert interleaved TIR traces into natural language reasoning traces. A
Translator Agent generates explanations for individual tool calls, while a
Rephrase Agent merges them into a fluent and globally coherent narrative.
Empirically, we show that fine-tuning a small open-source model on these
synthesized traces enables it to internalize both tool knowledge and structured
reasoning patterns, yielding gains on competition-level math benchmarks without
requiring tool access at inference.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在用户级差分隐私（DP）下的模型个性化问题，提出了一种高效的联邦学习算法，用于在异构数据中恢复共享嵌入和局部低维表示，并在更广泛的用户分布下提供隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习中，用户数据通常具有统计异质性，且最优参数共享一个未知的低维嵌入。如何在保护用户隐私的同时，高效地学习这一共享嵌入和局部表示是一个重要问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于FedRep算法的私有联邦学习算法，利用Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换降低共享嵌入和用户数据的有效维度，并在差分隐私约束下进行优化。

Result: 算法在更广泛的用户分布（次高斯分布）下提供了隐私保护，并在自然参数范围内将隐私误差项提高了O~(dk)倍。在二分类设置中，通过边缘损失实现了与维度无关的风险边界。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，在边缘损失下，即使在高维空间中，也能实现与维度无关的风险边界，为隐私保护的联邦学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study model personalization under user-level differential privacy (DP) in
the shared representation framework. In this problem, there are $n$ users whose
data is statistically heterogeneous, and their optimal parameters share an
unknown embedding $U^* \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times k}$ that maps the user parameters
in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to low-dimensional representations in $\mathbb{R}^k$, where
$k\ll d$. Our goal is to privately recover the shared embedding and the local
low-dimensional representations with small excess risk in the federated
setting. We propose a private, efficient federated learning algorithm to learn
the shared embedding based on the FedRep algorithm in [CHM+21]. Unlike
[CHM+21], our algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and our results hold
for the case of noisy labels. In contrast to prior work on private model
personalization [JRS+21], our utility guarantees hold under a larger class of
users' distributions (sub-Gaussian instead of Gaussian distributions).
Additionally, in natural parameter regimes, we improve the privacy error term
in [JRS+21] by a factor of $\widetilde{O}(dk)$. Next, we consider the binary
classification setting. We present an information-theoretic construction to
privately learn the shared embedding and derive a margin-based accuracy
guarantee that is independent of $d$. Our method utilizes the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform to reduce the effective dimensions of the
shared embedding and the users' data. This result shows that
dimension-independent risk bounds are possible in this setting under a margin
loss.

Abstract: We investigate the high-precision training of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) in unbounded domains, with a special focus on applications to
singularity formulation in PDEs. We propose a modularized approach and study
the choices of neural network ansatz, sampling strategy, and optimization
algorithm. When combined with rigorous computer-assisted proofs and PDE
analysis, the numerical solutions identified by PINNs, provided they are of
high precision, can serve as a powerful tool for studying singularities in
PDEs. For 1D Burgers equation, our framework can lead to a solution with very
high precision, and for the 2D Boussinesq equation, which is directly related
to the singularity formulation in 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, we
obtain a solution whose loss is $4$ digits smaller than that obtained in
\cite{wang2023asymptotic} with fewer training steps. We also discuss potential
directions for pushing towards machine precision for higher-dimensional
problems.

definite kernels defined on Riemannian symmetric spaces, thus providing
theoretical justification for their use in applications involving

Abstract: This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection
in distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated
contrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional
centralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and
anomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed
collaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature
discrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding
representations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample
pairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.
Without exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a
federated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to
represent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system
logs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both
contrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect
fine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical
attack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario
to examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It
demonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing
complex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key
modules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method
achieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It
offers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in
distributed systems.

Conclusion: 通过合理调整推理时参数，可以避免过度依赖代理奖励信号，从而提升模型的实际性能和对齐目标。

Abstract: A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is
optimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM
outputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a
user or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never
perfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as
correctness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified
reward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance
-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we
characterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when
and how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this
phenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we
introduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact
approximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We
show that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where
the true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of
a broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter
this effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence
in high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce
HedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter
and avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging
mitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with
minimal computational overhead.

Result: 在Gymnasium多个环境中实证验证了该方法能有效提升策略的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 全局Lipschitz正则化是增强行为克隆策略鲁棒性的有效手段，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has
even been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.
BC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset
composed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any
additional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the
policy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.
Since the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the
agent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz
regularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy
network. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a
robustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm
perturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network
that ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across
various environments in Gymnasium. Keywords: Robust Reinforcement Learning;

Conclusion: CMO和NNR有效解决了图数据中的类别不平衡和结构噪声问题，为图分布外分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classification often suffers from sharp
performance drops, particularly under category imbalance and structural noise.
This work tackles two pressing challenges in this context: (1) the
underperformance of minority classes due to skewed label distributions, and (2)
their heightened sensitivity to structural noise in graph data. To address
these problems, we propose two complementary solutions. First, Constrained Mean
Optimization (CMO) improves minority class robustness by encouraging
similarity-based instance aggregation under worst-case conditions. Second, the
Neighbor-Aware Noise Reweighting (NNR) mechanism assigns dynamic weights to
training samples based on local structural consistency, mitigating noise
influence. We provide theoretical justification for our methods, and validate
their effectiveness with extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing significant improvements in Graph OOD generalization and
classification accuracy. The code for our method is available at:

TL;DR: BADGNN提出了一种批处理无关的动态图神经网络框架，通过时间Lipschitz正则化和自适应注意力调整，解决了大批次训练导致的时间信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态图中，保持时间连续性至关重要。然而，基于记忆的动态图神经网络（MDGNNs）在大批次训练时往往会破坏事件序列，导致时间信息丢失，进而影响时间建模和参数收敛。

Method: BADGNN框架包含两个核心组件：1) 时间Lipschitz正则化（TLR）用于控制参数搜索空间的扩展；2) 自适应注意力调整（A3）用于缓解正则化和批处理引起的注意力失真。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，BADGNN在保持强大性能的同时，能够支持更大的批次大小和更快的训练速度，优于TGN。

Conclusion: BADGNN通过创新的正则化和注意力调整机制，有效解决了动态图神经网络在大批次训练中的时间连续性问题，提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: In dynamic graphs, preserving temporal continuity is critical. However,
Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) trained with large batches
often disrupt event sequences, leading to temporal information loss. This
discontinuity not only deteriorates temporal modeling but also hinders
optimization by increasing the difficulty of parameter convergence. Our
theoretical study quantifies this through a Lipschitz upper bound, showing that
large batch sizes enlarge the parameter search space. In response, we propose
BADGNN, a novel batch-agnostic framework consisting of two core components: (1)
Temporal Lipschitz Regularization (TLR) to control parameter search space
expansion, and (2) Adaptive Attention Adjustment (A3) to alleviate attention
distortion induced by both regularization and batching. Empirical results on
three benchmark datasets show that BADGNN maintains strong performance while
enabling significantly larger batch sizes and faster training compared to TGN.

Motivation: 随着可再生能源的高渗透率和基于逆变器资源的广泛应用，电力系统运行条件更加多变，现有EOCS方法计算速度无法满足在线整定计算的需求。

Conclusion: PGNN方法在准确性和计算速度上均有显著提升，适用于在线继电器整定计算。

Abstract: The Extreme Operating Conditions Search (EOCS) problem is one of the key
problems in relay setting calculation, which is used to ensure that the setting
values of protection relays can adapt to the changing operating conditions of
power systems over a period of time after deployment. The high penetration of
renewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the
operating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the
adoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the
computation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,
heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency
requirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,
this paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS
method suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system
information is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a
topological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph
distance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model
for feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each
node are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to
predict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed
PGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,
where some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation
units. The nonlinear fault characteristics of renewables are fully considered
when computing fault currents. The experiment results show that the proposed
PGNN method achieves higher accuracy than the existing methods in solving the
EOCS problem. Meanwhile, it also provides greater improvements in online
computation time.

Abstract: Deep state-space models (SSMs) have gained increasing popularity in sequence
modelling. While there are numerous theoretical investigations of shallow SSMs,
how the depth of the SSM affects its expressiveness remains a crucial problem.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the role of depth and width in
deep linear SSMs, aiming to characterize how they influence the expressive
capacity of the architecture. First, we rigorously prove that in the absence of
parameter constraints, increasing depth and increasing width are generally
equivalent, provided that the parameter count remains within the same order of
magnitude. However, under the assumption that the parameter norms are
constrained, the effects of depth and width differ significantly. We show that
a shallow linear SSM with large parameter norms can be represented by a deep
linear SSM with smaller norms using a constructive method. In particular, this
demonstrates that deep SSMs are more capable of representing targets with large
norms than shallow SSMs under norm constraints. Finally, we derive upper bounds
on the minimal depth required for a deep linear SSM to represent a given
shallow linear SSM under constrained parameter norms. We also validate our
theoretical results with numerical experiments

Abstract: The application of Deep Learning-based Schemes (DLSs) for detecting False
Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) in smart grids has attracted significant
attention. This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted
FDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current
Differential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,
utilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by
introducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to
misclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the
LCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,
including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long
short-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial
conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models
perform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial
attacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To
address this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense
mechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial
FDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy. Our results highlight the
significant threat posed by adversarial attacks to DLS-based FDIA detection,
underscore the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures in smart grids, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing model
robustness against adversarial FDIAs.

Conclusion: CroMoTEX在胸片辅助训练下，仅需心电图输入即可实现高效心脏病理诊断，适合实际临床部署。

Abstract: Modern diagnostic workflows are increasingly multimodal, integrating diverse
data sources such as medical images, structured records, and physiological time
series. Among these, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest X-rays (CXRs) are two
of the most widely used modalities for cardiac assessment. While CXRs provide
rich diagnostic information, ECGs are more accessible and can support scalable
early warning systems. In this work, we propose CroMoTEX, a novel contrastive
learning-based framework that leverages chest X-rays during training to learn
clinically informative ECG representations for multiple cardiac-related
pathologies: cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, and edema. Our method aligns ECG
and CXR representations using a novel supervised cross-modal contrastive
objective with adaptive hard negative weighting, enabling robust and
task-relevant feature learning. At test time, CroMoTEX relies solely on ECG
input, allowing scalable deployment in real-world settings where CXRs may be
unavailable. Evaluated on the large-scale MIMIC-IV-ECG and MIMIC-CXR datasets,
CroMoTEX outperforms baselines across all three pathologies, achieving up to
78.31 AUROC on edema. Our code is available at

Abstract: Road traffic crashes are a significant global cause of fatalities,
emphasizing the urgent need for accurate crash data to enhance prevention
strategies and inform policy development. This study addresses the challenge of
alcohol inference mismatch (AIM) by employing database narrative alignment to
identify AIM in crash data. A framework was developed to improve data quality
in crash management systems and reduce the percentage of AIM crashes. Utilizing
the BERT model, the analysis of 371,062 crash records from Iowa (2016-2022)
revealed 2,767 AIM incidents, resulting in an overall AIM percentage of 24.03%.
Statistical tools, including the Probit Logit model, were used to explore the
crash characteristics affecting AIM patterns. The findings indicate that
alcohol-related fatal crashes and nighttime incidents have a lower percentage
of the mismatch, while crashes involving unknown vehicle types and older
drivers are more susceptible to mismatch. The geospatial cluster as part of
this study can identify the regions which have an increased need for education
and training. These insights highlight the necessity for targeted training
programs and data management teams to improve the accuracy of crash reporting

learning. Existing works typically rely on node contextual information to
recover the masked information. However, they fail to generalize well to
heterophilic graphs where connected nodes may be not similar, because they
focus only on capturing the neighborhood information and ignoring the
discrepancy information between different nodes, resulting in indistinguishable
node representations. In this paper, to address this issue, we propose a
Discrepancy-Aware Graph Mask Auto-Encoder (DGMAE). It obtains more
distinguishable node representations by reconstructing the discrepancy
information of neighboring nodes during the masking process. We conduct
extensive experiments on 17 widely-used benchmark datasets. The results show
that our DGMAE can effectively preserve the discrepancies of nodes in
low-dimensional space. Moreover, DGMAE significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art graph self-supervised learning methods on three graph analytic
including tasks node classification, node clustering, and graph classification,
demonstrating its remarkable superiority. The code of DGMAE is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Transformer模型在上下文学习（ICL）中如何根据任务复杂度选择最简解释，并通过实验和理论验证了其类似奥卡姆剃刀的归纳偏好。

Method: 设计了基于马尔可夫链和线性回归的受控实验，通过贝叶斯框架理论分析，并验证了模型规模、训练分布、上下文长度和架构的影响。

Result: Transformer能准确识别任务复杂度并推断参数，且倾向于选择最简解释。实验表明预训练的GPT-4模型也表现出类似奥卡姆剃刀的偏好。

Conclusion: Transformer在多样任务分布训练后，会自然形成平衡模型拟合与复杂度的贝叶斯奥卡姆剃刀机制，这种归纳偏好可能是其固有特性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables transformers to adapt to new tasks through
contextual examples without parameter updates. While existing research has
typically studied ICL in fixed-complexity environments, practical language
models encounter tasks spanning diverse complexity levels. This paper
investigates how transformers navigate hierarchical task structures where
higher-complexity categories can perfectly represent any pattern generated by
simpler ones. We design well-controlled testbeds based on Markov chains and
linear regression that reveal transformers not only identify the appropriate
complexity level for each task but also accurately infer the corresponding
parameters--even when the in-context examples are compatible with multiple
complexity hypotheses. Notably, when presented with data generated by simpler
processes, transformers consistently favor the least complex sufficient
explanation. We theoretically explain this behavior through a Bayesian
framework, demonstrating that transformers effectively implement an in-context
Bayesian Occam's razor by balancing model fit against complexity penalties. We
further ablate on the roles of model size, training mixture distribution,
inference context length, and architecture. Finally, we validate this Occam's
razor-like inductive bias on a pretrained GPT-4 model with Boolean-function
tasks as case study, suggesting it may be inherent to transformers trained on
diverse task distributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进四叉树搜索（PQS）的新方法，用于高效设计电磁结构，显著降低评估成本并缩短设计周期。


<details>

Motivation: 电磁结构设计面临高维设计空间和昂贵评估的挑战，现有方法通常需要大量且难以适应实际规模和预算限制。

Method: PQS将传统图像式布局转换为基于四叉树的分层表示，实现从全局模式到局部细节的渐进搜索，并引入一致性驱动的样本选择机制以减少对高精度预测器的依赖。

Result: 在两个实际工程任务中，PQS在有限计算预算下实现了满意设计，评估成本比生成方法降低75-85%，节省20.27-38.80天的设计周期。

Conclusion: PQS方法有效解决了电磁结构设计中的高成本和效率问题，为实际工程应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing
advanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to
high-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing
methods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate
evaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale
and budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called
Progressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the
high-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a
quadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from
global patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly
accurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection
mechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing
exploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS
on two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective
Surface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can
achieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming
baseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts
evaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product
designing cycle.

TL;DR: 论文提出μTransfer-FNO，一种零样本超参数迁移技术，通过在小规模FNO上优化的配置直接应用于大规模FNO，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fourier神经算子（FNO）在处理复杂偏微分方程时需要增加傅里叶模式数量，导致参数激增和超参数调优计算成本过高。

Method: 基于最大更新参数化（μP）框架，推导出一种参数化方案，实现不同傅里叶模式数FNO间的超参数迁移。

Result: 实验表明，μTransfer-FNO在减少大规模FNO调优成本的同时，保持或提升了模型精度。

Conclusion: μTransfer-FNO为大规模FNO提供了一种高效、可扩展的超参数迁移解决方案。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) offer a principled approach for solving
complex partial differential equations (PDEs). However, scaling them to handle
more complex PDEs requires increasing the number of Fourier modes, which
significantly expands the number of model parameters and makes hyperparameter
tuning computationally impractical. To address this, we introduce
$\mu$Transfer-FNO, a zero-shot hyperparameter transfer technique that enables
optimal configurations, tuned on smaller FNOs, to be directly applied to
billion-parameter FNOs without additional tuning. Building on the Maximal
Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) framework, we mathematically derive a
parametrization scheme that facilitates the transfer of optimal hyperparameters
across models with different numbers of Fourier modes in FNOs, which is
validated through extensive experiments on various PDEs. Our empirical study
shows that Transfer-FNO reduces computational cost for tuning hyperparameters
on large FNOs while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Motivation: 稀疏奖励下的多智能体强化学习存在探索不足和协作关注不够的问题，需要新方法提升合作效率。

Method: FIM框架包含三个核心：识别关键状态维度、设计反事实内在奖励、基于资格迹的信用积累机制。

Result: 实验表明FIM在多种基准测试中显著优于基线方法，提升了稀疏奖励下的协作性能。

Conclusion: FIM通过定向影响关键状态维度，有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的多智能体协作难题。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under sparse rewards
presents a fundamental challenge due to limited exploration and insufficient
coordinated attention among agents. In this work, we propose the Focusing
Influence Mechanism (FIM), a novel framework that enhances cooperation by
directing agent influence toward task-critical elements, referred to as Center
of Gravity (CoG) state dimensions, inspired by Clausewitz's military theory.
FIM consists of three core components: (1) identifying CoG state dimensions
based on their stability under agent behavior, (2) designing counterfactual
intrinsic rewards to promote meaningful influence on these dimensions, and (3)
encouraging persistent and synchronized focus through eligibility-trace-based
credit accumulation. These mechanisms enable agents to induce more targeted and
effective state transitions, facilitating robust cooperation even in extremely
sparse reward settings. Empirical evaluations across diverse MARL benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed FIM significantly improves cooperative
performance compared to baselines.

Motivation: 现有基于单一变量类型的因果发现方法缺乏鲁棒性，难以处理复杂场景。

Method: 先应用现有方法定向部分边，再通过标签关系推导未定向边的方向。

Result: 实验表明该方法优于纯类型方法，且标签关系符合常识。

Conclusion: 多标签方法提高了因果发现的灵活性和准确性。

Abstract: Not every causal relation between variables is equal, and this can be
leveraged for the task of causal discovery. Recent research shows that pairs of
variables with particular type assignments induce a preference on the causal
direction of other pairs of variables with the same type. Although useful, this
assignment of a specific type to a variable can be tricky in practice. We
propose a tag-based causal discovery approach where multiple tags are assigned
to each variable in a causal graph. Existing causal discovery approaches are
first applied to direct some edges, which are then used to determine edge
relations between tags. Then, these edge relations are used to direct the
undirected edges. Doing so improves upon purely type-based relations, where the
assumption of type consistency lacks robustness and flexibility due to being
restricted to single types for each variable. Our experimental evaluations show
that this boosts causal discovery and that these high-level tag relations fit
common knowledge.

Abstract: Bias problems in the estimation of $Q$-values are a well-known obstacle that
slows down convergence of $Q$-learning and actor-critic methods. One of the
reasons of the success of modern RL algorithms is partially a direct or
indirect overestimation reduction mechanism. We propose an easy to implement
method built on top of distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms
to deal with the overestimation in a locally adaptive way. Our framework is
simple to implement, existing distributional algorithms can be improved with a
few lines of code. We provide theoretical evidence and use double $Q$-learning
to show how to include locally adaptive overestimation control in existing
algorithms. Experiments are provided for tabular, Atari, and MuJoCo
environments.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse scientific applications. However, existing approaches face
critical efficiency challenges when scaling to large geometric graphs and
suffer significant performance degradation when the input graphs are sparsified
for computational tractability. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastEGNN and DistEGNN, two novel enhancements to equivariant GNNs for
large-scale geometric graphs. FastEGNN employs a key innovation: a small
ordered set of virtual nodes that effectively approximates the large unordered
graph of real nodes. Specifically, we implement distinct message passing and
aggregation mechanisms for different virtual nodes to ensure mutual
distinctiveness, and minimize Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual
and real coordinates to achieve global distributedness. This design enables
FastEGNN to maintain high accuracy while efficiently processing large-scale
sparse graphs. For extremely large-scale geometric graphs, we present DistEGNN,
a distributed extension where virtual nodes act as global bridges between
subgraphs in different devices, maintaining consistency while dramatically
reducing memory and computational overhead. We comprehensively evaluate our
models across four challenging domains: N-body systems (100 nodes), protein
dynamics (800 nodes), Water-3D (8,000 nodes), and our new Fluid113K benchmark
(113,000 nodes). Results demonstrate superior efficiency and performance,
establishing new capabilities in large-scale equivariant graph learning. Code

Motivation: 当前机器遗忘技术的漏洞研究不足，可能导致隐私泄露。现有攻击方法需要访问包含隐私数据的原始模型，违背了MU的隐私保护目标。

Method: 采用师生知识蒸馏架构，将未遗忘模型作为噪声标注器，将知识传递给学生模型，并将其转化为带噪声标签学习（LNL）问题以推断被遗忘实例的正确标签。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，MRA策略在恢复被遗忘实例的类别成员关系方面表现出高效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来研究机器遗忘漏洞建立了基准，揭示了现有MU技术的潜在隐私风险。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) technology facilitates the removal of the influence
of specific data instances from trained models on request. Despite rapid
advancements in MU technology, its vulnerabilities are still underexplored,
posing potential risks of privacy breaches through leaks of ostensibly
unlearned information. Current limited research on MU attacks requires access
to original models containing privacy data, which violates the critical
privacy-preserving objective of MU. To address this gap, we initiate an
innovative study on recalling the forgotten class memberships from unlearned
models (ULMs) without requiring access to the original one. Specifically, we
implement a Membership Recall Attack (MRA) framework with a teacher-student
knowledge distillation architecture, where ULMs serve as noisy labelers to
transfer knowledge to student models. Then, it is translated into a Learning
with Noisy Labels (LNL) problem for inferring the correct labels of the
forgetting instances. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MU methods with
multiple real datasets demonstrate that the proposed MRA strategy exhibits high
efficacy in recovering class memberships of unlearned instances. As a result,
our study and evaluation have established a benchmark for future research on MU
vulnerabilities.

Method: 提出COLUR框架，采用协同训练架构先遗忘标签噪声的影响，再通过置信度细化进行模型再学习。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，COLUR在模型修复后始终优于其他SOTA方法。

Conclusion: COLUR框架能有效修复噪声标签导致的模型退化，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large deep learning models have achieved significant success in various
tasks. However, the performance of a model can significantly degrade if it is
needed to train on datasets with noisy labels with misleading or ambiguous
information. To date, there are limited investigations on how to restore
performance when model degradation has been incurred by noisy label data.
Inspired by the ``forgetting mechanism'' in neuroscience, which enables
accelerating the relearning of correct knowledge by unlearning the wrong
knowledge, we propose a robust model restoration and refinement (MRR) framework
COLUR, namely Confidence-Oriented Learning, Unlearning and Relearning.
Specifically, we implement COLUR with an efficient co-training architecture to
unlearn the influence of label noise, and then refine model confidence on each
label for relearning. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real datasets
and all evaluation results show that COLUR consistently outperforms other SOTA
methods after MRR.

Result: 该方法能可靠识别有效变量组合，显著提升了多种先进符号回归算法的性能。

Conclusion: 通过迭代降维和变量组合替换，该方法为符号回归问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，显著提升了算法的恢复能力。

Abstract: Solutions of symbolic regression problems are expressions that are composed
of input variables and operators from a finite set of function symbols. One
measure for evaluating symbolic regression algorithms is their ability to
recover formulae, up to symbolic equivalence, from finite samples. Not
unexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more
complex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.
Variables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed
combinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one
new variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.
However, finding valid substitutions is challenging. Here, we address this
challenge by searching over the expression space of small substitutions and
testing for validity. The validity test is reduced to a test of functional
dependence. The resulting iterative dimension reduction procedure can be used
with any symbolic regression approach. We show that it reliably identifies
valid substitutions and significantly boosts the performance of different types
of state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超参数优化（HPO）通常通过最小化验证误差来选择最优配置，但验证误差的随机性和依赖采样策略可能导致过调优（类似模型训练中的过拟合）。这一现象在HPO和AutoML领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 论文首先形式化定义了过调优，并与元过拟合等概念区分；随后对HPO基准数据进行了大规模重新分析，评估过调优的普遍性和严重性，并分析了性能指标、采样策略等因素的影响。

Result: 研究表明，过调优现象比预期更常见（约10%案例中会导致泛化误差劣于默认配置），通常较轻微但偶尔严重。数据集规模、学习算法和HPO方法等因素均会影响过调优。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁重视过调优问题（尤其在小数据场景中），并指出需进一步研究缓解策略。结果表明当前HPO方法可能因过度优化验证误差而损害泛化性能。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter
configuration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen
data. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is
estimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This
approach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to
improved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are
inherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question
arises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting
at the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk
minimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term
overtuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical
relevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML
literature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it
from related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale
reanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of
overtuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously
assumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,
overtuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse
generalization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further
analyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset
size, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss
mitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of
overtuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further
mitigation strategies should be studied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常微分方程（ODEs）的求解对理解动力系统行为至关重要，但非线性系统的自动化求解仍具挑战性。传统计算机代数系统（CASs）通过Lie点对称性简化方程，但寻找这些对称性本身是一个难题。

Abstract: Solving systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is essential when
it comes to understanding the behavior of dynamical systems. Yet, automated
solving remains challenging, in particular for nonlinear systems. Computer
algebra systems (CASs) provide support for solving ODEs by first simplifying
them, in particular through the use of Lie point symmetries. Finding these
symmetries is, however, itself a difficult problem for CASs. Recent works in
symbolic regression have shown promising results for recovering symbolic
expressions from data. Here, we adapt search-based symbolic regression to the
task of finding generators of Lie point symmetries. With this approach, we can
find symmetries of ODEs that existing CASs cannot find.

Motivation: 现有基于前瞻性学习的空间构建方法在适应新类时存在原型偏差和结构固定性问题，限制了嵌入空间的表达能力。论文旨在通过优化特征-结构双重一致性来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出一致性驱动的校准与匹配框架（ConCM），包括基于海马体联想记忆的记忆感知原型校准和动态结构匹配，以增强特征的概念中心一致性和跨会话结构一致性。

Result: 在mini-ImageNet和CUB200等大规模FSCIL基准测试中，ConCM的性能优于当前最优方法，增量会话的调和准确率分别提高了3.20%和3.68%。

Conclusion: ConCM框架通过特征-结构双重一致性优化，有效解决了小样本类增量学习中的知识冲突问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) requires models to adapt to novel
classes with limited supervision while preserving learned knowledge. Existing
prospective learning-based space construction methods reserve space to
accommodate novel classes. However, prototype deviation and structure fixity
limit the expressiveness of the embedding space. In contrast to fixed space
reservation, we explore the optimization of feature-structure dual consistency
and propose a Consistency-driven Calibration and Matching Framework (ConCM)
that systematically mitigate the knowledge conflict inherent in FSCIL.
Specifically, inspired by hippocampal associative memory, we design a
memory-aware prototype calibration that extracts generalized semantic
attributes from base classes and reintegrates them into novel classes to
enhance the conceptual center consistency of features. Further, we propose
dynamic structure matching, which adaptively aligns the calibrated features to
a session-specific optimal manifold space, ensuring cross-session structure
consistency. Theoretical analysis shows that our method satisfies both
geometric optimality and maximum matching, thereby overcoming the need for
class-number priors. On large-scale FSCIL benchmarks including mini-ImageNet
and CUB200, ConCM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current
optimal method by 3.20% and 3.68% in harmonic accuracy of incremental sessions.

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，FAF显著优于基线方法，尤其在CO₂排放数据集上比iTransformer提升41.81%。

Conclusion: FAF通过结合通用与特定特征，实现了少样本下的鲁棒预测，为时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-task and few-shot time series forecasting tasks are commonly
encountered in scenarios such as the launch of new products in different
cities. However, traditional time series forecasting methods suffer from
insufficient historical data, which stems from a disregard for the generalized
and specific features among different tasks. For the aforementioned challenges,
we propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which
consists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the
Task-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,
the GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to
extract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is
trained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,
each of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing
phase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the
TSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the
generalized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This
design enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with
sparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world
datasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three
categories of time series forecasting methods. In particular, FAF achieves a
41.81\% improvement over the best baseline, iTransformer, on the CO$_2$
emissions dataset.

Abstract: Stellarators are magnetic confinement devices under active development to
deliver steady-state carbon-free fusion energy. Their design involves a
high-dimensional, constrained optimization problem that requires expensive
physics simulations and significant domain expertise. Recent advances in plasma
physics and open-source tools have made stellarator optimization more
accessible. However, broader community progress is currently bottlenecked by
the lack of standardized optimization problems with strong baselines and
datasets that enable data-driven approaches, particularly for quasi-isodynamic
(QI) stellarator configurations, considered as a promising path to commercial
fusion due to their inherent resilience to current-driven disruptions. Here, we
release an open dataset of diverse QI-like stellarator plasma boundary shapes,
paired with their ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria and performance
metrics. We generated this dataset by sampling a variety of QI fields and
optimizing corresponding stellarator plasma boundaries. We introduce three
optimization benchmarks of increasing complexity: (1) a single-objective
geometric optimization problem, (2) a "simple-to-build" QI stellarator, and (3)
a multi-objective ideal-MHD stable QI stellarator that investigates trade-offs
between compactness and coil simplicity. For every benchmark, we provide
reference code, evaluation scripts, and strong baselines based on classical
optimization techniques. Finally, we show how learned models trained on our
dataset can efficiently generate novel, feasible configurations without
querying expensive physics oracles. By openly releasing the dataset along with
benchmark problems and baselines, we aim to lower the entry barrier for
optimization and machine learning researchers to engage in stellarator design
and to accelerate cross-disciplinary progress toward bringing fusion energy to
the grid.

Result: 大型模型在全似然方法下性能显著提升，更多特征可改善预测，有助于疾病预测和治疗靶点识别。

Conclusion: DeepWAS通过解决计算瓶颈，实现了更高效的遗传变异表型预测，为精准医学提供新工具。

Abstract: To understand how genetic variants in human genomes manifest in phenotypes --
traits like height or diseases like asthma -- geneticists have sequenced and
measured hundreds of thousands of individuals. Geneticists use this data to
build models that predict how a genetic variant impacts phenotype given genomic
features of the variant, like DNA accessibility or the presence of nearby
DNA-bound proteins. As more data and features become available, one might
expect predictive models to improve. Unfortunately, training these models is
bottlenecked by the need to solve expensive linear algebra problems because
variants in the genome are correlated with nearby variants, requiring inversion
of large matrices. Previous methods have therefore been restricted to fitting
small models, and fitting simplified summary statistics, rather than the full
likelihood of the statistical model. In this paper, we leverage modern fast
linear algebra techniques to develop DeepWAS (Deep genome Wide Association
Studies), a method to train large and flexible neural network predictive models
to optimize likelihood. Notably, we find that larger models only improve
performance when using our full likelihood approach; when trained by fitting
traditional summary statistics, larger models perform no better than small
ones. We find larger models trained on more features make better predictions,
potentially improving disease predictions and therapeutic target
identification.

Abstract: Dynamical systems play a key role in modeling, forecasting, and
decision-making across a wide range of scientific domains. However, variations
in system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to
drastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for
constructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we
introduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks
(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from
the parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the
inferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The
learned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base
network, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a
target network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution
conditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of
models rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across
parameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the
dynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The
performance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical
systems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and
extrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were
unseen during training. In all cases, our approach outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art baselines in both short-term forecast accuracy and in
capturing long-term dynamical features, such as attractor statistics.

Conclusion: 系统搜索小型符号表达式空间是一种有效的符号回归方法，优于当前最先进的技术。

Abstract: In a regression task, a function is learned from labeled data to predict the
labels at new data points. The goal is to achieve small prediction errors. In
symbolic regression, the goal is more ambitious, namely, to learn an
interpretable function that makes small prediction errors. This additional goal
largely rules out the standard approach used in regression, that is, reducing
the learning problem to learning parameters of an expansion of basis functions
by optimization. Instead, symbolic regression methods search for a good
solution in a space of symbolic expressions. To cope with the typically vast
search space, most symbolic regression methods make implicit, or sometimes even
explicit, assumptions about its structure. Here, we argue that the only obvious
structure of the search space is that it contains small expressions, that is,
expressions that can be decomposed into a few subexpressions. We show that
systematically searching spaces of small expressions finds solutions that are
more accurate and more robust against noise than those obtained by
state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods. In particular, systematic search
outperforms state-of-the-art symbolic regressors in terms of its ability to
recover the true underlying symbolic expressions on established benchmark data
sets.

Conclusion: 通过校准模型，可以显著提升基于扰动的解释质量。

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the
transparency of modern machine-learning models. However, their reliability is
often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific
perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between
uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual
accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models frequently
produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to
explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this
directly undermines explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX,
a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved perturbation-based
explanations while preserving their original predictions. Experiments on
popular computer vision models demonstrate that our calibration strategy
produces explanations that are more aligned with human perception and actual
object locations.

Abstract: Coherently forecasting the behaviour of a target variable across both coarse

several business applications, and remains an open research problem in temporal
hierarchical forecasting. Here, we propose a new hierarchical architecture that
tackles this problem by leveraging modules that specialize in forecasting the
different temporal aggregation levels of interest. The architecture, which
learns to encode the average behaviour of the target variable within its hidden
layers, makes accurate and coherent forecasts across the target temporal
hierarchies. We validate our architecture on the challenging, real-world M5
dataset and show that it outperforms established methods, such as the TSMixer
model.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) recently gains growing interests from RL
researchers. However, the performance of offline RL suffers from the
out-of-distribution problem, which can be corrected by feedback in online RL.
Previous offline RL research focuses on restricting the offline algorithm in
in-distribution even in-sample action sampling. In contrast, fewer work pays
attention to the influence of the batch data. In this paper, we first build a
bridge over the batch data and the performance of offline RL algorithms
theoretically, from the perspective of model-based offline RL optimization. We
draw a conclusion that, with mild assumptions, the distance between the
state-action pair distribution generated by the behavioural policy and the
distribution generated by the optimal policy, accounts for the performance gap
between the policy learned by model-based offline RL and the optimal policy.
Secondly, we reveal that in task-agnostic settings, a series of policies
trained by unsupervised RL can minimize the worst-case regret in the
performance gap. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions, UDG (Unsupervised
Data Generation) is devised to generate data and select proper data for offline
training under tasks-agnostic settings. Empirical results demonstrate that UDG
can outperform supervised data generation on solving unknown tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)方法，通过三种创新技术预防大语言模型中的异常值，显著提升4位量化性能，训练开销仅增加2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型(LLM)中的极端激活异常值严重降低量化性能，阻碍设备端高效部署。现有方法多为事后缓解，实际效果有限。

Method: OSP包含三大创新：(1) Muon优化器消除特权基；(2) 单尺度RMSNorm防止通道放大；(3) 可学习嵌入投影重分布激活值。

Result: 在1万亿token上训练的1.4B参数模型，4位量化下10个基准平均得分35.7(Adam模型26.5)，峰度接近零(0.04 vs 标准模型1818.56)。

Conclusion: 异常值并非LLM固有特性，而是训练策略导致。OSP从根本上改变了LLM量化行为，为高效部署开辟新途径。

Abstract: Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically
degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.
While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized
causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe
Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier
formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key
innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while
maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing
channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,
redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We
validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is
the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive
4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10
benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%
training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis
(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally
altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not
inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way
for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints

Conclusion: CAAT-Net有效降低了通信开销，同时加速了训练和推理过程。

Abstract: Training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
tensor-parallelism requires substantial communication to synchronize
activations. Our findings suggest that with a few minor adjustments to current
practices, LLMs can be trained without fully synchronizing activations,
reducing bandwidth demands. We name this "Communication-Aware Architecture for
Tensor-parallelism" (CAAT-Net). We train 1B and 7B parameter CAAT-Net models,
with a 50% reduction in tensor-parallel communication and no significant drop
in pretraining accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how CAAT-Net accelerates
both training and inference workloads.

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决捷径学习问题，且实验发现标注质量比数量更重要。

Abstract: Controlling the patterns a model learns is essential to preventing reliance
on irrelevant or misleading features. Such reliance on irrelevant features,
often called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including
medical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to
real-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided
by humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.
These annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of
feature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.
Unfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are
unreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize. In this work, we
propose a simplified objective that simultaneously optimizes for explanation
robustness and mitigation of shortcut learning. Unlike prior objectives with
similar aims, we demonstrate theoretically why our approach ought to be more
effective. Across a comprehensive series of experiments, we show that our
approach consistently reduces test-time misclassifications by 20% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. We also extend prior experimental settings to include
natural language processing tasks. Additionally, we conduct novel ablations
that yield practical insights, including the relative importance of annotation
quality over quantity. Code for our method and experiments is available at:

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了共形预测的实用性，为机器学习应用中的不确定性量化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial for the trustworthiness of
machine learning applications. Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) offers a
distribution-free framework for generating prediction sets or intervals with
user-specified confidence. However, standard ICP guarantees are marginal and
typically require a fresh calibration set for each new prediction to maintain
their validity. This paper addresses this practical limitation by demonstrating
how e-conformal prediction, in conjunction with Hoeffding's inequality, can
enable the repeated use of a single calibration set with a high probability of
preserving the desired coverage. Through a case study on the CIFAR-10 dataset,
we train a deep neural network and utilise a calibration set to estimate a
Hoeffding correction. This correction allows us to apply a modified Markov's
inequality, leading to the construction of prediction sets with quantifiable
confidence. Our results illustrate the feasibility of maintaining provable
performance in conformal prediction while enhancing its practicality by
reducing the need for repeated calibration. The code for this work is publicly
available.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同数据集和网络架构下显著提高了平均准确率，同时极大减少了内存占用。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小化基于内存的持续学习算法内存占用方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting can be trivially alleviated by keeping all data from
previous tasks in memory. Therefore, minimizing the memory footprint while
maximizing the amount of relevant information is crucial to the challenge of
continual learning. This paper aims to decrease required memory for
memory-based continuous learning algorithms. We explore the options of
extracting a minimal amount of information, while maximally alleviating
forgetting. We propose the usage of lightweight generators based on Singular
Value Decomposition to enhance existing continual learning methods, such as
A-GEM and Experience Replay. These generators need a minimal amount of memory
while being maximally effective. They require no training time, just a single
linear-time fitting step, and can capture a distribution effectively from a
small number of data samples. Depending on the dataset and network
architecture, our results show a significant increase in average accuracy
compared to the original methods. Our method shows great potential in
minimizing the memory footprint of memory-based continual learning algorithms.

Motivation: 数据隐私问题日益突出，现有同态加密技术多局限于加密推理，深度神经网络的加密训练因计算复杂而受限。

Conclusion: ReBoot实现了高效的全加密DNN训练，为机器学习即服务提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning
methods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising
confidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end
data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely
been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training
has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party
computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial
computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training
under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully
encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,
ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on
local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and
reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that
leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering
both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate
bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of
arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine
learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and
tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point
plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test
accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%
over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up
to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌级推测解码（SD）在长链推理中速度提升有限，因为长令牌猜测的正确率随长度指数下降。本文旨在突破这一算法天花板。

Method: 提出Lookahead Reasoning方法，利用轻量级草案模型预测多个未来步骤，目标模型批量扩展这些步骤，验证器保留语义正确的步骤，并让目标模型重新生成失败的步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME等基准测试中，Lookahead Reasoning将SD的速度提升从1.4倍提高到2.1倍，且速度提升随GPU吞吐量增加而更好扩展。

Conclusion: Lookahead Reasoning通过步骤级并行性有效提升了推理模型的解码速度，突破了令牌级SD的限制，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the
resulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)
helps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire
$\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\gamma$ grows. This
means allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic
ceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this
ceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of
parallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,
and each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.
In Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future
steps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a
verifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate
any that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图强化学习的异构图模型，用于优化关键基础设施网络（如电网）在灾害后的资源分配和修复顺序，显著提升了恢复效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键基础设施网络（如电网）在自然灾害等破坏后的恢复速度和功能恢复程度至关重要。传统资源分配和修复顺序规划问题复杂，需要高效且可推广的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了一种异构图模型，将运输网络和电网节点合并，结合图强化学习（GRL）和双图匹配技术，利用图神经网络和进化算法训练激励函数，优化修复任务的分配顺序。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在IEEE 8500节点电网和21平方公里运输网络中表现优异，恢复效率比随机策略高3倍，计算时间比基于优化的方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法在灾害恢复规划中具有通用性和可扩展性，能显著提升关键基础设施网络的恢复速度和功能恢复水平。

Abstract: The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions,
such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of
restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained.
Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning
problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network
nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation
that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation
nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable
efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with
bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for
assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the
environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning
techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive
functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling
weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation
environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train
the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution
test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the
case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,
depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and
scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better
performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based
solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power
restored.

TL;DR: OFTv2通过输入中心化重构和Cayley-Neumann参数化，显著提升了正交微调的效率和内存使用，同时支持量化模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正交微调（OFT）虽然参数效率高且能防止灾难性遗忘，但其计算和内存需求高，限制了实际应用。

Method: OFTv2采用输入中心化重构，使用矩阵-向量乘法（矩阵自由计算）降低计算成本，并引入Cayley-Neumann参数化高效近似正交参数化。

Result: OFTv2实现了高达10倍的训练速度提升和3倍的GPU内存使用降低，且在量化基础模型微调中表现优于QLoRA。

Conclusion: OFTv2在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率和内存使用，适用于量化模型微调，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation
while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory
demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational
bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly
matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we
propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector
multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational
cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an
efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in
Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow
OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage
without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support
finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular
QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

TL;DR: 论文提出频率解耦引导（FDG），通过分离高低频引导提升扩散模型生成质量，避免标准CFG的过饱和和多样性下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分类器无关引导（CFG）虽有效，但其工作机制不明确，且统一频率缩放导致高尺度过饱和、低尺度质量下降。

Method: 将CFG分解为低频（控制结构对齐）和高频（增强视觉保真）组件，并分别施加不同强度的引导。

Result: FDG在多个数据集和模型上显著提升样本保真度与多样性，FID和召回率优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: FDG作为即插即用方案，通过频率解耦优化了生成质量，成为CFG的有效替代。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become an essential component of modern
conditional diffusion models. Although highly effective in practice, the
underlying mechanisms by which CFG enhances quality, detail, and prompt
alignment are not fully understood. We present a novel perspective on CFG by
analyzing its effects in the frequency domain, showing that low and high
frequencies have distinct impacts on generation quality. Specifically,
low-frequency guidance governs global structure and condition alignment, while
high-frequency guidance mainly enhances visual fidelity. However, applying a
uniform scale across all frequencies -- as is done in standard CFG -- leads to
oversaturation and reduced diversity at high scales and degraded visual quality
at low scales. Based on these insights, we propose frequency-decoupled guidance
(FDG), an effective approach that decomposes CFG into low- and high-frequency
components and applies separate guidance strengths to each component. FDG
improves image quality at low guidance scales and avoids the drawbacks of high
CFG scales by design. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets
and models, we demonstrate that FDG consistently enhances sample fidelity while
preserving diversity, leading to improved FID and recall compared to CFG,
establishing our method as a plug-and-play alternative to standard
classifier-free guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的变分推断方法通常采用各向同性高斯近似，无法匹配神经网络固有的几何结构，导致不确定性估计不准确。

Method: CAP框架利用von Mises-Fisher分布建模权重不确定性，通过解析推导将vMF浓度参数与激活噪声方差关联，并引入新的KL散度正则化器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上的实验表明，CAP将预期校准误差降低了5.6倍，同时提供了可解释的逐层不确定性分析。

Conclusion: CAP为深度学习中的不确定性量化提供了一个理论严谨且实用的方法，计算开销小且易于集成到标准架构中。

Abstract: Deep neural networks require principled uncertainty quantification, yet
existing variational inference methods often employ isotropic Gaussian
approximations in weight space that poorly match the network's inherent
geometry. We address this mismatch by introducing Concentration-Adapted
Perturbations (CAP), a variational framework that models weight uncertainties
directly on the unit hypersphere using von Mises-Fisher distributions. Building
on recent work in radial-directional posterior decompositions and spherical
weight constraints, CAP provides the first complete theoretical framework
connecting directional statistics to practical noise regularization in neural
networks. Our key contribution is an analytical derivation linking vMF
concentration parameters to activation noise variance, enabling each layer to
learn its optimal uncertainty level through a novel closed-form KL divergence
regularizer. In experiments on CIFAR-10, CAP significantly improves model
calibration - reducing Expected Calibration Error by 5.6x - while providing
interpretable layer-wise uncertainty profiles. CAP requires minimal
computational overhead and integrates seamlessly into standard architectures,
offering a theoretically grounded yet practical approach to uncertainty
quantification in deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI方法（如SHAP）无法量化神经网络单元在数千个输出像素、标记或逻辑单元中的贡献，因此需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA)，一种模型无关的博弈论框架，通过系统地破坏单元组合来生成单元贡献图。

Result: MSA展示了正则化如何将计算集中在少数中心，揭示了LLM中的语言特定专家，并发现了GANs中的倒置像素生成层次结构。

Conclusion: MSA是一种强大的方法，可用于解释、编辑和压缩深度神经网络。

Abstract: Neural networks now generate text, images, and speech with billions of
parameters, producing a need to know how each neural unit contributes to these
high-dimensional outputs. Existing explainable-AI methods, such as SHAP,
attribute importance to inputs, but cannot quantify the contributions of neural
units across thousands of output pixels, tokens, or logits. Here we close that
gap with Multiperturbation Shapley-value Analysis (MSA), a model-agnostic
game-theoretic framework. By systematically lesioning combinations of units,
MSA yields Shapley Modes, unit-wise contribution maps that share the exact
dimensionality of the model's output. We apply MSA across scales, from
multi-layer perceptrons to the 56-billion-parameter Mixtral-8x7B and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN). The approach demonstrates how regularisation
concentrates computation in a few hubs, exposes language-specific experts
inside the LLM, and reveals an inverted pixel-generation hierarchy in GANs.
Together, these results showcase MSA as a powerful approach for interpreting,
editing, and compressing deep neural networks.

*Ben Keslaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种受物理系统振动分析启发的数据预处理技术，通过提取数据中最具信息量的特征来优化深度学习输入，显著减少输入维度并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在数据输入网络后的优化表现优异，但数据准备阶段存在瓶颈。传统方法在信号与噪声并存的环境中学习，而DRIFT旨在通过物理感知方式提取关键特征，提升数据表示的紧凑性和可解释性。

Method: DRIFT将图像投影到由板的振动模态形状形成的低维基上，生成基于物理的特征集。这种方法显著减少了输入维度（如MNIST仅需约50个特征，CIFAR100少于100个），同时保持分类准确性。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR100上的实验表明，DRIFT在训练稳定性、抗过拟合和泛化鲁棒性上优于基于像素的模型和PCA。此外，DRIFT对批量大小、网络架构和图像分辨率的变化表现出极低的敏感性。

Conclusion: DRIFT通过物理驱动的数据转换，将深度学习的重点从架构工程转向输入优化，展示了其在提升性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the
data has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right
input: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential
patterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature
Transformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational
analysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes
of input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to
learn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by
emphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The
result is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances
training stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are
projected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes
of plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural
networks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on
MNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's
superiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training
stability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,
DRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network
architecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and
efficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from
architecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of
physics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出Noise Consistency Training (NCT)，一种轻量级方法，无需修改基础模型即可将新控制信号集成到预训练的一步生成器中，实现高效可控的内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前一步生成器在适应新控制条件（如结构约束、语义指导）时，通常需要昂贵的计算修改和扩散蒸馏。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入适配器模块和噪声一致性损失，在生成器的噪声空间中对齐不同条件依赖的生成行为，隐式引导模型遵循新控制。

Result: NCT在单次前向传播中实现最先进的可控生成，生成质量和计算效率均优于现有多步和基于蒸馏的方法。

Conclusion: NCT是一种模块化、数据高效且易于部署的方法，显著提升了一步生成器的可控性。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient and controllable high-quality content generation
remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence-generated content
(AIGC). While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation
techniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,
adapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,
semantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.
Conventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive
modifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This
paper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight
approach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step
generators without requiring access to original training images or retraining
the base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and
employs a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss
aligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are
conditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to
the new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as
minimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the
conditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,
data-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step
generator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,
surpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both
generation quality and computational efficiency. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线凸优化在ℓ_p-球上的表现，特别是在高维（d>T）和低维（d≤T）设置下的差异，探索FTRL算法是否可以通过固定正则化实现最优性。

Method: 使用Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL)算法，分析其在不同维度机制中的表现，并研究固定正则化是否足够。

Result: 发现对于可分离的正则化器，适应性是必要的，任何固定正则化器在某一维度机制中都会表现不佳。此外，在高维情况下，线性赌博机问题无法获得次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: FTRL算法需要适应性正则化才能在所有维度机制中保持最优，固定正则化无法同时适应高维情况。

Abstract: We study online convex optimization on $\ell_p$-balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for
$p > 2$. While always sub-linear, the optimal regret exhibits a shift between
the high-dimensional setting ($d > T$), when the dimension $d$ is greater than
the time horizon $T$ and the low-dimensional setting ($d \leq T$). We show that
Follow-the-Regularised-Leader (FTRL) with time-varying regularisation which is
adaptive to the dimension regime is anytime optimal for all dimension regimes.
Motivated by this, we ask whether it is possible to obtain anytime optimality
of FTRL with fixed non-adaptive regularisation. Our main result establishes
that for separable regularisers, adaptivity in the regulariser is necessary,
and that any fixed regulariser will be sub-optimal in one of the two dimension
regimes. Finally, we provide lower bounds which rule out sub-linear regret
bounds for the linear bandit problem in sufficiently high-dimension for all
$\ell_p$-balls with $p \geq 1$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型正则化需要大量手动调参来平衡复杂度和过拟合问题，这既耗时又低效。

Method: 采用交叉正则化方法，通过验证梯度动态调整正则化参数，将参数优化分为训练数据指导特征学习和验证数据控制复杂度两部分。

Result: 该方法在神经网络中表现出高噪声容忍性，并能自动生成架构特异性正则化，同时与数据增强、不确定性校准等任务无缝集成。

Conclusion: 交叉正则化不仅简化了正则化参数的调整过程，还提供了高效的单次训练方案，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Abstract: Model regularization requires extensive manual tuning to balance complexity
against overfitting. Cross-regularization resolves this tradeoff by directly
adapting regularization parameters through validation gradients during
training. The method splits parameter optimization - training data guides
feature learning while validation data shapes complexity controls - converging
provably to cross-validation optima. When implemented through noise injection
in neural networks, this approach reveals striking patterns: unexpectedly high
noise tolerance and architecture-specific regularization that emerges
organically during training. Beyond complexity control, the framework
integrates seamlessly with data augmentation, uncertainty calibration and
growing datasets while maintaining single-run efficiency through a simple
gradient-based approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如RLHF）计算成本高且不稳定，而DPO虽轻量但仅支持单一静态偏好分布，难以适应多目标或动态场景。

Method: 通过可控单纯形加权公式整合多维度人类偏好（如帮助性、无害性），支持列表式偏好反馈和动态插值。

Result: 在静态目标上与DPO效果相当，同时具备更强的通用性和适应性，适用于实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言模型对齐提供了更灵活高效的解决方案，尤其适合多目标动态需求场景。

Abstract: While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) capture broad world
knowledge and reasoning capabilities, steering their behavior toward desired
objectives remains challenging due to the lack of explicit supervision.
Existing alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), rely on training a reward model and performing reinforcement
learning to align with human preferences. However, RLHF is often
computationally intensive, unstable, and sensitive to hyperparameters.
  To address these limitations, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was
introduced as a lightweight and stable alternative, enabling direct alignment
of language models with pairwise preference data via classification loss.
However, DPO and its extensions generally assume a single static preference
distribution, limiting flexibility in multi-objective or dynamic alignment
settings.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted
Listwise DPO, which extends DPO to incorporate multiple human preference
dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, informativeness) and enables
dynamic interpolation through a controllable simplex-weighted formulation. Our
method supports both listwise preference feedback and flexible alignment across
varying user intents without re-training. Empirical and theoretical analysis
demonstrates that our method is as effective as traditional DPO on static
objectives while offering greater generality and adaptability for real-world
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs受限于计算资源，通常只能在有限点上优化，难以保证收敛性和准确性。

Method: 提出自适应权重方案，将孤立点的损失函数权重扩展到其连续邻域区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该权重方案能将相对L2误差降低到更小值。

Conclusion: 新权重方案有效提升了PINNs在求解PDE时的性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are extensively employed to solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) by ensuring that the outputs and
gradients of deep learning models adhere to the governing equations. However,
constrained by computational limitations, PINNs are typically optimized using a
finite set of points, which poses significant challenges in guaranteeing their
convergence and accuracy. In this study, we proposed a new weighting scheme
that will adaptively change the weights to the loss functions from isolated
points to their continuous neighborhood regions. The empirical results show
that our weighting scheme can reduce the relative $L^2$ errors to a lower
value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决多值动态系统、推荐算法和无损压缩等场景中，传统在线学习无法处理多值预测的问题。

Method: 通过定义'可预测错误'（即预测不被真实假设允许）并引入多值假设类，扩展了在线学习的框架。

Result: 证明了在该设定下，任何假设类的最优错误界限可分为Theta(1)、Theta(sqrt(N))或N三类（对数因子内）。

Conclusion: 模糊在线学习为多值预测问题提供了理论框架，并揭示了错误界限的三分特性。

Abstract: We propose a new variant of online learning that we call "ambiguous online
learning". In this setting, the learner is allowed to produce multiple
predicted labels. Such an "ambiguous prediction" is considered correct when at
least one of the labels is correct, and none of the labels are "predictably
wrong". The definition of "predictably wrong" comes from a hypothesis class in
which hypotheses are also multi-valued. Thus, a prediction is "predictably
wrong" if it's not allowed by the (unknown) true hypothesis. In particular,
this setting is natural in the context of multivalued dynamical systems,
recommendation algorithms and lossless compression. It is also strongly related
to so-called "apple tasting". We show that in this setting, there is a
trichotomy of mistake bounds: up to logarithmic factors, any hypothesis class
has an optimal mistake bound of either Theta(1), Theta(sqrt(N)) or N.

Conclusion: AI策展模型具备潜力接近人类审美判断，未来若有更多数据支持，其表现可进一步提升。

Abstract: Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,
who, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of
those to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call
art galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these
artworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or
constructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a
total of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset
of artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions
which have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar
curatorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data
available and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four
artificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these
various curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of
precision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key
insights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to
construct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions
with an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature
engineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can
make them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as
GPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use
the models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it
should be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be
closer and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art
curators.

Motivation: 探究语言模型从训练数据到更广泛部署分布中的行为泛化机制，特别是微调导致的'突发性失调'现象及其安全影响。

Method: 采用'模型差异'方法，通过稀疏自编码器比较微调前后模型的内部表示，识别激活空间中的'失调人格'特征。

Conclusion: 模型微调可能引发广泛的行为失调，但通过分析内部特征和针对性干预可有效缓解，为AI安全提供了新见解。

Abstract: Understanding how language models generalize behaviors from their training to
a broader deployment distribution is an important problem in AI safety. Betley
et al. discovered that fine-tuning GPT-4o on intentionally insecure code causes
"emergent misalignment," where models give stereotypically malicious responses
to unrelated prompts. We extend this work, demonstrating emergent misalignment
across diverse conditions, including reinforcement learning on reasoning
models, fine-tuning on various synthetic datasets, and in models without safety
training. To investigate the mechanisms behind this generalized misalignment,
we apply a "model diffing" approach using sparse autoencoders to compare
internal model representations before and after fine-tuning. This approach
reveals several "misaligned persona" features in activation space, including a
toxic persona feature which most strongly controls emergent misalignment and
can be used to predict whether a model will exhibit such behavior.
Additionally, we investigate mitigation strategies, discovering that
fine-tuning an emergently misaligned model on just a few hundred benign samples
efficiently restores alignment.

Abstract: Depression is a common mental illness across current human society.
Traditional depression assessment relying on inventories and interviews with
psychologists frequently suffer from subjective diagnosis results, slow and
expensive diagnosis process as well as lack of human resources. Since there is
a solid evidence that depression is reflected by various human internal brain
activities and external expressive behaviours, early traditional machine
learning (ML) and advanced deep learning (DL) models have been widely explored
for human behaviour-based automatic depression assessment (ADA) since 2012.
However, recent ADA surveys typically only focus on a limited number of human
behaviour modalities. Despite being used as a theoretical basis for developing
ADA approaches, existing ADA surveys lack a comprehensive review and summary of
multi-modal depression-related human behaviours. To bridge this gap, this paper
specifically summarises depression-related human behaviours across a range of
modalities (e.g. the human brain, verbal language and non-verbal
audio/facial/body behaviours). We focus on conducting an up-to-date and
comprehensive survey of ML-based ADA approaches for learning depression cues
from these behaviours as well as discussing and comparing their distinctive
features and limitations. In addition, we also review existing ADA competitions
and datasets, identify and discuss the main challenges and opportunities to
provide further research directions for future ADA researchers.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出改进版TTS评估指标TTSDS2，在多语言和领域测试中表现最佳，并发布相关资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS系统评估方法存在主观指标不可比、客观指标缺乏验证的问题，尤其对高质量合成语音效果不佳。

Method: 提出TTSDS2指标，构建含11,000+主观评分的多语言数据集，建立持续更新的测试流程。

Result: TTSDS2在16个指标中唯一实现所有领域Spearman相关系数>0.5，支持14种语言的基准测试。

Conclusion: TTSDS2显著提升评估鲁棒性，配套资源为近真实语音评估提供标准化方案。

Abstract: Evaluation of Text to Speech (TTS) systems is challenging and
resource-intensive. Subjective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) are not
easily comparable between works. Objective metrics are frequently used, but
rarely validated against subjective ones. Both kinds of metrics are challenged
by recent TTS systems capable of producing synthetic speech indistinguishable
from real speech. In this work, we introduce Text to Speech Distribution Score
2 (TTSDS2), a more robust and improved version of TTSDS. Across a range of
domains and languages, it is the only one out of 16 compared metrics to
correlate with a Spearman correlation above 0.50 for every domain and
subjective score evaluated. We also release a range of resources for evaluating
synthetic speech close to real speech: A dataset with over 11,000 subjective
opinion score ratings; a pipeline for continually recreating a multilingual
test dataset to avoid data leakage; and a continually updated benchmark for TTS
in 14 languages.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合α稳定模型与神经网络（Neural Steerer）的声源定位技术，通过物理信息神经网络插值麦克风阵列的导向向量，提升多声源场景下的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声源定位方法在处理非高斯信号和多声源场景时性能不足，需结合更鲁棒的信号模型与数据驱动的神经网络方法以提高定位准确性。

Method: 使用α稳定模型描述非高斯信号，并设计Neural Steerer神经网络插值导向向量，通过α稳定空间测度估计声源到达方向（DOA）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个声源场景下优于现有技术，尤其在非高斯信号条件下表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 结合α稳定模型与神经网络的声源定位技术显著提升了多声源和非高斯环境下的性能，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes a sound source localization (SSL) technique that
combines an $\alpha$-stable model for the observed signal with a neural
network-based approach for modeling steering vectors. Specifically, a
physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to
interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This
allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial
measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a
target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$
$\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to
leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer
in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed
technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound
sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频伪造检测数据集缺乏多样化的口音，尤其是南亚口音，导致模型在多样化语言和文化背景下检测效果不佳。

Method: 创建包含50名印度英语使用者的真实与伪造音频数据集IFD，并进行基线模型测试。

Result: IFD在检测性能上优于ASVspoof21（DF），且比ITW数据集更具挑战性。

Conclusion: IFD填补了南亚口音数据集的空白，为音频伪造检测提供了更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Advancements in audio deepfake technology offers benefits like AI assistants,
better accessibility for speech impairments, and enhanced entertainment.
However, it also poses significant risks to security, privacy, and trust in
digital communications. Detecting and mitigating these threats requires
comprehensive datasets. Existing datasets lack diverse ethnic accents, making
them inadequate for many real-world scenarios. Consequently, models trained on
these datasets struggle to detect audio deepfakes in diverse linguistic and
cultural contexts such as in South-Asian countries. Ironically, there is a
stark lack of South-Asian speaker samples in the existing datasets despite
constituting a quarter of the worlds population. This work introduces the
IndieFake Dataset (IFD), featuring 27.17 hours of bonafide and deepfake audio
from 50 English speaking Indian speakers. IFD offers balanced data distribution
and includes speaker-level characterization, absent in datasets like ASVspoof21
(DF). We evaluated various baselines on IFD against existing ASVspoof21 (DF)
and In-The-Wild (ITW) datasets. IFD outperforms ASVspoof21 (DF) and proves to
be more challenging compared to benchmark ITW dataset. The dataset will be
publicly available upon acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决城市环境中车辆碳排放监测的自动化与精确性问题，论文旨在开发一个结合车辆检测、分类和车牌识别的实时系统，以提供更准确的碳排放数据。

Method: 采用改进的YOLOv8架构进行车辆检测、分割与跟踪，结合专用的深度学习OCR模块处理车牌识别，并通过外部数据库验证车牌信息，实现多阶段的碳排放计算。

Result: YOLOv8检测器在边界框和分割掩码上的mAP@0.5分别达到71%和70%，OCR模块的字符识别准确率高达99%，验证了系统在智能交通中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将实时目标检测与深度OCR技术结合，为智能交通系统中的车辆碳排放监测提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: We present an enhanced YOLOv8 real time vehicle detection and classification
framework, for estimating carbon emissions in urban environments. The system
enhances YOLOv8 architecture to detect, segment, and track vehicles from live
traffic video streams. Once a vehicle is localized, a dedicated deep
learning-based identification module is employed to recognize license plates
and classify vehicle types. Since YOLOv8 lacks the built-in capacity for fine
grained recognition tasks such as reading license plates or determining vehicle
attributes beyond class labels, our framework incorporates a hybrid pipeline
where each detected vehicle is tracked and its bounding box is cropped and
passed to a deep Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module. This OCR system,
composed of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, is trained
specifically for character-level detection and license plate decoding under
varied conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and diverse font styles.
Additionally, the recognized plate information is validated using a real time
API that cross references with an external vehicle registration database to
ensure accurate classification and emission estimation. This multi-stage
approach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon
emissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset
enriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8
detector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for
bounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy
reached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model. These results affirm the
feasibility of combining real time object detection with deep OCR for practical
deployment in smart transportation systems, offering a scalable solution for
automated, vehicle specific carbon emission monitoring.

Motivation: 目前帕金森病的手指敲击测试依赖临床医生的主观评估，存在评分者间和评分者内的变异性，且无法捕捉个体运动特征的细节。

Method: 提出了一种基于视频的计算机视觉方法，提取四组临床相关特征（运动减少、运动迟缓、序列效应和犹豫停顿），并利用主成分分析和机器学习分类器预测MDS-UPDRS评分。

Result: 该方法在MDS-UPDRS评分预测上比现有方法更准确，并能提供可解释的个体运动特征量化，同时进一步区分了序列效应和犹豫停顿的细节。

Conclusion: 该框架为帕金森病运动特征的客观评估提供了实用解决方案，适用于临床和远程场景，未来需进一步验证其对症状治疗和疾病进展的响应性。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying motor characteristics in Parkinson disease (PD) is
crucial for monitoring disease progression and optimizing treatment strategies.
The finger-tapping test is a standard motor assessment. Clinicians visually
evaluate a patient's tapping performance and assign an overall severity score
based on tapping amplitude, speed, and irregularity. However, this subjective
evaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer
insights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This
paper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD
motor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant
features are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence
effect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and
clinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.
Principal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based
features corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis
has allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect
and hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to
train machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society
Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy
in MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable
quantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics. In summary,
the proposed framework provides a practical solution for the objective
assessment of PD motor characteristics, that can potentially be applied in both
clinical and remote settings. Future work is needed to assess its
responsiveness to symptomatic treatment and disease progression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的段式追踪方法，通过马尔可夫决策过程动态探索血管和道路等管状结构的最小路径，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有管状结构追踪方法（点式和段式）存在计算效率低、依赖先验形状的问题，需要一种更高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 将段式追踪建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），利用Q-Learning动态探索段结构图，按需计算边权重并自适应扩展搜索空间。

Result: 在典型管状结构数据集上，该方法显著优于当前最先进的点式和段式方法，能有效处理复杂拓扑并保持全局路径一致性。

Conclusion: 所提方法无需依赖大量先验知识，即可高效处理复杂管状结构追踪问题，具有鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: The computation of minimal paths for the applications in tracking tubular
structures such as blood vessels and roads is challenged by complex
morphologies and environmental variations. Existing approaches can be roughly
categorized into two research lines: the point-wise based models and the
segment-wise based models. Although segment-wise approaches have obtained
promising results in many scenarios, they often suffer from computational
inefficiency and heavily rely on a prescribed prior to fit the target elongated
shapes. We propose a novel framework that casts segment-wise tracking as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a reinforcement learning approach. Our
method leverages Q-Learning to dynamically explore a graph of segments,
computing edge weights on-demand and adaptively expanding the search space.
This strategy avoids the high cost of a pre-computed graph and proves robust to
incomplete initial information. Experimental reuslts on typical tubular
structure datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art point-wise and segment-wise approaches. The proposed method
effectively handles complex topologies and maintains global path coherence
without depending on extensive prior structural knowledge.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型使用多个预训练视觉专家时计算成本高，需一种高效方法整合多专家知识。

Method: 采用教师特定LoRA适配器和路由器，结合细粒度与粗粒度蒸馏，避免知识冲突并高效传递。

Result: 在多种视觉语言任务上，HAWAII表现优于主流开源视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: HAWAII有效整合多专家知识，显著提升模型性能且计算成本低。

Abstract: Improving the visual understanding ability of vision-language models (VLMs)
is crucial for enhancing their performance across various tasks. While using
multiple pretrained visual experts has shown great promise, it often incurs
significant computational costs during training and inference. To address this
challenge, we propose HAWAII, a novel framework that distills knowledge from
multiple visual experts into a single vision encoder, enabling it to inherit
the complementary strengths of several experts with minimal computational
overhead. To mitigate conflicts among different teachers and switch between
different teacher-specific knowledge, instead of using a fixed set of adapters
for multiple teachers, we propose to use teacher-specific Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) adapters with a corresponding router. Each adapter is aligned with a
specific teacher, avoiding noisy guidance during distillation. To enable
efficient knowledge distillation, we propose fine-grained and coarse-grained
distillation. At the fine-grained level, token importance scores are employed
to emphasize the most informative tokens from each teacher adaptively. At the
coarse-grained level, we summarize the knowledge from multiple teachers and
transfer it to the student using a set of general-knowledge LoRA adapters with
a router. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks demonstrate
the superiority of HAWAII, compared to the popular open-source VLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时空模型计算复杂度高且泛化能力有限，难以适应数据稀缺或新城市环境。Mamba的线性复杂度潜力未被充分利用，直接应用会导致性能下降。

Method: 设计Damba-ST模型：1) 域自适应状态空间模型分离共享与独立子空间；2) 三种域适配器桥接异构域分布。保留Mamba效率优势并增强跨域适应性。

Conclusion: Damba-ST以线性复杂度实现高效跨域时空预测，为城市服务部署提供可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Training urban spatio-temporal foundation models that generalize well across
diverse regions and cities is critical for deploying urban services in unseen
or data-scarce regions. Recent studies have typically focused on fusing
cross-domain spatio-temporal data to train unified Transformer-based models.
However, these models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high
memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment. Inspired
by the efficiency of Mamba, a state space model with linear time complexity, we
explore its potential for efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. However,
directly applying Mamba as a spatio-temporal backbone leads to negative
transfer and severe performance degradation. This is primarily due to
spatio-temporal heterogeneity and the recursive mechanism of Mamba's hidden
state updates, which limit cross-domain generalization. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Damba-ST, a novel domain-adaptive Mamba-based model for
efficient urban spatio-temporal prediction. Damba-ST retains Mamba's linear
complexity advantage while significantly enhancing its adaptability to
heterogeneous domains. Specifically, we introduce two core innovations: (1) a
domain-adaptive state space model that partitions the latent representation
space into a shared subspace for learning cross-domain commonalities and
independent, domain-specific subspaces for capturing intra-domain
discriminative features; (2) three distinct Domain Adapters, which serve as
domain-aware proxies to bridge disparate domain distributions and facilitate
the alignment of cross-domain commonalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the generalization and efficiency of Damba-ST. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on prediction tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, enabling seamless deployment in new urban environments without
extensive retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Mem4Nav通过分层地图和双记忆模块的协同作用，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in large-scale urban environments
requires embodied agents to ground linguistic instructions in complex scenes
and recall relevant experiences over extended time horizons. Prior modular
pipelines offer interpretability but lack unified memory, while end-to-end
(M)LLM agents excel at fusing vision and language yet remain constrained by
fixed context windows and implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce
\textbf{Mem4Nav}, a hierarchical spatial-cognition long-short memory system
that can augment any VLN backbone. Mem4Nav fuses a sparse octree for
fine-grained voxel indexing with a semantic topology graph for high-level
landmark connectivity, storing both in trainable memory tokens embedded via a
reversible Transformer. Long-term memory (LTM) compresses and retains
historical observations at both octree and graph nodes, while short-term memory
(STM) caches recent multimodal entries in relative coordinates for real-time
obstacle avoidance and local planning. At each step, STM retrieval sharply
prunes dynamic context, and, when deeper history is needed, LTM tokens are
decoded losslessly to reconstruct past embeddings. Evaluated on Touchdown and
Map2Seq across three backbones (modular, state-of-the-art VLN with prompt-based
LLM, and state-of-the-art VLN with strided-attention MLLM), Mem4Nav yields 7-13
pp gains in Task Completion, sufficient SPD reduction, and >10 pp nDTW
improvement. Ablations confirm the indispensability of both the hierarchical
map and dual memory modules. Our codes are open-sourced via

Conclusion: DiffRIS通过自适应框架显著提升遥感图像分割性能，为领域设立新标杆。

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) enables the precise
delineation of regions within remote sensing imagery through natural language
descriptions, serving critical applications in disaster response, urban
development, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent advances, current
approaches face significant challenges in processing aerial imagery due to
complex object characteristics including scale variations, diverse
orientations, and semantic ambiguities inherent to the overhead perspective. To
address these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses
the semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion
models for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework
introduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that
dynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and
object-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)
that iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise
segmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general
vision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD
enables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature
interaction. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets-RRSIS-D,
RefSegRS, and RISBench-demonstrate that DiffRIS consistently outperforms
existing methods across all standard metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for RRSIS tasks. The significant performance improvements
validate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for
remote sensing applications through our proposed adaptive framework.

Result: 在M3D-Cap数据集上超越基线模型，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效建模CT切片层次特征，验证了循环特征提取与注意力机制在CT报告生成中的优势。

Abstract: Generating reports for computed tomography (CT) images is a challenging task,
while similar to existing studies for medical image report generation, yet has
its unique characteristics, such as spatial encoding of multiple images,
alignment between image volume and texts, etc. Existing solutions typically use
general 2D or 3D image processing techniques to extract features from a CT
volume, where they firstly compress the volume and then divide the compressed
CT slices into patches for visual encoding. These approaches do not explicitly
account for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively
integrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific
organ lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG). In considering the
strong correlation among consecutive slices in CT scans, in this paper, we
propose a large language model (LLM) based CTRG method with recurrent visual
feature extraction and stereo attentions for hierarchical feature modeling.
Specifically, we use a vision Transformer to recurrently process each slice in
a CT volume, and employ a set of attentions over the encoded slices from
different perspectives to selectively obtain important visual information and
align them with textual features, so as to better instruct an LLM for CTRG.
Experiment results and further analysis on the benchmark M3D-Cap dataset show
that our method outperforms strong baseline models and achieves
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its validity and effectiveness.

Motivation: 理解大型视觉语言模型在生成自由形式文本响应时的视觉注意力分布，对于模型行为理解、幻觉诊断、偏见暴露和透明度保障至关重要。

Method: GLIMPSE融合了梯度加权注意力、自适应层传播和加权令牌聚合，生成整体响应级别的归因热图，用于解释跨模态推理。

Conclusion: GLIMPSE为分析大型视觉语言模型的跨模态推理提供了细粒度的可解释性工具，有助于诊断模型行为分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision language models (LVLMs) have unlocked
unprecedented capabilities in generating coherent responses from visual inputs.
However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention while
generating free-form textual responses remains a significant challenge, yet is
essential for understanding model behavior, diagnosing hallucination, exposing
bias and ensuring transparency. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance
Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight,
model-agnostic framework for visualizing the salient image regions that LVLMs
rely upon during open-ended visual question answering (VQA), while concurrently
revealing the multimodal textual saliency. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted
attention, adaptive layer propagation, and weighted token aggregation to
produce holistic response-level attribution heat maps for interpreting
cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior interpretability methods in
human-alignment. We demonstrate an analytic explainable AI (XAI) approach using
GLIMPSE to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution,
trace token-level reasoning dynamics, and analyze systematic human-attention

TL;DR: ScaleCap提出了一种可扩展的图像描述生成策略，通过启发式问答和对比句子评分解决LVLM的偏见问题，生成更准确、平衡和详细的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量图像描述生成面临两大挑战：多模态偏见导致描述粒度不平衡，语言偏见导致对不存在对象的幻觉描述。

Method: 提出可扩展的去偏见描述策略，包括启发式问答逐步注入相关信息，以及对比句子评分消除语言偏见导致的幻觉。

Result: 在11个基准测试中表现一致提升，生成的描述在丰富性和保真度上表现优异，适用于VQA和图像重建任务。

Conclusion: ScaleCap通过逐步增加推理成本生成更全面的图像描述，有效解决了现有方法的偏见问题，显著提升了描述质量。

Abstract: This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning
strategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key
challenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of
LVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,
offering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;
linguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.
To address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,
which continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference
budget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question
answering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates
content-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively
inject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level
offline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate
hallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more
heuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional
visual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and
informative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them
for LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely
used benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity
of generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions
in VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic
coverage. Code is available at https://github.com/Cooperx521/ScaleCap.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在情感计算中依赖的视觉线索，发现牙齿可见性等面部特征影响其性能，揭示了模型可能存在的偏见和捷径学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在了解视觉语言模型在情感识别中依赖的视觉线索是否基于心理学基础，还是表面学习，特别是在零样本设置下的表现。

Method: 通过在AffectNet数据集的牙齿标注子集上对不同规模的VLMs进行基准测试，并对表现最佳的GPT-4o进行结构化内省分析。

Result: 研究发现，牙齿可见性等面部特征（如眉毛位置）显著影响模型的情感推理，且模型在效价-唤醒预测中表现出高度内部一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了基础模型行为的涌现特性，但也指出了在敏感领域（如心理健康和教育）中可能存在的捷径学习、偏见和公平性问题。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming Affective Computing (AC),
with Vision Language Models (VLMs) now capable of recognising emotions in zero
shot settings. This paper probes a critical but underexplored question: what
visual cues do these models rely on to infer affect, and are these cues
psychologically grounded or superficially learnt? We benchmark varying scale
VLMs on a teeth annotated subset of AffectNet dataset and find consistent
performance shifts depending on the presence of visible teeth. Through
structured introspection of, the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, we show
that facial attributes like eyebrow position drive much of its affective
reasoning, revealing a high degree of internal consistency in its
valence-arousal predictions. These patterns highlight the emergent nature of
FMs behaviour, but also reveal risks: shortcut learning, bias, and fairness
issues especially in sensitive domains like mental health and education.

TL;DR: RareSpot提出了一种结合多尺度一致性学习和上下文感知增强的检测框架，显著提升了无人机影像中小型稀有野生动物（如草原犬鼠）的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草原犬鼠等小型稀有野生动物因体型小、分布稀疏且视觉特征不明显，现有检测方法效果不佳，但其生态重要性极高，亟需更有效的自动检测技术以支持生态保护。

Method: 通过多尺度一致性学习优化特征金字塔的结构对齐以增强细粒度表征，并采用上下文感知增强策略合成困难样本进行训练，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在专家标注的无人机影像数据集上，检测准确率比基线方法提高35%以上，并在其他野生动物数据集上展现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: RareSpot为复杂空中场景中的小型稀有物种检测建立了新基准，兼具生态监测价值和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial
for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge.
Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone
species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size,
sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing
detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a
robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and
context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages
structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object
representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily,
context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training
instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental
contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an
expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared
to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional
wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark
and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish
a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了MedErr-CT基准，用于评估医学多模态大语言模型在CT报告中识别和纠正错误的能力，旨在提高临床诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查需求的增加，诊断错误问题日益突出。现有的医学视觉问答基准主要关注简单的视觉识别任务，缺乏临床相关性，无法评估专家级知识。

Method: 论文提出了MedErr-CT基准，包含六种错误类别（四种视觉中心错误和两种词汇错误），并分为分类、检测和纠正三个任务级别。

Result: 通过该基准评估了先进的3D医学多模态大语言模型，发现它们在不同错误类型上的能力存在显著差异。

Conclusion: MedErr-CT基准有助于开发更可靠且临床适用的多模态大语言模型，最终减少诊断错误并提高临床实践准确性。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis, but the
growing demand for CT examinations has raised concerns about diagnostic errors.
While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate promising
comprehension of medical knowledge, their tendency to produce inaccurate
information highlights the need for rigorous validation. However, existing
medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks primarily focus on simple
visual recognition tasks, lacking clinical relevance and failing to assess
expert-level knowledge. We introduce MedErr-CT, a novel benchmark for
evaluating medical MLLMs' ability to identify and correct errors in CT reports
through a VQA framework. The benchmark includes six error categories - four
vision-centric errors (Omission, Insertion, Direction, Size) and two lexical
error types (Unit, Typo) - and is organized into three task levels:
classification, detection, and correction. Using this benchmark, we
quantitatively assess the performance of state-of-the-art 3D medical MLLMs,
revealing substantial variation in their capabilities across different error
types. Our benchmark contributes to the development of more reliable and
clinically applicable MLLMs, ultimately helping reduce diagnostic errors and
improve accuracy in clinical practice. The code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临高内存和计算成本的问题，难以同时实现高性能和高效率。

Method: 采用分块预填充和双层键值解码方法，通过分块稀疏注意力减少计算开销，并根据任务相关性选择性加载键值。

Result: Video-XL-2在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到最优性能，单卡可处理超万帧视频，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: Video-XL-2通过创新稀疏化方法，实现了长视频理解的高效与高性能，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) models have made significant
progress in video understanding over the past few years. However, processing
long video inputs remains a major challenge due to high memory and
computational costs. This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both
strong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address
this challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior
cost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV
sparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based
pre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides
the visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each
chunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces
computational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding
selectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on
its relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and
enhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding
benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models. It also
demonstrates exceptional efficiency, capable of processing over 10,000 frames
on a single NVIDIA A100 (80GB) GPU and thousands of frames in just a few
seconds.

Abstract: While multi-vehicular collaborative driving demonstrates clear advantages
over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side
Units (RSUs). Drones offer unique advantages over ground-based perception:
complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized

Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的余弦相似度计算点云与文本嵌入，难以捕捉细粒度对齐关系，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出LM-AD方法，引入Affordance Query Module（AQM），利用预训练语言模型高效建模点云与文本的细粒度对齐。

Result: 在3D AffordanceNet数据集上，准确率和mIoU指标均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: LM-AD通过AQM模块有效解决了点云与文本细粒度对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of affordance detection in 3D point
clouds, a task that requires effectively capturing fine-grained alignments
between point clouds and text. Existing methods often struggle to model such
alignments, resulting in limited performance on standard benchmarks. A key
limitation of these approaches is their reliance on simple cosine similarity
between point cloud and text embeddings, which lacks the expressiveness needed
for fine-grained reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose LM-AD, a
novel method for affordance detection in 3D point clouds. Moreover, we
introduce the Affordance Query Module (AQM), which efficiently captures
fine-grained alignment between point clouds and text by leveraging a pretrained
language model. We demonstrated that our method outperformed existing
approaches in terms of accuracy and mean Intersection over Union on the 3D
AffordanceNet dataset.

Motivation: 超高分辨率遥感技术快速发展，现有语义分割方法在计算效率和多尺度特征融合方面面临挑战。

Method: 采用双流架构（GLCANet）结合自注意力机制和掩码交叉注意力机制，实现全局-局部特征自适应融合，降低GPU占用。

Result: 实验表明GLCANet在精度和计算效率上优于现有方法，能以小内存处理大尺寸高分辨率图像。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际遥感应用提供了高效解决方案，平衡了精度与资源消耗。

Abstract: With the rapid development of ultra-high resolution (UHR) remote sensing
technology, the demand for accurate and efficient semantic segmentation has
increased significantly. However, existing methods face challenges in
computational efficiency and multi-scale feature fusion. To address these
issues, we propose GLCANet (Global-Local Cross-Attention Network), a
lightweight segmentation framework designed for UHR remote sensing
imagery.GLCANet employs a dual-stream architecture to efficiently fuse global
semantics and local details while minimizing GPU usage. A self-attention
mechanism enhances long-range dependencies, refines global features, and
preserves local details for better semantic consistency. A masked
cross-attention mechanism also adaptively fuses global-local features,
selectively enhancing fine-grained details while exploiting global context to
improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show that GLCANet
outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding accuracy and computational
efficiency. The model effectively processes large, high-resolution images with
a small memory footprint, providing a promising solution for real-world remote
sensing applications.

Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中的深度学习模型需要大量真实图像数据集，但这些数据难以获取且存在隐私和法律问题。合成数据作为解决方案，但现有方法性能不足，因此需要改进。

Method: 论文提出两步法：1) 改进神经分形公式，生成新型合成数据；2) 提出反向风格化技术，将少量真实图像的特征迁移到合成数据上，提升其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低了合成数据与真实图像的分布差距（KID指标）。在EDM2扩散模型上预训练，FID降低11%，自编码器重建误差减少20%；ViT-S模型在ImageNet-100上的分类准确率提升10%以上。

Conclusion: 该工作为在缺乏大规模真实数据集时训练实用模型提供了新思路，展示了合成数据在实际任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models in computer vision require large datasets of real
images, which are difficult to curate and pose privacy and legal concerns,
limiting their commercial use. Recent works suggest synthetic data as an
alternative, yet models trained with it often underperform. This paper proposes
a two-step approach to bridge this gap. First, we propose an improved neural
fractal formulation through which we introduce a new class of synthetic data.
Second, we propose reverse stylization, a technique that transfers visual
features from a small, license-free set of real images onto synthetic datasets,
enhancing their effectiveness. We analyze the domain gap between our synthetic
datasets and real images using Kernel Inception Distance (KID) and show that
our method achieves a significantly lower distributional gap compared to
existing synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our experiments across different
tasks demonstrate the practical impact of this reduced gap. We show that
pretraining the EDM2 diffusion model on our synthetic dataset leads to an 11%
reduction in FID during image generation, compared to models trained on
existing synthetic datasets, and a 20% decrease in autoencoder reconstruction
error, indicating improved performance in data representation. Furthermore, a
ViT-S model trained for classification on this synthetic data achieves over a
10% improvement in ImageNet-100 accuracy. Our work opens up exciting
possibilities for training practical models when sufficiently large real
training sets are not available.

Conclusion: Surgery-R1通过创新的微调和奖励机制，显著提升了手术场景中的视觉问答定位能力，为临床应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of surgical
scene understanding, particularly in the task of Visual Question
Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA). However, existing
Surgical-VQLA models lack deep reasoning capabilities and interpretability in
surgical scenes, which limits their reliability and potential for development
in clinical applications. To address this issue, inspired by the development of
Reasoning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we first build the
Surgery-R1-54k dataset, including paired data for Visual-QA, Grounding-QA, and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Then, we propose the first Reasoning MLLM for
Surgical-VQLA (Surgery-R1). In our Surgery-R1, we design a two-stage
fine-tuning mechanism to enable the basic MLLM with complex reasoning abilities
by utilizing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT).
Furthermore, for an efficient and high-quality rule-based reward system in our
RFT, we design a Multimodal Coherence reward mechanism to mitigate positional
illusions that may arise in surgical scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate
that Surgery-R1 outperforms other existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in
the Surgical-VQLA task and widely-used MLLMs, while also validating its
reasoning capabilities and the effectiveness of our approach. The code and

Motivation: kVCT成像中的伪影会影响图像质量，进而影响临床决策。传统方法无法有效解决高分辨率kVCT与抗伪影MVCT之间的差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，结合特征重校准技术，专注于伪影区域和关键解剖结构，实现kVCT到MVCT的域转换。

Conclusion: 该方法使临床医生可以仅依赖kVCT，减少重复的高剂量MVCT扫描，降低癌症患者的辐射暴露。

Abstract: Artifacts in kilo-Voltage CT (kVCT) imaging degrade image quality, impacting
clinical decisions. We propose a deep learning framework for metal artifact
reduction (MAR) and domain transformation from kVCT to Mega-Voltage CT (MVCT).
The proposed framework, ReMAR-DS, utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with
enhanced feature recalibration, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving
anatomical structures. This ensures that only relevant information is utilized
in the reconstruction process. By infusing recalibrated features from the
encoder block, the model focuses on relevant spatial regions (e.g., areas with
artifacts) and highlights key features across channels (e.g., anatomical
structures), leading to improved reconstruction of artifact-corrupted regions.
Unlike traditional MAR methods, our approach bridges the gap between
high-resolution kVCT and artifact-resistant MVCT, enhancing radiotherapy
planning. It produces high-quality MVCT-like reconstructions, validated through
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Clinically, this enables oncologists
to rely on kVCT alone, reducing repeated high-dose MVCT scans and lowering
radiation exposure for cancer patients.

Conclusion: 在医学领域开发定制基础模型时，应避免方法创新偏见，现有计算机视觉方法已足够，无需过多调参或方法调整。

Abstract: With access to large-scale, unlabeled medical datasets, researchers are
confronted with two questions: Should they attempt to pretrain a custom
foundation model on this medical data, or use transfer-learning from an
existing generalist model? And, if a custom model is pretrained, are novel
methods required? In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a
case-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal
ultrasound dataset of 2M images. By selecting the well-established DINOv2
method for pretraining, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three fetal
ultrasound datasets, covering data from different countries, classification,
segmentation, and few-shot tasks. We compare against a series of models
pretrained on natural images, ultrasound images, and supervised baselines. Our
results demonstrate two key insights: (i) Pretraining on custom data is worth
it, even if smaller models are trained on less data, as scaling in natural
image pretraining does not translate to ultrasound performance. (ii) Well-tuned
methods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation
models for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and
little methodological adaptation. Given these findings, we argue that a bias
towards methodological innovation should be avoided when developing domain
specific foundation models under common computational resource constraints.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的状态空间模型（SSMs）在处理2D视觉数据时需要复杂修改，可能降低效率。本文旨在探索是否可以通过卷积和频域操作替代SSMs。

Method: MambaOutRS采用四阶段分层设计，结合门控CNN块进行局部特征提取，并引入傅里叶滤波门（FFG）模块在频域捕获全局信息。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上达到SOTA性能，MambaOutRS-t变体在UC Merced和AID上分别取得98.41%和95.99%的F1分数，参数量更少。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过门控卷积和频域操作的组合可以高效替代SSMs，为遥感等领域的高性能深度学习模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State
Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.
However, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex
modifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce
MambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image
classification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS
builds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and
introduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the
frequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our
architecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively
evaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,
NWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant
(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\% on UC Merced and
95.99\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including
larger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using
considerably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the
critical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to
capture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.
These results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be
effectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for
spatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,
MambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing
high-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision
domains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual
outputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability
gap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective
detection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric
hallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,
overlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We
develop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,
which enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning
capabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,
scenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed
more visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of
relation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our
knowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination
detection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to
efficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model
inference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to
mitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,
mPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results
indicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,
achieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our
code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的时间序列多光谱图像重建框架，结合SAR数据解决云覆盖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱影像(MSI)受云层影响导致信息缺失，而合成孔径雷达(SAR)虽不受云干扰但缺乏足够光谱细节，需结合两者优势实现精准作物测绘。

Method: 利用Vision Transformer的注意力机制，融合时间序列MSI和SAR的互补信息，重建云覆盖区域的MSI数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著优于仅使用非时间序列MSI/SAR或未结合SAR的时间序列MSI的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间序列ViT框架有效提升了云覆盖区域的多光谱图像重建质量。

Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for
early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral
information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by
cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient
spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel
framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT),
to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal
coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation
metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms
baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR,
effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.

Motivation: 后门攻击通过隐藏功能使深度学习模型在特定触发模式下表现异常，对高安全性应用中的人脸识别系统构成严重威胁。

Method: 开发新技术，用于检测人脸识别网络是否被植入自然物理触发器，并识别这些触发器。

Result: 在受攻击的人脸识别网络中，识别触发器的Top-5准确率达到74%，优于基线方法的56%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和识别自然触发的后门攻击，提升人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks embed a hidden functionality into deep neural networks,
causing the network to display anomalous behavior when activated by a
predetermined pattern in the input Trigger, while behaving well otherwise on
public test data. Recent works have shown that backdoored face recognition (FR)
systems can respond to natural-looking triggers like a particular pair of
sunglasses. Such attacks pose a serious threat to the applicability of FR
systems in high-security applications. We propose a novel technique to (1)
detect whether an FR network is compromised with a natural, physically
realizable trigger, and (2) identify such triggers given a compromised network.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with a compromised FR network,
where we are able to identify the trigger (e.g., green sunglasses or red hat)
with a top-5 accuracy of 74%, whereas a naive brute force baseline achieves 56%
accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting video content is essential for planning and
reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite advancements, unsupervised learning
of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present
VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition
and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to
recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and
interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a
combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules,
VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of
future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet
outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking
and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable
object and motion representations.

TL;DR: PEVLM提出了一种并行编码策略，显著提升了视觉语言模型在长视频理解中的预填充效率，无需微调模型，同时保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在长视频理解任务中受限于标准注意力机制的二次复杂度，影响了其应用范围。

Method: PEVLM通过将输入分块处理、保留全注意力位置嵌入并调整注意力权重以模拟全注意力分布，降低了计算复杂度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench基准测试中，PEVLM实现了8.37%的准确率提升，注意力计算速度提升7.47倍，端到端延迟降低40%。

Conclusion: PEVLM在低延迟、长上下文视频理解任务中表现出色，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
video-language tasks, yet their application to long video understanding remains
constrained by the quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{PEVLM}, a parallel encoding strategy
specifically designed to improve the prefill efficiency of VLMs without
requiring model finetuning. PEVLM partitions the input into block-wise segments
with a shared sink, preserves full-attention positional embeddings, and aligns
attention weights to mimic full-attention distributions. This design reduces
attention computation from $O((T \times N)^2)$ to $O(T \times N)$ while
maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
benchmark show that PEVLM achieves up to 8.37\% accuracy improvement over
existing inference-efficient methods and delivers up to 7.47x speedup in
attention computation and 40\% reduction in end-to-end latency. Under strict
latency constraints, PEVLM significantly outperforms baselines, raising
accuracy from 23.26\% to 61.03\%. These results highlight PEVLM's effectiveness
for low-latency, long-context video understanding, making it well-suited for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像因成像和采集参数的差异存在显著的视觉变异性，使得非专业用户难以理解。当前缺乏针对非专业用户的超声解释和扫描指导工具。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的一阶段方法生成超声图像场景图（SG），无需显式目标检测。通过LLM结合用户查询进一步优化SG表示，并利用SG指导扫描缺失的解剖结构。

Result: 在五名志愿者的左右颈部区域（包括颈动脉和甲状腺）图像上验证了方法的有效性，显示其能提升超声的解释性和可用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强超声的解释性和扫描指导，有望为非专业用户提供更标准化的解剖探索，推动超声技术的普及。

Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge
due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and
acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated
to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the
increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning
guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet
been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for
ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for
ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a
transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object
detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user
query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through
LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding
ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,
assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical
exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning
guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,
including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results
demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by
enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.

Abstract: We study NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network), a simple and efficient
deep learning baseline for image restoration. By using CIFAR10 images corrupted
with noise and blur, we conduct an ablation study of NAFNet's core components.
Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel
Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different
variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM)
and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance.
Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention
mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention,
while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with
recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future
work.

TL;DR: 论文提出Radial Attention，一种高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过模拟时空能量衰减现象降低视频扩散模型的计算成本，实现更长的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型因时间维度增加导致计算成本高昂，作者发现时空能量衰减现象，即注意力分数随时空距离增加而衰减，从而提出更高效的注意力机制。

Method: 提出Radial Attention，采用静态注意力掩码，使每个token仅关注空间邻近的token，且注意力窗口随时间距离缩小，复杂度为O(n log n)。

Result: 实验表明，Radial Attention在多个模型上保持视频生成质量，速度提升1.9倍，训练成本降低4.4倍，推理加速3.7倍，支持生成长达4倍的视频。

Conclusion: Radial Attention通过稀疏注意力机制显著提升视频扩散模型的效率和扩展性，为长视频生成提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video
generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases
computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively
expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal
Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish
as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical
decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we
propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \log
n)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute
density, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense
attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial
Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to
spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal
distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend
their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across
Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\times$ speedup
over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video
generation up to 4$\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to
4.4$\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to
3.7$\times$ compared to dense attention inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为Decomposable Flow Matching (DFM)的简单有效框架，用于渐进式生成视觉媒体，通过独立应用Flow Matching在多尺度表示的各层级上，提升了图像和视频的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维视觉模态生成计算密集，现有方法多采用渐进式生成，但扩散模型虽受益于从粗到细的去噪特性，却很少采用显式的多阶段架构，这些架构增加了复杂性。

Method: DFM框架在用户定义的多尺度表示（如拉普拉斯金字塔）的每个层级上独立应用Flow Matching，简化了架构并减少了对现有训练流程的修改。

Result: 在Imagenet-1k 512px上，DFM比基础架构提升了35.2%的FDD分数，比最佳基线提升了26.4%。应用于大型模型（如FLUX）微调时，DFM显示出更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: DFM以单一模型、架构简单性和对现有训练流程的最小修改，实现了视觉质量的显著提升和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Generating high-dimensional visual modalities is a computationally intensive
task. A common solution is progressive generation, where the outputs are
synthesized in a coarse-to-fine spectral autoregressive manner. While diffusion
models benefit from the coarse-to-fine nature of denoising, explicit
multi-stage architectures are rarely adopted. These architectures have
increased the complexity of the overall approach, introducing the need for a
custom diffusion formulation, decomposition-dependent stage transitions,
add-hoc samplers, or a model cascade. Our contribution, Decomposable Flow
Matching (DFM), is a simple and effective framework for the progressive
generation of visual media. DFM applies Flow Matching independently at each
level of a user-defined multi-scale representation (such as Laplacian pyramid).
As shown by our experiments, our approach improves visual quality for both
images and videos, featuring superior results compared to prior multistage
frameworks. On Imagenet-1k 512px, DFM achieves 35.2% improvements in FDD scores
over the base architecture and 26.4% over the best-performing baseline, under
the same training compute. When applied to finetuning of large models, such as
FLUX, DFM shows faster convergence speed to the training distribution.
Crucially, all these advantages are achieved with a single model, architectural
simplicity, and minimal modifications to existing training pipelines.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种基于标准化流的核方法，用于改进机器学习粗粒化分子动力学模拟中的力场校准，减少局部失真并保持全局构象准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习粗粒化力场校准依赖于力匹配方法，需要大量带有力标签的原子轨迹数据。然而，实际中这些力数据往往未被记录，导致传统方法无法应用于现有数据集。此外，现有的噪声核方法虽然能在低数据量情况下工作，但会引入显著的局部失真。

Result: 在小蛋白质上的实验表明，基于流的核方法能够仅从构型样本中生成高质量的粗粒化力场，显著减少局部失真。

Conclusion: 基于标准化流的核方法在机器学习粗粒化分子动力学模拟中表现出色，能够有效减少局部失真的同时保持全局构象准确性，为力场校准提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time
scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG
beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a
promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular
dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on
force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with
corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not
recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing
datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force
matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference
atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields
which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local
distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this
work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that
substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global
conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing
that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from
configurational samples.

Abstract: Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition,
enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

Abstract: E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously
achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain
efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in
precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the
computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this
paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking,
called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding
size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and
improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models.
We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and
ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive
loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and
implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller
embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.

Motivation: 现实中的推荐系统容易因用户行为数据中的敏感特征（如性别、年龄）导致推荐不公平。扩散模型因其建模不确定性和多样性的能力，适合用于解决这一问题。

Method: 提出FairGENRec模型，在训练阶段通过敏感特征识别模型注入随机噪声，并设计序列去噪模型进行反向重建；在推理阶段利用历史交互数据生成噪声并重构目标项表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，FairGENRec在推荐准确性和公平性上均有显著提升，并通过案例分析可视化公平性改进程度。

Conclusion: FairGENRec通过扩散模型有效建模推荐公平性，同时提升多样性和准确性，为推荐系统的公平性研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real
world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with
the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same
patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation
preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.
Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great
success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and
represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of
adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,
we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the
diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model
based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the
original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition
model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse
reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is
completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that
eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In
the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition
by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to
reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments
on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on
accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes
the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

Abstract: We develop ProxelGen, a protein structure generative model that operates on

Abstract: Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in
a molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the
drug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant
networks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D
molecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as
a viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve
generalization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models
require a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this
paper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively
addresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating
relative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million
parameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model
with 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative
positional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with
the shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different
attention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional
encoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to
serve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular
conformations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究比较了机器人场景理解中不同视觉语言模型（VLMs）在桌面场景描述上的表现，发现VLMs在常见物体识别上有效，但对新颖表示泛化能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估视觉语言模型在机器人场景理解中的应用，特别是在多视角下对桌面场景的自然语言描述能力。

Method: 方法包括使用配备RGB相机的机械臂采集多视角图像，并比较BLIP和VLMs等模型在单视角与多视角下的描述生成能力。

Result: 结果显示，VLMs在常见物体识别任务中表现良好，但在处理3D打印等新颖物体时泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 结论指出，VLMs适用于需要识别常见物体的机器人场景，但在面对新颖表示时需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Robotic scene understanding increasingly relies on vision-language models
(VLMs) to generate natural language descriptions of the environment. In this
work, we present a comparative study of captioning strategies for tabletop
scenes captured by a robotic arm equipped with an RGB camera. The robot
collects images of objects from multiple viewpoints, and we evaluate several
models that generate scene descriptions. We compare the performance of various
captioning models, like BLIP and VLMs. Our experiments examine the trade-offs
between single-view and multi-view captioning, and difference between
recognising real-world and 3D printed objects. We quantitatively evaluate
object identification accuracy, completeness, and naturalness of the generated
captions. Results show that VLMs can be used in robotic settings where common
objects need to be recognised, but fail to generalise to novel representations.
Our findings provide practical insights into deploying foundation models for
embodied agents in real-world settings.

TL;DR: CUPID是一种基于影响函数理论的机器人数据筛选方法，通过评估训练数据对策略性能的影响，优化模仿学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习中策略性能与演示数据质量密切相关，但理解单个演示对最终任务表现的影响仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出CUPID方法，利用影响函数理论评估训练数据对策略预期回报的影响，筛选有益数据并剔除有害数据。

Result: 实验表明，CUPID能有效提升策略性能，仅用33%的精选数据即可达到SOTA水平，并在硬件测试中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CUPID为机器人模仿学习提供了一种高效的数据筛选方法，显著提升了策略性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: In robot imitation learning, policy performance is tightly coupled with the
quality and composition of the demonstration data. Yet, developing a precise
understanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream
outcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent
challenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel
influence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given
a set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training
demonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and
selection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's
closed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out
training demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly
collected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated
and hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which
data drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of
curated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated
RoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware. Furthermore,
hardware experiments show that our method can identify robust strategies under
distribution shift, isolate spurious correlations, and even enhance the
post-training of generalist robot policies. Additional materials are made

TL;DR: AnchorDP3是一种用于双臂机器人操作的扩散策略框架，通过三项创新技术在高度随机化环境中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决双臂机器人在高度随机化环境中的操作问题，通过结合仿真监督语义分割、任务条件特征编码器和基于关键姿态的扩散策略，提升操作效率和准确性。

Method: 方法包括：1) 仿真监督语义分割，利用渲染的真实数据分割点云中的关键物体；2) 任务条件特征编码器，处理增强点云以实现多任务学习；3) 基于关键姿态的扩散策略，简化预测空间并提升几何一致性。

Result: 在RoboTwin基准测试中，AnchorDP3在极端随机化条件下实现了98.7%的平均成功率。

Conclusion: AnchorDP3框架结合仿真到现实的流程，有望实现仅通过场景和指令生成可部署的视觉运动策略，完全消除人类示范的需求。

Abstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic
manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized
environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1)
Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to
explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides
strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight
modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient
multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3)
Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing
dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action
anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to
affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is
forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses
simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence
and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation
data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark
across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table
height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the
RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous
generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction,
totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.

Abstract: As labor shortages and productivity stagnation increasingly challenge the
construction industry, automation has become essential for sustainable
infrastructure development. This paper presents an autonomous payload
transportation system as an initial step toward fully unmanned construction
sites. Our system, based on the CD110R-3 crawler carrier, integrates autonomous
navigation, fleet management, and GNSS-based localization to facilitate
material transport in construction site environments. While the current system
does not yet incorporate dynamic environment adaptation algorithms, we have
begun fundamental investigations into external-sensor based perception and
mapping system. Preliminary results highlight the potential challenges,
including navigation in evolving terrain, environmental perception under
construction-specific conditions, and sensor placement optimization for
improving autonomy and efficiency. Looking forward, we envision a construction
ecosystem where collaborative autonomous agents dynamically adapt to site
conditions, optimizing workflow and reducing human intervention. This paper
provides foundational insights into the future of robotics-driven construction
automation and identifies critical areas for further technological development.

*Dan Garber*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对稀疏最优解的凸优化问题的新方法，通过稀疏更新实现线性收敛，并显著降低运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然能利用最优解的稀疏性改进收敛速度，但无法降低每次迭代的高计算成本，尤其在高维问题中。

Method: 采用稀疏更新策略，依赖改进的条件数（混合范数条件数），实现线性收敛。

Result: 新方法不仅保持线性收敛，还显著减少运行时间，且更易实现。

Conclusion: 稀疏更新方法在理论和实践上均优于传统方法，适用于高维稀疏优化问题。

Abstract: In was recently established that for convex optimization problems with a
sparse optimal solution (may it be entry-wise sparsity or matrix rank-wise
sparsity) it is possible to have linear convergence rates which depend on an
improved mixed-norm condition number of the form $\frac{\beta_1{}s}{\alpha_2}$,
where $\beta_1$ is the $\ell_1$-Lipchitz continuity constant of the gradient,
$\alpha_2$ is the $\ell_2$-quadratic growth constant, and $s$ is the sparsity
of the optimal solution. However, beyond the improved convergence rate, these
methods are unable to leverage the sparsity of optimal solutions towards
improving also the runtime of each iteration, which may still be prohibitively
high for high-dimensional problems. In this work, we establish that linear
convergence rates which depend on this improved condition number can be
obtained using only sparse updates, which may result in overall significantly
improved running times. Moreover, our methods are considerably easier to
implement.

TL;DR: 论文提出BIRD-CRITIC基准和Six-Gym训练环境，结合SQL-Rewind和f-Plan Boosting方法，提升开源模型在SQL调试任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在文本到SQL任务中表现良好，但在SQL调试任务上缺乏严格评估。同时，开源模型在数据库任务中的能力提升对本地开发和数据隐私保护至关重要。

Method: 引入BIRD-CRITIC基准测试集，开发Six-Gym训练环境，采用SQL-Rewind策略自动创建可执行的问题-解决方案数据集，并提出f-Plan Boosting方法提取高级调试计划。

Result: 基于Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B的Bird-Fixer模型在BIRD-CRITIC-PG上达到38.11%成功率，超过Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4.1等专有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为SQL调试能力的民主化迈出重要一步，开源模型在复杂SQL任务中展现出竞争力。

Abstract: Resolution of complex SQL issues persists as a significant bottleneck in
real-world database applications. Current Large Language Models (LLMs), while
adept at text-to-SQL translation, have not been rigorously evaluated on the
more challenging task of debugging SQL issues. To address this gap, we
introduce BIRD-CRITIC, a new SQL issue debugging benchmark comprising 530
PostgreSQL tasks (BIRD-CRITIC-PG) and 570 multi-dialect tasks
(BIRD-CRITIC-Multi), distilled from authentic user issues and replayed within
new environments to facilitate rigorous evaluation. Baseline evaluations
underscore the task's complexity, with the leading reasoning model O3-Mini
achieving only 38.87% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 33.33% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi. Meanwhile, advancing open-source models for database tasks
is crucial for empowering local development while safeguarding data privacy.
Therefore, we present Six-Gym (Sql-fIX-Gym), a training environment for
elevating open-source model capabilities for SQL issue debugging. This
environment leverages SQL-Rewind strategy, which automatically generates
executable issue-solution datasets by reverse-engineering issues from verified
SQLs. However, popular trajectory-based fine-tuning methods do not explore
substantial supervisory signals. We further propose f-Plan Boosting, which
extracts high-level debugging plans from SQL solutions, enabling teacher LLMs
to produce 73.7% more successful trajectories for training. We integrate these
components into an open-source agent, Bird-Fixer. Based on Qwen-2.5-Coder-14B,
Bird-Fixer achieves 38.11% success rate on BIRD-CRITIC-PG and 29.65% on
BIRD-CRITIC-Multi, surpassing leading proprietary models such as
Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, marking a significant step toward democratizing
sophisticated SQL-debugging capabilities. The leaderboard and source code are

TL;DR: 提出高阶图数据库（HO-GDBs），通过提升和降低范式扩展传统图数据库，支持高阶交互，提升分析任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图数据库系统无法支持超越一阶关系的高阶交互，而这些交互对于子图计数、多元建模和高阶图学习等任务至关重要。

Method: 引入高阶图数据库（HO-GDBs），采用提升和降低范式，提供轻量级、模块化且可并行化的原型，支持超图、节点元组和子图等结构。

Result: 原型系统在大规模高阶OLTP和OLAP工作负载中表现良好，将图神经网络在GDB中的准确率提升44%，并确保低延迟和高查询吞吐量。

Conclusion: HO-GDBs成功扩展了传统图数据库的功能，支持高阶交互，提升了分析任务的性能和准确性，同时保持ACID合规性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph databases (GDBs) have been driving interest in
large-scale analytics, yet current systems fail to support higher-order (HO)
interactions beyond first-order (one-hop) relations, which are crucial for
tasks such as subgraph counting, polyadic modeling, and HO graph learning. We
address this by introducing a new class of systems, higher-order graph
databases (HO-GDBs) that use lifting and lowering paradigms to seamlessly
extend traditional GDBs with HO. We provide a theoretical analysis of OLTP and
OLAP queries, ensuring correctness, scalability, and ACID compliance. We
implement a lightweight, modular, and parallelizable HO-GDB prototype that
offers native support for hypergraphs, node-tuples, subgraphs, and other HO
structures under a unified API. The prototype scales to large HO OLTP & OLAP
workloads and shows how HO improves analytical tasks, for example enhancing
accuracy of graph neural networks within a GDB by 44%. Our work ensures low
latency and high query throughput, and generalizes both ACID-compliant and
eventually consistent systems.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）在教育中的广泛应用，学生的滥用可能影响学习效果。本文旨在通过教学提示帮助学生更有效地利用LLM来促进学习。

Method: 研究首先提出'教学提示'理论框架，随后通过教师调查（N=36）设计互动学习干预系统，并利用情景教学对CS初学者（N=22）进行前后测试评估。

Result: 结果显示，学生在LLM教学提示技能上有显著提升，对系统持积极态度，并更愿意在未来使用教学提示。

Conclusion: 研究表明，教学提示框架和互动学习工具能有效提升学生基于LLM的学习能力，具有广泛推广潜力。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) applications since 2022,
their use in education has sparked both excitement and concern. Recent studies
consistently highlight students' (mis)use of LLMs can hinder learning outcomes.
This work aims to teach students how to effectively prompt LLMs to improve
their learning. We first proposed pedagogical prompting, a
theoretically-grounded new concept to elicit learning-oriented responses from
LLMs. To move from concept design to a proof-of-concept learning intervention
in real educational settings, we selected early undergraduate CS education
(CS1/CS2) as the example context. We began with a formative survey study with
instructors (N=36) teaching early-stage undergraduate-level CS courses to
inform the instructional design based on classroom needs. Based on their
insights, we designed and developed a learning intervention through an
interactive system with scenario-based instruction to train pedagogical
prompting skills. Finally, we evaluated its instructional effectiveness through
a user study with CS novice students (N=22) using pre/post-tests. Through mixed
methods analyses, our results indicate significant improvements in learners'
LLM-based pedagogical help-seeking skills, along with positive attitudes toward
the system and increased willingness to use pedagogical prompts in the future.
Our contributions include (1) a theoretical framework of pedagogical prompting;
(2) empirical insights into current instructor attitudes toward pedagogical
prompting; and (3) a learning intervention design with an interactive learning
tool and scenario-based instruction leading to promising results on teaching
LLM-based help-seeking. Our approach is scalable for broader implementation in
classrooms and has the potential to be integrated into tools like ChatGPT as an
on-boarding experience to encourage learning-oriented use of generative AI.

Conclusion: HARPT作为公开资源，可支持健康信息学、网络安全和自然语言处理领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present HARPT, a large-scale annotated corpus of mobile health app store
reviews aimed at advancing research in user privacy and trust. The dataset
comprises over 480,000 user reviews labeled into seven categories that capture
critical aspects of trust in applications, trust in providers and privacy
concerns. Creating HARPT required addressing multiple complexities, such as
defining a nuanced label schema, isolating relevant content from large volumes
of noisy data, and designing an annotation strategy that balanced scalability
with accuracy. This strategy integrated rule-based filtering, iterative manual
labeling with review, targeted data augmentation, and weak supervision using
transformer-based classifiers to accelerate coverage. In parallel, a carefully
curated subset of 7,000 reviews was manually annotated to support model
development and evaluation. We benchmark a broad range of classification
models, demonstrating that strong performance is achievable and providing a
baseline for future research. HARPT is released as a public resource to support
work in health informatics, cybersecurity, and natural language processing.

TL;DR: CAM-NET是一个高效AI模型，用于预测从地表到电离层的中性大气变量，准确度高且计算速度快，比传统方法快1000倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模整个大气层对理解重力波传播及其对高层大气动力学的影响至关重要，传统方法计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: CAM-NET采用球形傅里叶神经算子（SFNO）捕捉全球尺度大气动力学，模块化架构分离核心动力学与示踪剂预测，提升计算效率。

Result: CAM-NET在WACCM-X数据集上训练，精度相当但推理速度快1000倍，几分钟内可完成一年模拟，并成功预测关键大气参数。

Conclusion: CAM-NET通过模块化设计和高效计算，为大气建模提供了快速准确的解决方案，适用于多种示踪剂场景。

Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model
designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to
the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate
modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward
propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and
coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier
Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while
preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets
from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and
ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to
WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide
one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively
predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,
temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling
approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET
introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction
from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary
physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables
are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for
efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational
cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this
approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 明确AI Safety与AI Security的边界有助于精准研究方向、促进跨学科合作、提升政策有效性，最终推动可信AI系统的落地。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into critical
systems across various domains, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. While
its integration brings immense benefits, it also introduces significant risks,
including those arising from AI misuse. Within the discourse on managing these
risks, the terms "AI Safety" and "AI Security" are often used, sometimes
interchangeably, resulting in conceptual confusion. This paper aims to
demystify the distinction and delineate the precise research boundaries between
AI Safety and AI Security. We provide rigorous definitions, outline their
respective research focuses, and explore their interdependency, including how
security breaches can precipitate safety failures and vice versa. Using clear
analogies from message transmission and building construction, we illustrate
these distinctions. Clarifying these boundaries is crucial for guiding precise
research directions, fostering effective cross-disciplinary collaboration,
enhancing policy effectiveness, and ultimately, promoting the deployment of
trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: 研究支持CAI工具在大班教学中提升学生互动性的潜力，并讨论了相关发现的意义。

Abstract: Lucrative career prospects and creative opportunities often attract students
to enroll in computer science majors and pursue advanced studies in the field.
Consequently, there has been a significant surge in enrollment in computer
science courses, resulting in large class sizes that can range from hundreds to
even thousands of students. A common challenge in such large classrooms is the
lack of engagement between students and both the instructor and the learning
material. However, with advancements in technology and improvements in large
language models (LLMs), there is a considerable opportunity to utilize
LLM-based AI models, such as conversational artificial intelligence (CAI), to
enhance student engagement with learning content in large classes. To explore
the potential of CAI to support engagement, especially with learning content,
we designed an activity in a software Engineering course (with a large class
size) where students used CAI for an in-class activity. We conducted a
within-subject investigation in a large classroom at a US university where we
compared student engagement during an in-class activity that used CAI tool vs.
one without CAI tool. The CAI tool we used was ChatGPT due to its widespread
popularity and familiarity. Our results indicate that CAI (ChatGPT) has the
potential to support engagement with learning content during in-class
activities, especially in large class sizes. We further discuss the
implications of our findings.

### [215] [LLM-Based Social Simulations Require a Boundary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19806)
*Zengqing Wu,Run Peng,Takayuki Ito,Chuan Xiao*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该立场论文主张，基于大语言模型（LLM）的社会模拟需设定明确边界，以有效推动社会科学研究。尽管LLM在模拟人类行为方面优于传统方法，但其存在行为同质化等局限，需关注对齐性、一致性和鲁棒性三大边界问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何通过设定边界，使LLM社会模拟更可靠地服务于社会科学研究，解决其行为同质化、模式发现可靠性不足等核心问题。

Method: 提出三大边界问题（对齐性、一致性、鲁棒性）的分析框架，并设计启发式边界标准及实用性检查清单。

Result: 明确LLM模拟更适用于群体模式（非个体轨迹）、符合现实平均行为（允许有限方差）及可验证鲁棒性的场景，并提供操作指南。

Conclusion: 通过边界约束和验证方法，LLM社会模拟可在特定范围内有效补充传统社会科学研究方法。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social
simulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to
social science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling
human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face
fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern
discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''
that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for
simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:
alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency
(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness
(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for
determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science
understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when
focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)
agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited
variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation
robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in
determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了机器学习代理在大型PDE系统中数值不稳定的问题，提出了基于Mori-Zwanzig形式主义的稳定化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习代理在大型PDE系统中数值不稳定的问题，现有方法在提高代理精度或增加结构方面效果有限。

Method: 以粘性Burgers'-ML系统为原型，分析不稳定原因并提出稳定化策略，进一步探索基于Mori-Zwanzig形式主义的方法以提高精度。

Result: 提出了稳定耦合系统的策略，并通过Mori-Zwanzig方法提升了系统的精度。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂系统中的机器学习代理稳定性问题提供了新思路，Mori-Zwanzig方法在提升精度方面具有潜力。

Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger
PDE systems is the onset of instabilities when solved numerically. Efforts
towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy
of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered
limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw
insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a
viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the
instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve
the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the
Mori--Zwanzig formalism.

TL;DR: 美国大学的高性能计算（HPC）资源增长远低于国家和工业界，需通过联合计算和资源共享缩小差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和数据密集型科学的快速发展对HPC需求激增，但大学HPC资源增长滞后，需评估现状并提出改进方案。

Method: 调查50多所美国顶尖研究机构，分析计算能力、架构设计、治理模式和能效，并与DOE及工业界系统对比。

Result: 大学HPC年增长率约18%，远低于国家（43%）和工业界（78%），GPU密集型AI加剧了能力差距。

Conclusion: 需采用联合计算、闲置GPU利用和成本分摊模式，推动校园AI训练的民主化，确保HPC资源的公平和可持续访问。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI, data-intensive science, and digital twin technologies
has driven an unprecedented demand for high-performance computing (HPC) across
the research ecosystem. While national laboratories and industrial hyperscalers
have invested heavily in exascale and GPU-centric architectures,
university-operated HPC systems remain comparatively under-resourced. This
survey presents a comprehensive assessment of the HPC landscape across U.S.
universities, benchmarking their capabilities against Department of Energy
(DOE) leadership-class systems and industrial AI infrastructures. We examine
over 50 premier research institutions, analyzing compute capacity,
architectural design, governance models, and energy efficiency. Our findings
reveal that university clusters, though vital for academic research, exhibit
significantly lower growth trajectories (CAGR $\approx$ 18%) than their
national ($\approx$ 43%) and industrial ($\approx$ 78%) counterparts. The
increasing skew toward GPU-dense AI workloads has widened the capability gap,
highlighting the need for federated computing, idle-GPU harvesting, and
cost-sharing models. We also identify emerging paradigms, such as decentralized
reinforcement learning, as promising opportunities for democratizing AI
training within campus environments. Ultimately, this work provides actionable
insights for academic leaders, funding agencies, and technology partners to
ensure more equitable and sustainable HPC access in support of national
research priorities.

TL;DR: 该研究旨在为大型科学合作项目开发一个动态模型，以优化数据和工作流管理，通过分析真实数据和使用生成式AI模拟负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型科学合作项目如ATLAS、Belle II等产生海量数据，当前的数据和工作流管理方法效率不足，缺乏快速可靠的动态模型来优化决策。

Method: 利用PanDA工作流管理系统的真实执行记录，识别关键性能指标，并开发生成式AI模型模拟负载时间序列。

Result: 确定了排队时间、错误率和远程数据访问等关键指标，并构建了包含显性和隐性特征的生成模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为优化大型科学合作项目的数据和工作流管理提供了新的动态模型和AI驱动方法。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific collaborations like ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, and
others involve hundreds of research institutes and thousands of researchers
spread across the globe. These experiments generate petabytes of data, with
volumes soon expected to reach exabytes. Consequently, there is a growing need
for computation, including structured data processing from raw data to
consumer-ready derived data, extensive Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and a
wide range of end-user analysis. To manage these computational and storage
demands, centralized workflow and data management systems are implemented.
However, decisions regarding data placement and payload allocation are often
made disjointly and via heuristic means. A significant obstacle in adopting
more effective heuristic or AI-driven solutions is the absence of a quick and
reliable introspective dynamic model to evaluate and refine alternative
approaches. In this study, we aim to develop such an interactive system using
real-world data. By examining job execution records from the PanDA workflow
management system, we have pinpointed key performance indicators such as
queuing time, error rate, and the extent of remote data access. The dataset
includes five months of activity. Additionally, we are creating a generative AI
model to simulate time series of payloads, which incorporate visible features
like category, event count, and submitting group, as well as hidden features
like the total computational load-derived from existing PanDA records and
computing site capabilities. These hidden features, which are not visible to
job allocators, whether heuristic or AI-driven, influence factors such as
queuing times and data movement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基因组模型无法有效处理全长环状eccDNA，受限于单核苷酸分辨率或二次方注意力机制的低效性。

Method: 结合前向和反向传递进行全上下文表示学习，采用线性时间复杂度的新型增强策略保持环状结构。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上表现出强分类性能，可扩展至200 Kbp序列。

Conclusion: eccDNAMamba为环状基因组建模提供了高效稳健的框架。

Abstract: Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) plays key regulatory roles and
contributes to oncogene overexpression in cancer through high-copy
amplification and long-range interactions. Despite advances in modeling, no
pre-trained models currently support full-length circular eccDNA for downstream
analysis. Existing genomic models are either limited to single-nucleotide
resolution or hindered by the inefficiency of the quadratic attention
mechanism. Here, we introduce eccDNAMamba, the first bidirectional state-space
encoder tailored for circular DNA sequences. It combines forward and reverse
passes for full-context representation learning with linear-time complexity,
and preserves circular structure through a novel augmentation strategy. Tested
on two real-world datasets, eccDNAMamba achieves strong classification
performance and scales to sequences up to 200 Kbp, offering a robust and
efficient framework for modeling circular genomes. Our codes are available at

*Matyas Bohacek,Thomas Fel,Maneesh Agrawala,Ekdeep Singh Lubana*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统方法，通过稀疏自编码器识别生成图像模型的概念盲点，发现模型在生成图像时存在特定概念的缺失或过度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成图像模型在大规模数据集上表现优异，但在生成某些简单概念（如人手或四物体组合）时仍存在明显失败。这些失败模式是否反映模型的结构性限制尚不明确。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取可解释的概念嵌入，通过训练包含32,000个概念的RA-SAE，定量比较真实图像与生成图像中概念的差异。

Result: 应用于四种流行生成模型（Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1、PixArt和Kandinsky），发现特定被抑制的盲点（如鸟食器、DVD光盘）和过度表现的盲点（如木质背景纹理）。

Conclusion: 提出了一个理论框架，通过评估生成模型与数据生成过程的概念保真度，系统识别其概念盲点。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on
large-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple
concepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that
are reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes
have largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether
they reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these
models. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and
characterizing "conceptual blindspots" -- concepts present in the training data
but absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages
sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,
enabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and
generated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with
32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained
analysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models
(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals
specific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces
on documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and
palm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization
artifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates
seen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework
for systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by
assessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying
data-generating process.

Motivation: 金融机构需要准确预测贷款违约概率（PD），而机器学习算法在这一领域的应用相对不足，本文旨在探索机器学习在信用风险分析中的潜力。

Method: 使用随机森林、决策树、XGBoost、梯度提升和AdaBoost五种机器学习算法，与常用的逻辑回归进行比较，基于Scheule等人的基准数据集进行实验。

Abstract: Predicting the probability of default (PD) of prospective loans is a critical
objective for financial institutions. In recent years, machine learning (ML)
algorithms have achieved remarkable success across a wide variety of prediction
tasks; yet, they remain relatively underutilised in credit risk analysis. This
paper highlights the opportunities that ML algorithms offer to this field by
comparing the performance of five predictive models-Random Forests, Decision
Trees, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost-to the predominantly used
logistic regression, over a benchmark dataset from Scheule et al. (Credit Risk
Analytics: The R Companion). Our findings underscore the strengths and
weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights into the most effective
ML algorithms for PD prediction in the context of loan portfolios.

Motivation: 现有MSFP综述多局限于单一任务或研究领域（如自动驾驶），且仅从多模态融合角度展开，缺乏对多视角、时序融合等多样性的考量。

Method: 1. 介绍MSFP背景；2. 综述多模态与多智能体融合方法；3. 分析时序融合方法；4. 探索多模态大模型融合技术。

Result: 构建了一个任务无关的MSFP技术分类框架，覆盖多维度融合方法，并指出当前研究空白。

Conclusion: 该综述为跨领域研究者提供统一视角，助力MSFP技术发展，同时提出未来研究方向（如实时性、可解释性等）。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI,
which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and
semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and
swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods
have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing
surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For
one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such
as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other
related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most
surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion,
while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as
multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope
to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are
reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the
background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods.
A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we
also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help
researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible
insights for future research.

TL;DR: MoLE架构通过混合语言专家模块，平衡了多语言编程的效率与专业性，优于单一模型和独立模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在支持多语言编程时，要么牺牲专业性（单一模型），要么计算和存储成本高（独立模型），需要一种平衡方案。

Method: 提出MoLE架构，包含基础模型、共享LoRA模块和语言特定LoRA模块，联合优化并自动路由。

Result: MoLE在参数效率上优于独立LoRA，同时在准确性上超过单一共享模型。

Conclusion: MoLE有效平衡了多语言编程的效率与专业性，为相关任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
aiding developers with tasks like code comprehension, generation, and
translation. Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across
multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a
single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but
sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning
separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization
but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication
of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel
architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual
programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank
adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These
modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective
knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During
inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module
corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated.
Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency
compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a
single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.

Method: 设计并实现了一个基于N3DR的流程，利用Instant-ngp、Nerfacto和Splatfacto等先进模型，通过小型无人机拍摄的图像提升3D重建质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，N3DR增强的流程显著提高了重建质量，使小型无人机能够在受限环境中支持高精度3D映射和异常检测。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了N3DR在提升小型无人机系统能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has
expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However,
this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight
dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission
capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these
limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV
systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small
static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based
pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and
Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the
object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the
considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them
against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves
reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support
high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In
more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing
the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.

Motivation: 传统的阈值逻辑门（TLG）由于其线性特性，分类能力有限，需要依赖网络完成复杂任务。为了提升单单元的分类性能，研究提出了receptron模型。

Method: 通过引入非线性输入依赖权重函数，构建receptron模型，并在3D空间中的立方体域内验证其选择性激活特性，进一步扩展到n维空间。

Result: 研究表明，receptron在模拟输入时表现出内在的选择性激活特性，且该模型可扩展到多维应用，显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 基于receptron的网络可作为一种新型设备，用于管理大量模拟输入，适用于需要高选择性和分类能力且无需复杂训练的边缘应用。

Abstract: Threshold logic gates (TLGs) have been proposed as artificial counterparts of
biological neurons with classification capabilities based on a linear predictor
function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The linearity of
TLGs limits their classification capabilities requiring the use of networks for
the accomplishment of complex tasks. A generalization of the TLG model called
receptron, characterized by input-dependent weight functions allows for a
significant enhancement of classification performances even with the use of a
single unit. Here we formally demonstrate that a receptron, characterized by
nonlinear input-dependent weight functions, exhibit intrinsic selective
activation properties for analog inputs, when the input vector is within cubic
domains in a 3D space. The proposed model can be extended to the n-dimensional
case for multidimensional applications. Our results suggest that
receptron-based networks can represent a new class of devices capable to manage
a large number of analog inputs, for edge applications requiring high
selectivity and classification capabilities without the burden of complex
training.

Motivation: 电力电子领域对快速准确的时域仿真工具需求增加，传统物理方法速度较慢，数据驱动方法虽快但精度有限，需改进以平衡速度与精度。

Method: 使用BiLSTM-PINN模型仿真闭环DC-DC升压转换器的时域响应，并与物理信息全连接神经网络（FCNN）和BiLSTM模型进行性能对比。

Result: BiLSTM-PINN和BiLSTM模型的RMSE中值分别比FCNN高9倍和4.5倍，标准差更小，表现更一致。

Conclusion: BiLSTM-PINN是电力电子仿真的潜在替代方案，兼具速度和准确性优势。

Abstract: The growing reliance on power electronics introduces new challenges requiring
detailed time-domain analyses with fast and accurate circuit simulation tools.
Currently, commercial time-domain simulation software are mainly relying on
physics-based methods to simulate power electronics. Recent work showed that
data-driven and physics-informed learning methods can increase simulation speed
with limited compromise on accuracy, but many challenges remain before
deployment in commercial tools can be possible. In this paper, we propose a
physics-informed bidirectional long-short term memory neural network
(BiLSTM-PINN) model to simulate the time-domain response of a closed-loop dc-dc
boost converter for various operating points, parameters, and perturbations. A
physics-informed fully-connected neural network (FCNN) and a BiLSTM are also
trained to establish a comparison. The three methods are then compared using
step-response tests to assess their performance and limitations in terms of
accuracy. The results show that the BiLSTM-PINN and BiLSTM models outperform
the FCNN model by more than 9 and 4.5 times, respectively, in terms of median
RMSE. Their standard deviation values are more than 2.6 and 1.7 smaller than
the FCNN's, making them also more consistent. Those results illustrate that the
proposed BiLSTM-PINN is a potential alternative to other physics-based or
data-driven methods for power electronics simulations.

behaviors. This paper explores how NCAs perform when applied to tasks requiring
precise transformations and few-shot generalization, using the Abstraction and

challenges their capabilities in ways not previously explored. Specifically,
this paper uses gradient-based training to learn iterative update rules that
transform input grids into their outputs from the training examples and apply
them to the test inputs. Results suggest that gradient-trained NCA models are a
promising and efficient approach to a range of abstract grid-based tasks from
ARC. Along with discussing the impacts of various design modifications and
training constraints, this work examines the behavior and properties of NCAs
applied to ARC to give insights for broader applications of self-organizing

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种时间正则化训练方法（TRT），通过引入时间依赖的正则化机制来增强脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的泛化能力，有效缓解过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于脉冲神经网络在处理基于事件的神经形态数据时具有事件驱动和低功耗的特点，但直接训练的SNNs由于神经形态数据集的规模有限和梯度不匹配问题，存在严重的过拟合问题，限制了其泛化性能。

Method: 论文提出了一种时间正则化训练（TRT）方法，通过引入时间依赖的正则化机制，对早期时间步施加更强的约束，并通过Fisher信息分析揭示了时间信息集中（TIC）现象。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，TRT能够有效缓解过拟合，平坦化训练损失景观，显著提升模型的泛化性能。

Conclusion: TRT方法通过时间衰减的正则化机制，引导网络在信息丰富的早期时间步学习鲁棒特征，从而显著提升了SNNs的泛化能力。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to
their event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly
effective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have
shown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to
the limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching
problem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In
this paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by
introducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger
constraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other
state-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,
ImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of
TRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape
visualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can
effectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,
thereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical
interpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results
of Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics
inside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,
revealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher
information progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying
regularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to
learn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading
to significant improvements in model generalization. Code is available at

*Jason Benjamin Baretz,Max Fieg,Vijay Ganesh,Aishik Ghosh,V. Knapp-Perez,Jake Rudolph,Daniel Whiteson*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的自主模型构建框架AMBer，用于高效搜索粒子物理理论模型空间，并在中微子味混合理论中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粒子物理理论模型构建通常依赖理论家的直觉，且需要大量工作选择合适的对称群、场表示和提取预测数据。AMBer旨在自动化这一过程，提高效率。

Method: 开发了AMBer框架，通过强化学习代理与简化物理软件管道的交互，自动选择对称群、粒子内容和群表示，构建可行模型并最小化自由参数。

Result: AMBer在已知理论空间中验证有效，并成功探索了一个新的未研究对称群，展示了其在中微子味混合理论中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: AMBer不仅适用于中微子味混合理论，未来还可扩展到其他理论模型构建问题，展示了强化学习在物理模型搜索中的广阔前景。

Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor
mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's
construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires
considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field
representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data.
We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a
reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software
pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups,
particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable
models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate
our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration
to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the
context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning
with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical
model-building problems in the future.

### [230] [NAADA: A Noise-Aware Attention Denoising Autoencoder for Dental Panoramic Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19387)
*Khuram Naveed,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声感知自注意力方法（NAADA），用于增强牙科全景X光片的去噪效果，显著提升了高频细节的恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积去噪自编码器（DAEs）在恢复图像时倾向于保留低频特征（如平滑区域），而忽略高频细节（如细微解剖结构），这在牙科X光片中尤为重要。现有自注意力机制虽能缓解此问题，但常优先处理干净区域特征，忽视噪声区域的关键特征。

Method: 提出噪声感知自注意力方法，使模型能有效聚焦并恢复噪声区域的关键特征，并基于此构建噪声感知注意力增强去噪自编码器（NAADA）网络。

Result: 与Uformer、MResDNN等先进方法相比，NAADA在细节重建和图像质量上表现更优，提升了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: NAADA通过噪声感知自注意力机制，显著改善了牙科X光片的去噪效果，尤其在保留高频细节方面表现突出。

Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image
restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth
regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss
of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where
preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention
mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features,
conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to
cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the
model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy
regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware
attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy
panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and
much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the
reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.

*Benjamin Graham*

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速、轻量级的深度学习神经网络（FLIR）用于心脏图像配准，以高效计算心脏应变，保持高精度同时显著减少推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像配准在心脏图像分析中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法因缺乏真实变换标签和计算效率低而受限，需一种快速且准确的方法以适应临床需求。

Method: 设计了一种高效的卷积架构（FLIR模型），通过体积配准方法快速预测组织运动，用于量化心脏应变，避免传统分块方法对动态器官的精度影响。

Result: FLIR方法在保持与先进模型相近的配准精度的同时，大幅缩短推理时间，且应变计算结果在不同时间采集的数据中表现高度一致。

Conclusion: FLIR模型为心脏应变量化提供了一种快速、可靠的解决方案，适合在研究和临床环境中广泛应用。

Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such
as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics
can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for
deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible
to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can
produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have
been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods
take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a
deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings,
it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level
hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration
but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a
highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use
of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)
is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly
efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to
other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform
inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used
to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain
experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at
approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured
between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric,
strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.

TL;DR: 提出归一化哈希编码器和映射一致性初始化策略，解决CBCT重建中局部-全局训练不匹配问题，提升训练稳定性和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT重建因投影数据有限成为不适定问题，现有NeRF方法因哈希编码器与神经网络的局部-全局训练不匹配导致特征错位、训练不稳定。

Method: 引入归一化哈希编码器增强特征一致性；提出映射一致性初始化策略，利用预训练模型初始化网络以提升早期训练稳定性。

Result: 在4个数据集128例CT数据上验证，方法显著提升训练效率，加速收敛并改善重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过简单有效的改进解决了局部-全局优化不匹配问题，为CBCT重建提供了稳定高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging.
However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make
reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods
have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a
local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash
encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a
subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all
parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash
features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from
different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different
training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated
inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,
slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate
the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a
Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the
mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)
strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the
global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural
network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster
convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet
effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving
training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets,
covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果分解分析在利用最优处理策略（OTRs）时，依赖无遗漏假设，但缺乏针对二元风险因素的遗漏混杂因素分析方法。

Method: 扩展了基于模拟的敏感性分析，模拟未测量的混杂因素，并提出了一种正式的混杂强度基准策略。

Result: 通过高中纵向研究2009（HSLS:09）展示了敏感性分析和基准方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了二元风险因素遗漏混杂分析的空白，为因果分解分析提供了更稳健的工具。

Abstract: Causal decomposition analysis aims to assess the effect of modifying risk
factors on reducing social disparities in outcomes. Recently, this analysis has
incorporated individual characteristics when modifying risk factors by
utilizing optimal treatment regimes (OTRs). Since the newly defined
individualized effects rely on the no omitted confounding assumption,
developing sensitivity analyses to account for potential omitted confounding is
essential. Moreover, OTRs and individualized effects are primarily based on
binary risk factors, and no formal approach currently exists to benchmark the
strength of omitted confounding using observed covariates for binary risk
factors. To address this gap, we extend a simulation-based sensitivity analysis
that simulates unmeasured confounders, addressing two sources of bias emerging
from deriving OTRs and estimating individualized effects. Additionally, we
propose a formal bounding strategy that benchmarks the strength of omitted
confounding for binary risk factors. Using the High School Longitudinal Study
2009 (HSLS:09), we demonstrate this sensitivity analysis and benchmarking
method.

Motivation: 扩散模型通过概率流生成高质量图像，但其理论理解尚不完善。研究旨在理解概率流何时收敛到训练样本或数据流形上的其他点。

Method: 使用浅层ReLU神经网络去噪器，分析最小L2范数训练下的概率流，并通过正交数据集和简化得分流进行对比研究。

Result: 概率流会收敛到训练点、训练点的和或流形上的点。随着训练样本增加，记忆化现象减少。

Conclusion: 扩散模型既能记忆训练样本，也能生成结合多个样本特征的新点，简化设置下的研究为理解其行为提供了理论基础。

Abstract: While diffusion models generate high-quality images via probability flow, the
theoretical understanding of this process remains incomplete. A key question is
when probability flow converges to training samples or more general points on
the data manifold. We analyze this by studying the probability flow of shallow
ReLU neural network denoisers trained with minimal $\ell^2$ norm. For
intuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal
datasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training
point or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion
time scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.
This reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training
samples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,
motivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these
results to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,
confirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training
points, or a manifold point. Moreover, memorization decreases when the number
of training samples grows, as fewer samples accumulate near training points.

Motivation: 研究贝叶斯神经网络在高维结构化估计问题中的理论性能，证明其在处理复杂函数结构时的有效性。

Method: 使用稀疏或连续收缩先验的贝叶斯神经网络，分析其在各项异性Besov空间及其分层组合上的后验收缩率。

Result: 证明了这些先验能够实现依赖于真实结构内在维度的最优收缩率，并具备自适应调整能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为贝叶斯神经网络在高维问题中的实际应用提供了理论支持，扩展了其适用范围。

Abstract: This work establishes that sparse Bayesian neural networks achieve optimal
posterior contraction rates over anisotropic Besov spaces and their
hierarchical compositions. These structures reflect the intrinsic
dimensionality of the underlying function, thereby mitigating the curse of
dimensionality. Our analysis shows that Bayesian neural networks equipped with
either sparse or continuous shrinkage priors attain the optimal rates which are
dependent on the intrinsic dimension of the true structures. Moreover, we show
that these priors enable rate adaptation, allowing the posterior to contract at
the optimal rate even when the smoothness level of the true function is
unknown. The proposed framework accommodates a broad class of functions,
including additive and multiplicative Besov functions as special cases. These
results advance the theoretical foundations of Bayesian neural networks and
provide rigorous justification for their practical effectiveness in
high-dimensional, structured estimation problems.

*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了经典非对称二元感知器（ABP）及其局部熵（LE）作为算法难度的潜在来源，发现典型解与高效算法之间的悖论，并通过提升随机对偶理论（RDT）框架解析了LE在计算间隙中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ABP的局部熵（LE）如何反映其算法难度，解释为何在SAT相中典型解看似导致普遍算法难度，但高效算法仍能在接近容量时找到罕见密集簇。

Method: 利用完全提升的随机对偶理论（fl RDT）及其大偏差升级版（sfl LD RDT）框架，分析ABP的非典型特征（如LE），并在第二级提升中验证与复本方法的一致性。

Result: 发现LE在α∈(0.77,0.78)区间内崩溃，与当前最佳ABP求解器能处理的α范围（0.75-0.77）基本吻合，表明LE行为可能是计算间隙存在的关键反映。

Conclusion: LE的单调性或崩溃与非典型簇的稀疏化密切相关，支持了计算间隙存在的假设，为ABP的算法难度提供了理论解释。

Abstract: We study classical asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) and associated
\emph{local entropy} (LE) as potential source of its algorithmic hardness.
Isolation of \emph{typical} ABP solutions in SAT phase seemingly suggests a
universal algorithmic hardness. Paradoxically, efficient algorithms do exist
even for constraint densities $\alpha$ fairly close but at a finite distance
(\emph{computational gap}) from the capacity. In recent years, existence of
rare large dense clusters and magical ability of fast algorithms to find them
have been posited as the conceptual resolution of this paradox. Monotonicity or
breakdown of the LEs associated with such \emph{atypical} clusters are
predicated to play a key role in their thinning-out or even complete
defragmentation.
  Invention of fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [90,93,94] allows
studying random structures \emph{typical} features. A large deviation upgrade,
sfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \emph{atypical} features
characterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a
generic framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the
second level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching
those obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we
obtain that LE breaks down for $\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which
basically matches $\alpha\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers
can handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among
key reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了具有随机参数的ReLU神经网络在不同ℓ^p范数下的Lipschitz常数，发现其行为在p∈[1,2)和p∈[2,∞]区间内存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机初始化ReLU神经网络在不同ℓ^p范数下的Lipschitz常数，以理解其在不同参数空间中的行为差异。

Method: 使用变体He初始化权重，对称分布初始化偏置，推导宽网络在高概率下的上下界，并分析浅层网络的匹配边界。

Result: 在p∈[2,∞]时，Lipschitz常数类似于高斯向量的ℓ^p'范数；在p∈[1,2)时，则更接近高斯向量的ℓ^2范数。

Conclusion: ReLU神经网络的ℓ^p-Lipschitz常数在不同p区间表现出截然不同的行为，这对理解网络的理论性质具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper studies the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constants of ReLU neural networks
$\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ with random parameters for $p \in
[1,\infty]$. The distribution of the weights follows a variant of the He
initialization and the biases are drawn from symmetric distributions. We derive
high probability upper and lower bounds for wide networks that differ at most
by a factor that is logarithmic in the network's width and linear in its depth.
In the special case of shallow networks, we obtain matching bounds. Remarkably,
the behavior of the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant varies significantly between
the regimes $ p \in [1,2) $ and $ p \in [2,\infty] $. For $p \in [2,\infty]$,
the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant behaves similarly to $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}$, where
$g \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vector and $1/p +
1/p' = 1$. In contrast, for $p \in [1,2)$, the $\ell^p$-Lipschitz constant
aligns more closely to $\Vert g \Vert_{2}$.

Motivation: 理解在线搜索行为的时间模式对实时营销和趋势预测至关重要，但Google Trends数据的高维和噪声特性给聚类分析带来挑战。

Method: 研究评估了三种无监督聚类方法：SAX、eSAX和TDA，应用于20个代表主要消费类别的Google Trends关键词。

Result: SAX和eSAX对稳定时间序列快速且可解释，但在处理波动和复杂数据时表现不佳；TDA通过持续同调捕捉全局结构特征，聚类效果更优。

Conclusion: 建议在消费者分析中结合符号和拓扑方法，未来混合方法具有较大应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding temporal patterns in online search behavior is crucial for
real-time marketing and trend forecasting. Google Trends offers a rich proxy
for public interest, yet the high dimensionality and noise of its time-series
data present challenges for effective clustering. This study evaluates three
unsupervised clustering approaches, Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX),
enhanced SAX (eSAX), and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), applied to 20 Google
Trends keywords representing major consumer categories. Our results show that
while SAX and eSAX offer fast and interpretable clustering for stable time
series, they struggle with volatility and complexity, often producing ambiguous
``catch-all'' clusters. TDA, by contrast, captures global structural features
through persistent homology and achieves more balanced and meaningful
groupings.
  We conclude with practical guidance for using symbolic and topological
methods in consumer analytics and suggest that hybrid approaches combining both
perspectives hold strong potential for future applications.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了均值漂移算法的收敛性证明，针对足够大的带宽和径向对称正定核，证明了其在任意维度下的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均值漂移算法在聚类和图像分割中有广泛应用，但其收敛性在一般情况下尚未得到严格证明。本文旨在进一步推广已有结果，放宽对核函数的限制。

Method: 利用Schoenberg和Bernstein对径向对称正定核的两种替代表征，并借鉴了先前论文中的证明步骤。

Result: 证明了在足够大的带宽下，使用任何径向对称且严格正定核的均值漂移算法在任意维度下都能保证收敛。

Conclusion: 尽管结果在带宽限制上比某些现有研究更严格，但采用了不同的假设和证明技术，为均值漂移算法的收敛性提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: The mean shift (MS) is a non-parametric, density-based, iterative algorithm
that has prominent usage in clustering and image segmentation. A rigorous proof
for its convergence in full generality remains unknown. Two significant steps
in this direction were taken in the paper \cite{Gh1}, which proved that for
\textit{sufficiently large bandwidth}, the MS algorithm with the Gaussian
kernel always converges in any dimension, and also by the same author in
\cite{Gh2}, proved that MS always converges in one dimension for kernels with
differentiable, strictly decreasing, convex profiles. In the more recent paper
\cite{YT}, they have proved the convergence in more generality,\textit{ without
any restriction on the bandwidth}, with the assumption that the KDE $f$ has a
continuous Lipschitz gradient on the closure of the convex hull of the
trajectory of the iterated sequence of the mode estimate, and also satisfies
the {\L}ojasiewicz property there.
  The main theoretical result of this paper is a generalization of those of
\cite{Gh1}, where we show that (1) for\textit{ sufficiently large bandwidth}
convergence is guaranteed in any dimension with \textit{any radially symmetric
and strictly positive definite kernels}. The proof uses two alternate
characterizations of radially symmetric positive definite smooth kernels by
Schoenberg and Bernstein \cite{Fass}, and borrows some steps from the proofs in
\cite{Gh1}. Although the authors acknowledge that the result in that paper is
more restrictive than that of \cite{YT} due to the lower bandwidth limit, it
uses a different set of assumptions than \cite{YT}, and the proof technique is
different.

Abstract: For more than a decade now, academicians and online platform administrators
have been studying solutions to the problem of bot detection. Bots are computer
algorithms whose use is far from being benign: malicious bots are purposely
created to distribute spam, sponsor public characters and, ultimately, induce a
bias within the public opinion. To fight the bot invasion on our online
ecosystem, several approaches have been implemented, mostly based on
(supervised and unsupervised) classifiers, which adopt the most varied account
features, from the simplest to the most expensive ones to be extracted from the
raw data obtainable through the Twitter public APIs. In this exploratory study,
using Twitter as a benchmark, we compare the performances of four state-of-art
feature sets in detecting novel bots: one of the output scores of the popular
bot detector Botometer, which considers more than 1,000 features of an account
to take a decision; two feature sets based on the account profile and timeline;
and the information about the Twitter client from which the user tweets. The
results of our analysis, conducted on six recently released datasets of Twitter
accounts, hint at the possible use of general-purpose classifiers and
cheap-to-compute account features for the detection of evolved bots.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强大但不信任的LLM与本地弱模型的方法，通过Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning和同态加密技术保护用户隐私，在性能上优于单独使用GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在使用大型语言模型（LLM）作为个人代理时，面临隐私泄露的风险。当前的选择要么是将敏感数据发送给不可信的LLM提供商，要么在本地运行性能较弱的模型。本文旨在解决这一隐私与性能的权衡问题。

Method: 采用Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning方法，首先将通用非隐私查询发送给强大的LLM生成CoT提示和子查询，然后使用同态加密向量数据库进行加密语义搜索，最后将解密后的记录和CoT提示输入本地语言模型生成最终响应。

Result: 在LoCoMo长上下文QA基准测试中，结合GPT-4o和本地Llama-3.2-1B的混合框架比单独使用GPT-4o性能提升高达7.1个百分点。

Conclusion: 该研究为在不可信的强大LLM和本地弱模型之间分解任务并保护用户隐私的系统迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents,
accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records.
Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which
are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers,
increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful
models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a
powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and
detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these
sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our
Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a
single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal
documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity.
Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language
model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark,
our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model,
outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This
demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split
between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.

Abstract: Prompt injection threatens novel applications that emerge from adapting LLMs
for various user tasks. The newly developed LLM-based software applications
become more ubiquitous and diverse. However, the threat of prompt injection
attacks undermines the security of these systems as the mitigation and defenses
against them, proposed so far, are insufficient. We investigated the
capabilities of early prompt injection detection systems, focusing specifically
on the detection performance of techniques implemented in various open-source
solutions. These solutions are supposed to detect certain types of prompt
injection attacks, including the prompt leak. In prompt leakage attacks, an
attacker maliciously manipulates the LLM into outputting its system
instructions, violating the system's confidentiality. Our study presents
analyzes of distinct prompt leakage detection techniques, and a comparative
analysis of several detection solutions, which implement those techniques. We
identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and elaborate on
their optimal configuration and usage in high-stake deployments. In one of the
first studies on existing prompt leak detection solutions, we compared the
performances of LLM Guard, Vigil, and Rebuff. We concluded that the
implementations of canary word checks in Vigil and Rebuff were not effective at
detecting prompt leak attacks, and we proposed improvements for them. We also
found an evasion weakness in Rebuff's secondary model-based technique and
proposed a mitigation. Then, the result of the comparison of LLM Guard, Vigil,
and Rebuff at their peak performance revealed that Vigil is optimal for cases
when minimal false positive rate is required, and Rebuff is the most optimal
for average needs.

*Pablo Moriano,Steven C. Hespeler,Mingyan Li,Maria Mahbub*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次对自适应异常检测（AAD）在信息物理系统（CPS）中的研究进行了系统性文献综述（SLR），分析了2013-2023年的65篇论文，提出了新的分类法，并指出了当前研究的局限性与未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对信息物理系统的网络攻击快速演变，传统基于历史特征的方法难以有效应对。自适应异常检测（AAD）因其快速数据处理和模型适应能力成为研究热点，但缺乏系统性综述。

Method: 通过系统性文献综述（SLR）方法，收集并分析了397篇相关论文中的65篇（47篇研究论文和18篇综述论文），提出了一种涵盖攻击类型、CPS应用、学习范式、数据管理和算法的新分类法。

Result: 分析发现现有研究多聚焦于数据处理或模型适应中的单一方向，极少同时兼顾两者。研究还总结了当前技术的局限性，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该综述为研究人员提供了AAD领域的现状概览，帮助实践者了解最新进展，并指出了需在数据与模型协同适应等方面进一步探索。

Abstract: Modern cyberattacks in cyber-physical systems (CPS) rapidly evolve and cannot
be deterred effectively with most current methods which focused on
characterizing past threats. Adaptive anomaly detection (AAD) is among the most
promising techniques to detect evolving cyberattacks focused on fast data
processing and model adaptation. AAD has been researched in the literature
extensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
systematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.
We present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and
systematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD
in CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy
considering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,
and algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed
works focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model
adaptation) but rarely in both at the same time. We aim to help researchers to
advance the state of the art and help practitioners to become familiar with
recent progress in this field. We identify the limitations of the state of the
art and provide recommendations for future research directions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习中网络拓扑结构可能导致隐私泄露，研究发现不同知识水平的攻击者能推断敏感数据分布，并提出结构噪声注入作为有效防御措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私研究多关注基于梯度的攻击，而网络拓扑知识对隐私的影响研究不足。本文旨在分析拓扑结构在不同对抗知识场景下的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 系统评估4720次攻击实例，分析六种对抗知识场景，提出三种攻击向量：通信模式分析、参数幅度分析和结构位置相关性分析，并验证结构噪声注入的防御效果。

Result: 在完全知识条件下，三种攻击成功率分别为84.1%、65.0%和47.2%。80%的部分知识场景攻击效果仍高于安全阈值，结构噪声注入可额外减少51.4%的攻击。

Conclusion: 网络拓扑是联邦学习中的基本隐私漏洞，但通过拓扑感知的防御机制可以有效缓解这些漏洞。

Abstract: Federated learning systems increasingly rely on diverse network topologies to
address scalability and organizational constraints. While existing privacy
research focuses on gradient-based attacks, the privacy implications of network
topology knowledge remain critically understudied. We conduct the first
comprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic
adversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying
degrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns
even under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic
evaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial
knowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge
configurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three
complementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter
magnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success
rates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.
Critically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain
attack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge
configurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete
knowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and
empirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense
mechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional
attack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques. These
results establish that network topology represents a fundamental privacy
vulnerability in federated learning systems while providing practical pathways
for mitigation through topology-aware defense mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: WebGuard++提出融合URL和HTML特征进行恶意URL检测，通过跨尺度编码器、子图感知编码器、双向耦合模块和投票模块解决现有方法的四个缺陷，显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意URL检测方法存在四个问题：URL建模不完整、HTML图稀疏、单向分析以及决策不透明。WebGuard++旨在解决这些问题，提升检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: WebGuard++包含四个组件：跨尺度URL编码器（分层学习URL特征）、子图感知HTML编码器（分解DOM图并增强稀疏信号）、双向耦合模块（对齐URL和HTML嵌入）和投票模块（定位恶意区域）。

Result: 实验表明，WebGuard++在固定FPR（0.001和0.0001）下，TPR比现有方法提高1.1x-7.9x。

Conclusion: WebGuard++通过多模态特征融合和双向交互，显著提升了恶意URL检测的准确性和可解释性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: URL+HTML feature fusion shows promise for robust malicious URL detection,
since attacker artifacts persist in DOM structures. However, prior work suffers
from four critical shortcomings: (1) incomplete URL modeling, failing to
jointly capture lexical patterns and semantic context; (2) HTML graph sparsity,
where threat-indicative nodes (e.g., obfuscated scripts) are isolated amid
benign content, causing signal dilution during graph aggregation; (3)
unidirectional analysis, ignoring URL-HTML feature bidirectional interaction;
and (4) opaque decisions, lacking attribution to malicious DOM components. To
address these challenges, we present WebGuard++, a detection framework with 4
novel components: 1) Cross-scale URL Encoder: Hierarchically learns
local-to-global and coarse to fine URL features based on Transformer network
with dynamic convolution. 2) Subgraph-aware HTML Encoder: Decomposes DOM graphs
into interpretable substructures, amplifying sparse threat signals via
Hierarchical feature fusion. 3) Bidirectional Coupling Module: Aligns URL and
HTML embeddings through cross-modal contrastive learning, optimizing
inter-modal consistency and intra-modal specificity. 4) Voting Module:
Localizes malicious regions through consensus voting on malicious subgraph
predictions. Experiments show WebGuard++ achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 1.1x-7.9x higher TPR at fixed FPR of
0.001 and 0.0001 across both datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PrivacyXray框架通过分析LLM内部状态检测隐私泄露，无需外部验证数据，平均准确率达92.69%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在敏感领域应用广泛，但存在推理过程中隐私泄露风险，现有攻击方法无法验证信息准确性，缺乏公开数据集验证。

Method: 提出PrivacyXray框架，通过分析LLM生成正确隐私信息时的语义连贯性和概率确定性，使用四种指标检测隐私泄露。

Result: 在五个LLM上平均准确率达92.69%，比现有方法提升20.06%，展现稳定性和实用性。

Conclusion: PrivacyXray有效解决隐私检测中缺乏开源数据集和外部验证依赖问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in sensitive domains, including
healthcare, finance, and legal services, raising concerns about potential
private information leaks during inference. Privacy extraction attacks, such as
jailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the
models to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify
whether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets
exist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information
detection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel
framework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic
certainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray
detects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer
semantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.
PrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by
overcoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on
external data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of
realistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of
LLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with
an average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average
accuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility
in real-world applications.

*Saeed Mahloujifar,Chuan Guo,G. Edward Suh,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为特征差分隐私（FDP）的新框架，用于在特定保护属性上提供隐私保护，相比传统差分隐私（DP）能显著提高模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私（DP）对所有数据进行统一保护，但在某些应用中只需保护特定属性，导致不必要的效用损失。因此需要一种更灵活、针对性强的隐私保护方法。

Method: 提出特征差分隐私（FDP）框架，支持增删和替换隐私变体，并允许自适应分离保护和非保护特征。改进DP-SGD算法以满足FDP，同时利用子采样等优势。

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上训练扩散模型时，FDP在ε=8时FID从286.7显著提升至101.9，同时提供强隐私保证。

Conclusion: FDP为隐私数据分析提供了新方法，能在保护特定属性的同时显著降低效用损失，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has become the standard for private data analysis.
Certain machine learning applications only require privacy protection for
specific protected attributes. Using naive variants of differential privacy in
such use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,
we refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework
that we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is
simulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants
of privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and
non-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive
composition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference
attacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that
satisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via
sub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show
that it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public
features are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ
dataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to
DP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a
training image is available as a public feature. Overall, our work provides a
new approach to private data analysis that can help reduce the utility cost of
DP while still providing strong privacy guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IQFMs的混合量子-经典框架，通过迭代连接浅层量子特征映射和经典计算的增强权重，减少量子运行时间并缓解噪声影响，在噪声量子数据任务中表现优于量子卷积神经网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习模型在特定分类任务中展现出强大的表达能力和量子加速潜力，但在实际量子硬件上部署深度量子特征映射面临噪声和硬件限制的挑战，且变分量子算法在梯度估计上存在计算瓶颈。

Method: 采用迭代量子特征映射（IQFMs）框架，结合对比学习和分层训练机制，通过浅层量子特征映射和经典计算的增强权重构建深度架构，避免变分量子参数的优化。

Result: 数值实验表明，IQFMs在噪声量子数据任务中优于量子卷积神经网络，且在经典图像分类基准测试中表现接近经典神经网络。

Conclusion: IQFMs为解决当前量子增强机器学习的限制提供了一条有前景的路径，能够有效减少量子资源需求并提升性能。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Conclusion: 该框架高效、可扩展，为量子态工程和噪声抑制提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子机器学习面临高维数据嵌入低量子比特系统的挑战，且现有方法如量子自编码器受限于硬件能力并易受重建攻击。

Method: qPGA利用黎曼几何将数据投影到单位希尔伯特球面上，生成适合量子振幅编码的输出，减少量子比特需求。

Result: 在MNIST等数据集上，qPGA比量子自编码器更有效保留局部结构，抗攻击能力更强，分类任务准确率超过99%。

Conclusion: qPGA为量子机器学习提供了一种可扩展、抗噪声的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Result: 实验表明，COM-QEL在基准任务中比QEL找到的真实目标值更高。

Conclusion: COM-QEL结合量子神经网络表达力和保守建模，显著提升离线设计问题的优化效果。

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

Motivation: 现有雷达信号恢复ECG的方法依赖高质量信号和大量训练数据，限制了在新场景中的应用。本文旨在解决数据稀缺下的ECG恢复问题。

Method: 提出CFT算法动态追踪心脏位置以获取高质量雷达信号，并设计RFcardi模型，利用心脏特征稀疏性从雷达信号中提取心脏信息，仅需少量雷达-ECG配对数据微调模型。

Result: 实验表明，CFT能准确定位心脏，RFcardi模型通过少量训练数据即可生成高保真ECG恢复结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限的新场景中有效实现了基于雷达信号的ECG恢复，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been
successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the
performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous
radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due
to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery
in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking
(CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient
acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning
model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the
radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of
cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to
fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results
reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and
the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using
a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are
available after the publication.

Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on
small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a
large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges.
First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that
can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second,
the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer
subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an
unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128
channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in
multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network
baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and
demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across
tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of
adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly,
predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might
identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of
personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances
spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational
psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both
fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SemPA-Look的语义分组聚合框架，通过前瞻搜索算法优化令牌分组，以在中断信道下最大化原始和接收令牌消息的平均令牌相似度（ATS），显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和大语言模型（LLM）中，令牌的语义依赖于上下文，单个令牌的丢失会严重扭曲原始消息语义。传统比特独立处理的方式不适用于令牌通信（TC），因此需要优化令牌分组以提升语义保持能力。

Method: 提出SemPA-Look框架，引入残差语义分数（RSS）作为令牌级替代指标，结合前瞻搜索算法，通过固定深度和宽度的采样策略，实现线性复杂度的令牌分组优化。

Result: 在MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SemPA-Look的ATS和LPIPS分数接近穷举搜索，计算复杂度降低40倍，相比遗传算法（GA）复杂度降低10倍。

Conclusion: SemPA-Look在保持高语义相似度的同时显著降低计算复杂度，适用于远程AIGC和其他TC应用，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Tokens are fundamental processing units of generative AI (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs), and token communication (TC) is essential for enabling
remote AI-generate content (AIGC) and wireless LLM applications. Unlike
traditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each
token depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency
makes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can
significantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this
paper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token
similarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage
channels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is
combinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To
address this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with
lookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces
the residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the
message-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain
token packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a
lookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates
without replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates
sampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.
Experiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned
images) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores
comparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up
to 40$\times$. Compared to other linear-complexity algorithms such as the
genetic algorithm (GA), SemPA-Look achieves 10$\times$ lower complexity,
demonstrating its practicality for remote AIGC and other TC applications.

Method: 结合规则基础的正则表达式转换和GPT-4优化，部分无法完全处理的情况采用尽力而为策略。

Result: 评估显示，Reptile成功转换了73.7%的正则表达式，优化后的模式F1分数和MCC均超过0.91。

Conclusion: Reptile为迁移到现代日志分析平台提供了高效、可靠的自动化转换工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Log files provide valuable information for detecting and diagnosing problems
in enterprise software applications and data centers. Several log analytics
tools and platforms were developed to help filter and extract information from
logs, typically using regular expressions (RegExes). Recent commercial log
analytics platforms provide domain-specific languages specifically designed for
log parsing, such as Grok or the Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL). However,
users who want to migrate to these platforms must manually convert their
RegExes into the new pattern language, which is costly and error-prone. In this
work, we present Reptile, which combines a rule-based approach for converting
RegExes into DPL patterns with a best-effort approach for cases where a full
conversion is impossible. Furthermore, it integrates GPT-4 to optimize the
obtained DPL patterns. The evaluation with 946 RegExes collected from a large
company shows that Reptile safely converted 73.7% of them. The evaluation of
Reptile's pattern optimization with 23 real-world RegExes showed an F1-score
and MCC above 0.91. These results are promising and have ample practical
implications for companies that migrate to a modern log analytics platform,
such as Dynatrace.

### [257] [Which Company Adjustment Matter? Insights from Uplift Modeling on Financial Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19049)
*Xinlin Wang,Mats Brorsson*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 该论文将提升建模应用于公司财务调整的效果分析，提出了一种考虑时间依赖性的新框架MTDnet，实验证明调整时机的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公司调整通常是一系列时间依赖的复杂行动，现有提升建模方法多针对二元、多元或连续处理，难以直接应用。研究旨在分析这些调整对财务影响，并考虑其时间顺序。

Method: 首先用两种元学习器和三种经典提升模型将调整简化为二元处理进行分析；随后提出新框架MTDnet以处理调整的时间依赖性。

Result: 实验基于卢森堡公司财务数据，表明MTDnet能有效捕捉调整的时间依赖性，简化二元处理方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 公司调整的效果评估需考虑时间顺序，MTDnet框架为此提供了有效解决方案，验证了时序因素的关键作用。

Abstract: Uplift modeling has achieved significant success in various fields,
particularly in online marketing. It is a method that primarily utilizes
machine learning and deep learning to estimate individual treatment effects.
This paper we apply uplift modeling to analyze the effect of company adjustment
on their financial status, and we treat these adjustment as treatments or
interventions in this study. Although there have been extensive studies and
application regarding binary treatments, multiple treatments, and continuous
treatments, company adjustment are often more complex than these scenarios, as
they constitute a series of multiple time-dependent actions. The effect
estimation of company adjustment needs to take into account not only individual
treatment traits but also the temporal order of this series of treatments. This
study collects a real-world data set about company financial statements and
reported behavior in Luxembourg for the experiments. First, we use two
meta-learners and three other well-known uplift models to analyze different
company adjustment by simplifying the adjustment as binary treatments.
Furthermore, we propose a new uplift modeling framework (MTDnet) to address the
time-dependent nature of these adjustment, and the experimental result shows
the necessity of considering the timing of these adjustment.

*Aleksandr Algazinov,Matt Laing,Paul Laban*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MATE的多模态可访问性多智能体系统，通过模态适应技术为残障人士提供定制化辅助，支持本地运行和隐私保护，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前技术普遍缺乏对多样化用户需求的支持，尤其是残障人士在数字环境中面临障碍。现有多智能体系统因闭源设计导致定制化不足，无法提供全面辅助。

Method: 开发MATE系统，支持多模态转换（如图像转音频描述），集成LLM API和自定义ML分类器，并引入ModCon-Task-Identifier模型精准识别用户输入的模态转换需求。

Result: 实验表明ModCon-Task-Identifier在自定义数据上优于其他LLM和统计模型，MATE系统可广泛应用于医疗等领域，且本地运行保障数据安全。

Conclusion: MATE通过开源框架和灵活架构显著提升了数字可访问性，为残障用户提供了高效、隐私安全的实时辅助解决方案。

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many
technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs.
Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive
assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from
closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently
encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital
environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs
the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for
assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to
an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and
receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.
MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as
healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The
system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using
custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the
system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of
hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy
and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be
effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital
healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce
ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise
modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that
ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical
models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

Conclusion: 该研究为未知环境下持续演化的顺序拍卖提供了理论框架和实用算法，扩展了动态机制设计的应用边界。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online dynamic mechanism design for sequential
auctions in unknown environments, where the underlying market and, thus, the
bidders' values vary over time as interactions between the seller and the
bidders progress. We model the sequential auctions as an infinite-horizon
average-reward Markov decision process (MDP), where the transition kernel and
reward functions are unknown to the seller. In each round, the seller
determines an allocation and a payment for each bidder. Each bidder receives a
private reward and submits a sealed bid to the seller. The state, which
represents the underlying market, evolves according to an unknown transition
kernel and the seller's allocation policy. Unlike existing works that formulate
the problem as a multi-armed bandit model or as an episodic MDP, where the
environment resets to an initial state after each round or episode, our paper
considers a more realistic and sophisticated setting in which the market
continues to evolve without restarting. We first extend the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, which is known to be efficient,
truthful, and individually rational for one-shot static auctions, to sequential
auctions, thereby obtaining a dynamic VCG mechanism counterpart that preserves
these desired properties. We then focus on the online setting and develop an
online reinforcement learning algorithm for the seller to learn the underlying
MDP model and implement a mechanism that closely resembles the dynamic VCG
mechanism. We show that the learned online mechanism asymptotically converges
to a dynamic mechanism that approximately satisfies efficiency, truthfulness,
and individual rationality with arbitrarily high probability and achieves
guaranteed performance in terms of various notions of regret.

TL;DR: Kling-Foley是一个大规模多模态视频到音频生成模型，通过多模态扩散变换器和视觉语义对齐模块，生成与视频内容同步的高质量音频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决开源基准测试中音频类型和标注不完整的问题，并提升视频与音频的语义和时间对齐能力，提出了Kling-Foley模型。

Method: 采用多模态扩散变换器建模视频、音频和文本的交互，结合视觉语义表示模块和音视频同步模块，并引入通用潜在音频编解码器和立体声渲染方法。

Result: 实验表明，Kling-Foley在分布匹配、语义对齐、时间对齐和音频质量方面达到了公开模型中的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Kling-Foley通过多模态对齐和高质量音频生成技术，显著提升了视频到音频合成的效果，并开源了工业级基准测试Kling-Audio-Eval。

Abstract: We propose Kling-Foley, a large-scale multimodal Video-to-Audio generation
model that synthesizes high-quality audio synchronized with video content. In
Kling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the
interactions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a
visual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization
module to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align
video conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby
improving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with
text conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of
video-matching sound effects. In addition, we propose a universal latent audio
codec that can achieve high-quality modeling in various scenarios such as sound
effects, speech, singing, and music. We employ a stereo rendering method that
imbues synthesized audio with a spatial presence. At the same time, in order to
make up for the incomplete types and annotations of the open-source benchmark,
we also open-source an industrial-level benchmark Kling-Audio-Eval. Our
experiments show that Kling-Foley trained with the flow matching objective
achieves new audio-visual SOTA performance among public models in terms of
distribution matching, semantic alignment, temporal alignment and audio
quality.
