### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EvidenceOutcomes，一个从生物医学文献中提取临床有意义结果的新型大规模标注语料库，并开发了PubMedBERT模型进行有效提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准在提取PICO元素时，往往忽视或简化了最复杂的Outcomes元素，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过与临床医生和自然语言处理专家迭代讨论，制定了提取临床有意义结果的标注指南，并由三名独立标注者对500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP语料库摘要进行标注。

Result: 生成的EvidenceOutcomes语料库具有高质量的标注，标注者间一致性为0.76。PubMedBERT模型在EBM-NLP语料库子集上的F1得分为0.69（实体级）和0.76（标记级）。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为开发和测试未来机器学习算法的共享基准，用于从生物医学摘要中提取临床有意义的结果。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过引入检索增强生成和自我纠正机制，使生成式大语言模型在语义角色标注任务上首次超越编码器-解码器模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成式大语言模型在多种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但在语义角色标注任务上仍落后于编码器-解码器模型，本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 本文提出两种机制：检索增强生成和自我纠正，使大语言模型能够利用外部语言知识并修正不一致的语义角色标注输出。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的语义角色标注基准（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012）上，本文方法在中文和英文中均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 本文首次成功应用大语言模型在语义角色标注任务上超越编码器-解码器方法，展示了其在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了R2AG，一种基于强化学习的检索模型，用于从有限的入院数据生成长篇出院指导，通过优化检索质量和推理路径，提升了临床文本生成的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型（LLM）的临床文本生成方法在生成长篇笔记时表现不佳，尤其在输入信息有限的情况下。因此，本文旨在解决这一问题，提出了一种新的方法以生成更准确的出院指导。

Method: 本文提出了R2AG模型，利用强化学习从医学知识图谱中检索推理路径，为LLM提供显式的语义指导。此外，提出了基于组的检索优化（GRO），通过组相对奖励提高检索质量，鼓励LLM进行更深层次的推理。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上的实验表明，R2AG在临床效果和自然语言生成指标上均优于基线模型，能够填补稀疏输入场景下的语义空白，并帮助LLM避免临床误解。

Conclusion: R2AG通过强化学习优化检索过程，显著提升了长篇临床文本生成的质量，尤其在输入信息有限的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应语义感知典型采样（ASTS），作为本地典型采样（LTS）的改进版本，旨在提升大语言模型文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的解码方法如top-k和核采样在文本生成中难以平衡流畅性、多样性和连贯性，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了自适应语义感知典型采样（ASTS），结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整，以提升文本生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，ASTS在多个基准测试中表现优异，减少了重复，增强了语义对齐，并提高了流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS在保持计算效率的同时，能够生成上下文连贯且多样化的文本，优于现有的采样技术。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了taz2024full，这是迄今为止最大的公开德语报纸语料库，包含1980年至2024年间的180万篇文章，并展示了其在性别偏见研究中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德语的大规模开放语料库有限，限制了语言趋势和社会问题如性别偏见的研究，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文构建了taz2024full语料库，并使用可扩展的结构化分析管道，分析了过去四十年报道中的性别代表性。

Result: 研究发现男性在报道中被过度代表，但近年来逐渐趋向更平衡的报道。

Conclusion: taz2024full语料库支持广泛的应用，从历时语言分析到关键媒体研究，并促进德语自然语言处理中的包容性和可重复性研究。

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究揭示了大型语言模型在电商产品描述生成中存在的独特性别偏见，如服装尺寸假设、特征刻板印象和说服性语言差异，并通过数据驱动分类法与定量分析验证了GPT-3.5和电商专用模型中此类偏见的普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM的性别偏见已在多领域被研究，但其在电商场景的应用可能催生新型算法偏见与危害，而这一领域尚未被充分探索。现有通用危害分类框架难以捕捉此类场景特异性偏差，需开发针对性检测方法。

Method: 构建产品描述生成场景的性别偏见分类体系，并与通用危害分类框架对齐；对GPT-3.5和电商专用LLM进行定量分析，验证分类体系的有效性及偏见的实际发生率。

Result: 发现三类新型偏见：1) 基于性别的服装尺寸预设 2) 产品特征宣传的刻板印象 3) 说服性语言使用差异。实验证明这些偏见在两种模型中普遍存在，补充了现有AI危害框架中的排斥性规范、刻板印象和性能差距维度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在电商场景中未被充分认知的性别偏见维度，表明需开发领域特定的检测与缓解方法。成果扩展了对算法危害分类框架在具体应用场景中的理解，特别是对排斥性规范与刻板印象的运作机制提供了新证据。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker)，一种为LLMs设计的新型时序图学习框架，用于解决LLMs在实时动态图上的应用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在图推理能力方面取得了显著进展，但它们在真实世界的动态图上的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: TGTalker利用时序图中的近期偏差提取相关结构信息，并将其转换为自然语言供LLMs使用，同时利用时序邻居作为预测的额外信息。

Result: 在五个真实世界网络中，TGTalker在链路预测方面与现有的时序图神经网络模型表现相当，并且始终优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型。

Conclusion: TGTalker不仅展示了在时序链路预测中的竞争力，还为每个预测生成文本解释，为时序链路预测的可解释性开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

### [8] [Auto Review: Second Stage Error Detection for Highly Accurate Information Extraction from Phone Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05400)
*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 自动化医保验证电话节省医疗时间，但准确性至关重要。Auto Review系统减少人工审核，通过多ASR替代和伪标签方法提高信息提取准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化医保验证电话可以提高效率，但电话转录中的噪音和领域术语使用影响准确性，需要减少人工审核负担并保持高准确性。

Method: 提出两阶段系统，包括后处理管道，利用多ASR替代和伪标签方法，无需手动校正转录，结合通用大语言模型和特征模型管道。

Result: 实验显示，校正后的电话转录质量显著提高，增强了Auto Review系统的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ASR问题和领域术语挑战，显著提高了信息提取的准确性，减少了人工审核的工作量。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [9] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩框架AsymKV，通过揭示键值缓存中的不对称性（键局部同质、值异质分布），分别设计同质性键合并与无损值压缩方法，显著提升了长上下文建模效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文建模方法因注意力机制二次复杂度面临效率挑战，而传统KV缓存压缩方法未考虑键值对的固有不对称性，导致压缩效果受限。

Method: AsymKV框架：1) 基于注意力权重的局部同质性对相邻键进行动态合并；2) 通过数学证明实现值的无损压缩，避免传统方法对键值统一处理的缺陷。

Result: 在LLaMA3.1-8B等模型上，LongBench平均得分达43.95，显著超越H2O等方法（38.89），且在不同任务和基模型上表现一致优于现有SOTA。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模键值缓存不对称性，AsymKV为高效长上下文建模提供了新范式，其训练无关特性使其具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

*Patrik Czakó,Gábor Kertész,Sándor Szénási*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmoothRot是一种新颖的后训练量化技术，通过整合通道缩放和Hadamard变换，有效提升4位量化在大型语言模型中的效率，减少量化与FP16模型之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的大量激活异常值是4位量化面临的关键挑战，SmoothRot旨在解决这一问题，提升量化精度。

Method: SmoothRot结合通道缩放和Hadamard变换，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B和Mistral 7B等模型上的实验表明，SmoothRot在语言生成和零样本推理任务中，将量化与FP16模型的性能差距减少了10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot有效提升了4位量化的效率，显著减少了量化模型的性能损失，且无需额外推理延迟。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解Wordle游戏中哪些特征会引发用户的幽默感，从而探索游戏中的创意元素。

Method: 从Reddit上抓取了约8万条用户对Wordle游戏的反应，使用GPT-3.5进行少样本提示分类，验证其标签与人类标签的对应关系，并提取预测用户幽默感的特征。

Result: 研究发现，提取的特征确实能提供预测用户幽默感的信号，尽管信号较弱。

Conclusion: 研究表明，用户对Wordle游戏的幽默感可以在一定程度上通过计算预测，揭示了游戏中幽默创意的可测量性。

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

*Hongbo Zhao,Fei Zhu,Rundong Wang,Gaofeng Meng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MLLM-CL基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态现实场景中的持续学习能力，并通过参数隔离和路由机制显著提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在适应动态现实场景时面临挑战，需要持续集成新知识和技能。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了MLLM-CL基准，包含领域和能力持续学习，并通过参数隔离和基于MLLM的路由机制防止灾难性干扰。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够以最小的遗忘集成领域特定知识和功能能力，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL基准和提出的方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型在动态场景中的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

### [13] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过无监督机器学习技术分析了特定语言障碍（SLI）儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，揭示了SLI主要表现为语言生成能力的降低而非句法复杂性缺陷，挑战了传统的分类诊断框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断方法依赖标准化评估，可能忽略细微的发展模式。本研究旨在通过无监督机器学习技术识别SLI儿童的自然语言发展轨迹，为早期识别和针对性干预提供见解。

Method: 研究分析了来自1163名4-16岁儿童的叙事样本，使用主成分分析（PCA）和聚类技术评估了64个语言特征，以揭示发展轨迹并区分语言特征。

Result: 研究发现了两个主要聚类：高语言生成能力和低SLI患病率，以及有限生成能力但较高句法复杂性和高SLI患病率。边界案例展示了中间特征，支持语言能力的连续模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明SLI主要表现为语言生成能力的降低而非句法复杂性缺陷，挑战了分类诊断框架，并突出了无监督学习技术在优化诊断标准和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，尽管其能够回答各种问题，但也带来了安全问题。本文旨在探讨是否可以通过可解释的机器学习方法（如增强关联规则）来改进基于数据集/数据库的回答。

Method: 提出了一种生成规则集的方法，基于定义的知识模式生成规则，通过规则到文本的转换器将规则转换为文本形式，并将其作为RAG集成到LLM中。

Result: 与ChatGPT（即使使用代理）相比，该方法在基于数据集的问题回答上显示出显著改进，并尝试了多种规则生成策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在改进回答效果方面表现出色，未来可以通过结合其他模式或使用规则挖掘作为代理等方式进一步改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are achieving significant progress almost every
moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

*Sara Shields-Menard,Zach Reimers,Joshua Gardner,David Perry,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种利用大语言模型从电子健康记录中回答临床问题的系统，通过两步法提高回答质量，并发现较小模型在识别相关信息上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过电子健康记录（EHRs）准确回答临床问题，提升医疗决策的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先使用大语言模型筛选与问题相关的句子，然后基于这些句子生成简短且有引用的回答。通过few-shot prompting、self-consistency和thresholding优化句子分类。

Result: 发现8B模型在识别相关信息上优于70B模型，且准确的句子选择对生成高质量回答至关重要。

Conclusion: 准确的句子选择和self-consistency结合thresholding可以有效提高回答的可靠性。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出SynthesizeMe方法，通过用户交互生成合成角色进行个性化奖励建模，无需依赖外部身份信息，在Chatbot Arena上提升4.4%的LLM-as-a-judge准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化奖励建模方法过度依赖人口统计资料或预定义偏好类别等外部身份信息，限制了模型对多样化用户偏好的适应性。

Method: 1. 生成并验证解释用户偏好的推理链；2. 从推理中归纳合成用户角色；3. 筛选关键历史交互构建个性化提示模板。

Result: 在Chatbot Arena实现4.4%的个性化LLM评估准确率提升，在包含854名用户数据的新基准PersonalRewardBench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe通过自解释推理生成用户画像，验证了基于交互行为建模个性化偏好的有效性，为LLM对齐提供新范式。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了OPERA数据集，用于评估大语言模型模拟用户网络行为的能力，并建立了首个基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏高质量公开数据集来评估大语言模型模拟真实用户行为的能力，尤其是捕捉用户可观察行为和内部推理的数据集。

Method: 通过在线问卷和自定义浏览器插件收集了真实用户在在线购物会话中的观察、用户画像、细粒度网络行为及即时自我报告的理由，构建了OPERA数据集。

Result: 使用OPERA数据集，建立了首个基准测试，以评估当前大语言模型在给定用户画像和历史行为下预测用户下一步行为和理由的能力。

Conclusion: OPERA数据集为未来研究大语言模型作为个性化数字孪生体的能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究针对阿尔茨海默病筛查中语言模型的性别混杂问题，提出两种去性别权重的过滤方法，发现模型去混杂后检测性能略有下降但更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练语言模型的痴呆检测研究未充分探讨患者叙述文本中说话者性别对模型的影响，需解决性别混杂导致的模型偏差问题。

Method: 提出扩展混杂过滤(Extended Confounding Filter)和双重过滤(Dual Filter)，通过隔离与性别相关的模型权重并对其进行消融，实现去性别化建模。

Result: 实验表明Transformer模型易过拟合训练数据分布，去性别权重后分类器性别干扰减少，但痴呆检测准确率轻微下降(性能与去混杂的权衡)。

Conclusion: 通过权重干预可构建去性别混杂的痴呆检测模型，但需接受检测性能的小幅折损，揭示了模型优化中偏差-性能平衡的重要性。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Method: 本文提出了一种输入依赖的软提示技术（ID-SPAM），该技术通过自注意力机制生成软提示，并根据输入词元分配不同的重要性，从而减少了可训练参数的数量。

Result: 实验结果表明，ID-SPAM在多种任务上优于现有技术，并显著提升了模型的零样本领域迁移能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ID-SPAM技术是一种简单高效的参数微调方法，能够在减少计算成本的同时提升大型语言模型在特定任务中的表现。

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream
tasks by learning a small set of parameters. We propose a novel Input Dependent
Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了当前语言技术在检测和解读极端主义群体使用的加密语言（cryptolects）方面的能力，发现通用大语言模型（LLMs）表现不佳，但通过领域适应和特定提示技术可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端主义群体使用复杂的内部语言（cryptolects）来排除或误导外部人员，本文旨在评估当前语言技术对这些语言的处理能力，以推动自动审核技术的发展。

Method: 研究评估了八个模型在六个任务中的表现，包括检测和解读极端主义平台的加密语言，并采用了领域适应和特定提示技术进行优化。

Result: 结果表明，通用LLMs无法一致地检测或解码极端主义语言，但通过领域适应和特定提示技术可以显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果对自动审核技术的开发和部署提供了重要见解，并发布了包含1940万条极端主义平台帖子的新数据集。

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two
online extremist platforms. Evaluating eight models across six tasks, our
results indicate that general purpose LLMs cannot consistently detect or decode
extremist language. However, performance can be significantly improved by
domain adaptation and specialised prompting techniques. These results provide
important insights to inform the development and deployment of automated
moderation technologies. We further develop and release novel labelled and
unlabelled datasets, including 19.4M posts from extremist platforms and
lexicons validated by human experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在训练过程中如何记忆事实和逐字序列，并探索如何通过合成数据有效区分这两种记忆形式。

Method: 构建了一个包含虚构事件的合成数据集，包括类似网络文本的文档和相关问答对，并通过训练实验进行分析。

Result: 实验表明，使用合成数据可以有效区分语言模型对事实和逐字序列的记忆，同时揭示了构建真实虚构合成数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 合成数据集在研究语言模型的记忆过程中具有潜力，但构建高质量的合成数据仍面临挑战。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

*Priyanka Dey,Yugal Khanter,Aayush Bothra,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CulturalPersonas是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLMs在文化背景下的个性表达，通过3000个情景问题覆盖六个国家，结果显示其在个性分布对齐和文化一致性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在互动应用中的重要性增加，如辅导和心理健康，表达符合文化背景的个性变得至关重要。现有研究大多忽视了文化与个性之间的相互作用。

Method: 引入CulturalPersonas基准测试，包含3000个情景问题，涵盖六个国家，通过多选题和开放式回答格式评估三个LLMs的个性表达。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著提高了LLMs与特定国家个性分布的对齐度（Wasserstein距离减少超过20%），并生成了更具表达力和文化一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas通过结合个性表达和文化细微差别，为LLMs的全球行为规范对齐提供了新方向，推动了更具社会智能和全球适应性的LLMs发展。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了MEFA框架，通过多源证据模糊聚合解决事件因果关系识别中的因果幻觉问题，显著提升了无监督基准的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件因果关系识别模型依赖于大规模标注数据，且大语言模型在零样本识别中容易产生因果幻觉，导致错误因果关系的建立。

Method: MEFA框架将因果关系推理分解为三个主要任务和三个辅助任务，利用精心设计的提示引导大语言模型生成不确定和确定性输出，并通过模糊聚合整合证据进行因果关系评分和判定。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA在F1分数和精确度上分别比次优无监督基准高出6.2%和9.3%，同时显著减少了因果幻觉引发的错误。

Conclusion: 任务分解和模糊聚合的有效性得到了验证，MEFA在事件因果关系识别中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Motivation: 现有语法形式化方法（PSG、DG、CG）在句法分析和计算复杂性方面存在差异，需探索统一框架以整合理论优势并优化自然语言处理的计算效率。

Method: 提出对应原则，分步骤实现三种语法的统一表示，以土耳其语不连续从属子句为例进行理论整合，并分析其对计算复杂性的影响。

Result: 统一表示法能有效处理不连续结构，简化神经认知层面的句法处理复杂度，同时兼容不同语法理论的核心原则，为句法分析提供新框架。

Conclusion: 通过统一表示整合多语法理论，不仅增强句法分析的普适性，还降低计算复杂性，对自然语言处理的理论发展和实际计算模型具有双重意义。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Conclusion: GraphRAG-Bench为GraphRAG的实际应用提供了指导，并收集了相关资源供社区使用。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

Method: 提出POCL框架，包括难度测量器和训练调度器，逐步引入从易到难的训练样本，并应用逐渐升温的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，POCL在各种白盒知识蒸馏方法和模型家族中均能提升学生模型的性能。

Conclusion: 排序的训练样本在知识蒸馏中有效，POCL框架能增强蒸馏后大语言模型的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识图谱和LLM推理的知识遗忘评估框架，发现现有方法高估了遗忘效果，并通过实验验证了新框架的严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘技术主要关注显式删除孤立事实，但忽略了潜在推理依赖关系和知识的非确定性特征，导致事实可能通过关联信息隐式保留。

Method: 构建带置信度分数的知识图谱表示事实上下文，设计基于LLM的推理评估协议，通过校准人类评估确保LLM评判者的可靠性和稳定性。

Result: 新构建的基准测试表明该框架能更真实严格地评估遗忘性能，同时揭示当前评估策略普遍高估实际遗忘效果。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 知识图谱与推理评估相结合的方法能更准确反映知识遗忘效果，现有评估体系存在系统性偏差，需建立更全面的评估范式。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效提升了大语言模型在时间表格问答任务中的表现，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with
LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在7B规模模型上显著提升了长文本生成性能，并在长输入推理任务中展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Writing-RL框架为长文本生成提供了新的解决方案，并可能为长上下文训练提供新的视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG-based LLMs主要专注于单一模态（如文本）信息检索，而在实际应用（如医疗领域）中，相关信息可能以多种模态（如知识图谱、文本、分子结构）存在，因此需要能够检索多模态信息并生成准确响应的能力。

Method: 提出了BioMol-MQA数据集，包含多模态知识图谱（文本和分子结构）和设计用于测试LLM在多模态知识图谱上检索和推理能力的问题。

Result: 基准测试表明，现有LLMs在回答这些问题时表现不佳，只有在提供必要背景数据时才能较好回答，表明需要强大的RAG框架。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在多模态领域特定信息检索和推理方面，现有LLMs的不足，并提出了BioMol-MQA数据集作为解决这一问题的工具。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在时间推理任务（如事件排序和持续时间估计）上表现出色，但其是否能够感知时间流逝并相应调整决策仍未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文通过三个互补实验进行研究：1）提出并验证了Token-Time假设，通过对话持续时间判断任务检验LLMs能否将离散的token数量映射到连续的物理时间；2）展示了LLMs在用户表达紧迫性时如何调整回答长度并保持准确性；3）开发了BombRush，一个交互式导航挑战，研究LLMs在动态环境中如何应对渐进的时间压力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs具备一定的时间感知能力，能够将离散的语言token与连续的物理时间联系起来，但这种能力因模型大小和推理能力而异。

Conclusion: 本文为增强LLMs在时间敏感应用中的时间感知能力奠定了理论基础，表明LLMs能够感知时间流逝并相应调整决策。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在单次推理中难以应对表格问答的复杂推理需求，现有方法缺乏错误检测机制且无法复用问题解决经验，与人类解决问题的方式形成鲜明对比。

Method: MAPLE框架包含四个关键组件：使用ReAct范式进行推理的Solver、用于答案验证的Checker、进行错误诊断和策略修正的Reflector，以及管理长期记忆以复用和进化经验的Archiver。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过模拟人类问题解决过程，提供了一种有效的框架来提升表格问答任务的性能，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

Result: 最佳模型（OpenAI o1 with PoT）在238个高难度问题上的准确率为89.1%，但模型在数值精度上仍面临挑战。结合推理器和编程器模型能有效提升模型性能（如DeepSeek-R1从83.2%提升到87.8%）。

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning为未来在特定领域的复杂推理任务中评估和提升大型推理模型的性能提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for
DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and
improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 研究发现多语言大模型在推理时会偏向其预训练的主导语言，导致低资源语言被侵蚀，且这种语言崩溃现象难以逆转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多语言大模型在多语言推理中的机制，特别是其推理链在不同语言间的表现。

Method: 使用GRPO在中文、韩语和乌克兰语版本的GSM8K和SimpleRL-Zoo数据集上微调多语言大模型，并监控任务准确性和语言一致性。

Result: GRPO迅速放大了预训练语言的不平衡，低资源语言在几百次更新后被侵蚀；语言一致性奖励缓解了这种漂移，但导致准确性下降5-10个百分点；语言崩溃现象严重且难以逆转。

Conclusion: 并非所有语言在推理训练中都是平等的，研究揭示了奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验在多语言推理中的作用。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理能提升大语言模型（LLMs）的问题解决能力，但延长推理链会增加令牌使用成本。许多推理步骤可由更高效的小规模语言模型（SLMs）处理，因此需要一种混合方法，将子任务分配到不同能力的模型中。

Method: 提出R2-Reasoner框架，包含任务分解器和子任务分配器，通过强化模型路由器动态分配子任务。采用监督微调和Group Relative Policy Optimization算法进行训练。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准测试中，R2-Reasoner将API成本降低了86.85%，同时保持或超越基准准确性。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner框架为更经济高效的LLM推理铺平了道路，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Conclusion: MisMitiFact框架高效且成本效益高，适用于大规模误导信息缓解，代码和LLM提示模板已公开。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Conclusion: 异构MoA方法通过动态整合不同结构的PEFT适配器专家，有效解决了同质MoE-LoRA架构中的问题，提升了模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Result: 在多种数学、常识和科学问答基准测试中，DynamicMind表现出卓越的零样本问答能力，并在性能和计算效率之间实现了有效平衡。

Conclusion: DynamicMind通过三模式思维系统，成功提升了大语言模型在零样本问答任务中的性能，并优化了计算资源的使用。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

### [44] [IntentionESC: An Intention-Centered Framework for Enhancing Emotional Support in Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05947)
*Xinjie Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了以意图为中心的情感支持对话框架（IntentionESC）和意图中心链式思考机制（ICECoT），旨在通过明确支持者的意图，生成更有效的情感支持回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在情感支持对话中，意图不明确可能导致支持者采用不当策略，无意中将自身期望或解决方案强加于求助者。明确意图对指导支持者的动机和整个情感支持过程至关重要。

Method: 提出了IntentionESC框架，定义了情感支持对话中支持者的可能意图，并引入ICECoT机制，使大语言模型能够通过分析情感状态、推断意图并选择合适策略来生成回应。设计了自动化标注管道以生成高质量训练数据，并开发了全面的评估方案。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了该框架的有效性，数据和代码已公开。

Conclusion: IntentionESC框架和ICECoT机制能够有效提升情感支持对话的质量，生成更符合人类思维的支持回应。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的数学应用题生成系统，无需额外输入，仅需题目数量、年级和题型即可生成高质量题目，但LLM在符合年级和题型要求上仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学作为复杂学科，学生考试失败率高。手动创建数学应用题耗时且繁琐，现有深度学习方法需要额外输入，限制了效率。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLM）构建数学应用题生成系统，仅需题目数量、年级和题型作为输入。通过不同LLM、提示策略、多样性增强技术及人类反馈提升模型表现。

Result: 生成的应用题质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但LLM在生成符合指定年级和题型要求的题目上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的数学应用题生成系统显著提升了题目生成的效率和质量，但在满足特定年级和题型要求方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的推理时心理理论增强方法Shoes-of-Others前缀法，通过角色代入提示提升大语言模型在非状态变化场景下的心智推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论推理方法主要局限于世界状态变化的场景，且微调方法会损害模型泛化能力，需要开发更通用的推理时增强方法。

Method: 提出Shoes-of-Others前缀法，通过在模型输出前添加'让我们站在A的立场思考'的提示，引导模型代入目标角色视角进行推理。

Result: 在对话和叙事场景的基准测试中，该方法在五类心理状态推理任务上持续提升性能，分析表明提示能有效激发真实思维过程。

Conclusion: SoO前缀法通过角色代入提示机制，以无假设约束的方式显著提升大语言模型的心理理论能力，适用于更广泛场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在较长文档中为分类提供必要上下文段落的挑战，特别是在使用有限上下文窗口的模型时。

Method: 采用实体导向的启发式方法进行上下文选择，并结合XLM-RoBERTa语言模型进行分类。

Result: 该方法在效果上与传统监督微调方法相当，甚至优于使用更大生成语言模型的方法。

Conclusion: 实体导向的上下文选择方法在有限上下文窗口的模型中有效，且能够与更大模型的表现相媲美。

Abstract: Our contribution to the SemEval 2025 shared task 10, subtask 1 on entity
framing, tackles the challenge of providing the necessary segments from longer
documents as context for classification with a masked language model. We show
that a simple entity-oriented heuristics for context selection can enable text
classification using models with limited context window. Our context selection
approach and the XLM-RoBERTa language model is on par with, or outperforms,
Supervised Fine-Tuning with larger generative language models.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Tau-Eval，一个用于评估文本匿名化方法的开源框架，旨在平衡隐私保护和信息保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本匿名化在保护个人隐私的同时，往往会影响文本的实用性，缺乏统一的评估标准使得这一过程更具挑战性。

Method: 提出了Tau-Eval框架，通过隐私和实用性任务的敏感性来评估文本匿名化方法。

Result: 开发了一个Python库，并提供了代码、文档和教程，所有资源均公开可用。

Conclusion: Tau-Eval为文本匿名化方法的评估提供了一个全面的基准，有助于在隐私保护和信息保留之间找到平衡。

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.
A Python library, code, documentation and tutorials are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨大语言模型在多语言和文化背景下的性能差异，特别是文化背景对模型表现的影响。

Method: 通过结合光学字符识别、自动文本提取和人工验证，从罗马尼亚游戏节目中构建了一个丰富的多语言数据集，并对现有大语言模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 模型在国际问题上的准确率（80-95%）显著高于罗马尼亚特定文化问题（50-75%），表明文化背景对模型性能有重要影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化背景对多语言自然语言处理系统的重要性，为构建具备文化意识的多语言系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于token概率分布的动态CoT方法，通过逻辑回归模型动态选择CoT或直接回答，有效减少token消耗并保持高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT技术提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现，但其效果在不同任务中不一致，且其机制尚不明确。本文旨在探索CoT效果的潜在机制，并提出更高效的部署框架。

Method: 本文提出两个基于token概率分布的指标，结合逻辑回归模型，引入动态CoT方法，并扩展至闭源模型。

Result: CoT效果评估指标准确率达89.2%，动态CoT减少超过35%的token消耗，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 本文为CoT推理的潜在机制提供了新视角，并提出了更高效的部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AvR的新方法，通过长链思维（CoT）提升大语言模型（LLMs）的递归推理能力，显著优于传统偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在递归推理能力上存在局限，尤其是在缺乏专家筛选数据的情况下。本文旨在通过长链思维（CoT）解锁LLMs的递归推理潜力。

Method: 本文提出了AvR（Alignment via Refinement）方法，通过集成批评和改进动作的细化过程，结合可微分学习技术优化细化感知奖励，生成多轮数据并组织为长链思维。

Result: 实验结果表明，AvR显著优于传统偏好优化方法，仅使用3k合成样本就将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升了20%以上。

Conclusion: AvR方法通过长链思维和细化过程有效提升了大语言模型的递归推理能力，展示了其在测试时扩展的潜力。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索方法存在三大局限性：过度优化工作流而忽视人类设计的组件、高评估成本以及在大搜索空间中的低效搜索。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 本文提出了一个分层搜索空间，结合了代理工作流和可组合功能组件，并引入预测性能模型来估计代理性能。此外，采用基于不确定性的分层蒙特卡罗树搜索策略来指导搜索。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，本文方法平均性能提升了8.34%，且搜索进度更快，改进轨迹更陡峭。

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架有效解决了现有代理搜索方法的局限性，显著提升了代理系统的性能，并提供了更高效的搜索方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SR-DCR的轻量级框架，通过自反辩论和不对称多代理辩论结合，解决大语言模型在参数知识与上下文输入之间的冲突，提升上下文可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型常面临参数知识与上下文输入之间的冲突，导致事实不一致或幻觉。本文旨在通过自反辩论框架提升模型在上下文中的可靠性。

Method: SR-DCR框架结合了令牌级自置信度和不对称多代理辩论。一个缺乏上下文的批评者挑战一个基于给定段落的辩护者，最后由一个法官模型评估辩论并确定上下文的可靠性，结合模型置信度选择最终答案。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR在保持对可信输入准确性的同时，显著增强了对误导性上下文的鲁棒性，优于传统辩论和仅依赖置信度的基线方法，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: SR-DCR框架有效解决了大语言模型在上下文中的冲突问题，提升了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法依赖相似性或多样性评分选择示例，导致每次查询时从大规模数据集中重复检索，计算成本高。

Method: 提出 FEEDER 框架，引入“充分性”和“必要性”指标，设计树状算法高效识别代表性示例，预选代表性子集。

Conclusion: FEEDER 框架在提升上下文学习效率的同时，保持了性能，并适用于大语言模型的微调。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在解决数学问题方面表现出色，但其作为多模态自动定理证明器的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 本文提出了MATP-BENCH基准，包含1056个多模态定理，涵盖高中、大学和竞赛级数学，并辅以Lean 4、Coq和Isabelle的形式化。

Result: 现有方法只能解决MATP-BENCH中的部分问题，表明该基准为自动定理证明研究提出了开放挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为评估多模态大语言模型在多模态自动定理证明中的能力提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Result: 在开源和API大模型上的实验验证了CatShift在logit不可访问场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了无需模型内部信息的实用解决方案，填补了标签仅存检测方法的技术空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

*Yingqi Hu,Zhuo Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Lizhen Qu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了联邦微调大语言模型（FedLLMs）中的数据提取攻击风险，提出了一种新的攻击方法，并在真实法律数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FedLLMs在保护数据隐私方面具有潜力，但其固有的记忆能力使其容易受到数据提取攻击。本文旨在探讨这种风险，并提出更现实的威胁模型。

Method: 本文设计了针对FedLLMs的简单但有效的提取攻击算法，并提出了覆盖率与效率两个严格指标来评估攻击效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够提取高达56.57%的受害者专属个人身份信息（PII），其中“地址”、“生日”和“姓名”是最易受攻击的类别。

Conclusion: 本文强调了开发强大防御策略的紧迫性，并为未来隐私保护联邦学习研究提供了新的基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的零样本检测方法，通过近似生成代码的原始任务并评估任务条件下的熵，有效区分LLM生成和人类编写的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成代码的增加，检测这类代码对于安全、知识产权和学术诚信至关重要。本文旨在通过条件概率分布改进零样本检测。

Method: 提出了一种基于任务条件（ATC）的零样本检测方法，近似生成代码的原始任务并评估任务条件下的熵，无需访问生成模型或原始任务提示。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并能够跨编程语言（如Python、CPP和Java）进行泛化。

Conclusion: 任务级别的条件对于检测LLM生成的代码至关重要，ATC方法在实际应用中具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

*Qinyue Zheng,Salman Abdullah,Sam Rawal,Cyril Zakka,Sophie Ostmeier,Maximilian Purk,Eduardo Reis,Eric J. Topol,Jure Leskovec,Michael Moor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIRIAD是一个大规模、经过整理的医学QA对语料库，通过半自动化流程从同行评审的医学文献中生成，能够有效提升LLMs在医疗QA任务中的准确性和检测医学幻觉的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLMs在医疗领域生成不准确内容的问题，需要将LLMs与高质量的医学知识结合，但现有的RAG方法依赖于未加工的、非结构化的医学文本，难以有效利用。

Method: 引入MIRIAD语料库，包含5,821,948个医学QA对，通过半自动化流程（LLM生成、过滤、接地和人工注释）从同行评审的医学文献中生成，并以查询-响应的形式封装医学知识。

Result: 实验表明，使用MIRIAD增强LLMs在医疗QA基准测试中的准确性提高了6.7%，检测医学幻觉的能力提升了22.5%到37%。

Conclusion: MIRIAD能够解锁下游应用，如医学信息检索、增强的RAG应用和知识基础的聊天界面，最终使LLMs在医疗领域的应用更加可靠。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过大语言模型生成SQL查询的问题，提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，通过与数据库引擎交互来优化模型，显著提高了SQL代码的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机是探索是否可以通过与数据库引擎的交互来调整大语言模型，而不是依赖于文本-代码对的监督微调，以提高SQL查询生成的准确性。

Method: 本文将该问题构建为一个强化学习问题，模型通过执行反馈获得标量奖励，并在Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)框架中使用这些奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅通过问答对的弱监督，RL-tuning将模型生成的SQL代码的准确性从31.49%提高到49.83%，错误率从25.43%降低到14.71%，接近了更大的SQLCoder-70B模型的性能。

Conclusion: 本文展示了通过执行反馈来提高大语言模型的符号推理能力的潜力，证明了强化学习在代码生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在主观任务中是否能捕捉多视角并反映标注者分歧，发现零样本设置下多视角生成可行，而少样本设置难以捕捉人类判断的全面性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在NLP分类任务中表现优异，但通常依赖于多数投票的聚合标签，可能掩盖了主观标注中的人类分歧。本研究旨在探讨LLMs是否能在主观任务中捕捉多视角并反映标注者分歧。

Method: 使用上下文学习（ICL）在零样本和少样本设置下评估了四种开源LLMs，采用了三种标签建模策略：聚合硬标签、分解硬标签和软标签。在少样本提示中，评估了基于文本相似性（BM25、PLM）、标注分歧（熵）、组合排名和示例排序策略（随机与基于课程）的演示选择方法。

Result: 结果表明，零样本设置下多视角生成是可行的，而少样本设置往往无法捕捉人类判断的全面性。提示设计和演示选择显著影响性能，但示例排序的影响有限。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了用LLMs建模主观性的挑战，以及构建更具视角意识、社会智能模型的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语音搜索和重打分器的语音纠正系统，用于改进端到端自动语音识别模型在新电影标题上的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动语音识别模型依赖高质量配对数据进行训练，但新电影标题在训练数据中可能不足，导致识别效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种语音纠正系统，包括基于ASR输出的语音搜索生成语音替代项，以及结合ASR识别结果和语音替代项的重打分器。

Result: 在热门电影标题基准测试中，该方法相对于基线模型将词错误率相对降低了4.4%到7.6%。

Conclusion: 语音纠正系统有效提升了端到端自动语音识别模型在新电影标题上的识别性能。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自然语言推理（NLI）模型在处理条件句中的预设推理时的表现，并引入了新的数据集CONFER进行评估。研究发现，NLI模型在此类任务上表现不佳，且微调现有数据集并不能显著提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NLI模型在许多推理任务上表现良好，但它们在处理条件句中的细粒度语用推理（特别是预设推理）方面的能力尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 作者引入了CONFER数据集，评估了四种NLI模型（包括两种预训练模型）在条件推理中的泛化能力，并在零样本和少样本提示设置下评估了大型语言模型（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）的预设推理能力。

Result: 研究表明，NLI模型在处理条件句中的预设推理时存在困难，且微调现有NLI数据集并不能显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: NLI模型在处理条件句中的预设推理任务上表现不佳，现有的微调方法无法有效提升其性能，未来需要进一步研究以改进模型在此类任务上的表现。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

Motivation: 本文旨在开发一个易于使用的工具来研究语言模型的上下文词嵌入，并通过实验验证其在特定语境下的语义解释能力。

Method: 作者构建了一个包含450对句子的数据集，每对句子分别使用介词结构和双宾结构，并通过语义特征库分析三个掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入。

Result: 实验结果表明，三个掩码语言模型的上下文词嵌入表现出了预期的敏感性，验证了工具的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文的工具在分析语言模型的上下文词嵌入方面表现出色，展示了其在语义解释研究中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管经过监督微调和强化学习，大语言模型生成的脚本仍有约15%无法执行，本文旨在探究错误率持续存在的原因是模型限制还是单一提示设计。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级多代理管道，使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型，分离草稿、执行、修复和判断步骤。

Result: 在Text2Chart31基准测试中，系统将执行错误率降至4.5%，在ChartX基准测试中错误率为4.6%，显示出强大的泛化能力。但手动审查发现存在幻觉问题，且生成的图表在色盲指南方面的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前基准测试中执行成功率已基本解决，未来工作应转向改进图表美观性、语义保真度和可访问性。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Result: Llama3-8B在包含VP评估标准的提示微调后，性能超越同类小模型且与GPT-4检测器相当，证明专家知识注入比思维链技术更有效。

Conclusion: 在语音钓鱼检测任务中，向小语言模型的提示中注入人类专家知识，相比使用思维链技术能更有效地提升检测性能，使其达到与大型模型相当的水平。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PuzzleWorld，一个包含667个复杂谜题的基准测试，旨在评估模型的开放性和创造性多模态推理能力。现有模型表现不佳，但通过微调小模型，推理能力有所提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理基准测试通常任务明确，而现实世界中的问题（如科学发现、数据分析）往往缺乏明确的结构。Puzzlehunts作为一种复杂的、多步骤的谜题，能够更好地模拟这些开放性问题，但现有模型在此类任务上的表现尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 作者提出了PuzzleWorld，一个大规模的谜题基准测试，包含667个谜题，每个谜题都标注了最终答案、详细的推理路径和认知技能标签。通过微调小模型，使用推理路径进行训练，评估模型的表现。

Result: 大多数最先进的模型在最终答案上的准确率仅为1-2%，最好的模型也只能解决14%的谜题，并在逐步推理中达到40%的准确率。微调小模型后，逐步推理准确率从4%提升至11%，而仅使用最终答案训练则导致性能几乎降至零。

Conclusion: 当前模型在处理开放性问题时存在短视推理、依赖于语言推理的局限性，并缺乏视觉和空间推理所需的绘图能力。PuzzleWorld的发布为未来构建更通用、开放和创造性的推理系统提供了支持。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线内容中的性别歧视检测仍然是一个未解决的问题，现有的自动化系统面临数据稀疏和性别歧视语言微妙性的挑战。

Method: 提出了基于定义的数据增强（DDA）和上下文语义扩展（CSE）技术，并结合多种语言模型的集成策略。

Result: 在EDOS数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有任务中均达到了最先进的性能，特别是在细粒度分类任务中提高了4.1个百分点的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: 本文的方法有效解决了性别歧视检测中的数据稀疏和语言微妙性问题，并显著提高了模型的分类性能。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

### [72] [Bridging External and Parametric Knowledge: Mitigating Hallucination of LLMs with Shared-Private Semantic Synergy in Dual-Stream Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06240)
*Yi Sui,Chaozhuo Li,Chen Zhang,Dawei song,Qiuchi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双流知识增强框架（DSSP-RAG），通过区分共享和私有语义，解决外部知识与LLMs参数知识冲突的问题，并引入无监督幻觉检测和能量商数（EQ）来优化检索的外部知识，提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法在外部知识与LLMs参数知识冲突时表现不佳，缺乏解决冲突的机制，导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升RAG的稳定性和性能。

Method: 提出DSSP-RAG框架，将自注意力机制改进为混合注意力机制，区分共享和私有语义，控制内外知识的整合。引入基于认知不确定性的无监督幻觉检测方法，确保引入知识的必要性，并使用基于注意力差异矩阵的能量商数（EQ）减少外部知识中的噪声。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，DSSP-RAG能有效解决知识冲突，增强双流知识的互补性，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过混合注意力机制和无监督幻觉检测，成功解决了外部知识与LLMs参数知识的冲突问题，提升了生成模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Cartridge的方法，通过离线训练较小的KV缓存来替代传统的大规模上下文学习，显著降低了内存消耗和推理成本，同时保持了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理大规模文本语料时，内存消耗大且成本高，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为Cartridge的方法，通过生成关于语料的合成对话并使用上下文蒸馏目标进行训练，替代传统的上下文学习。

Result: 使用Cartridge方法在长上下文基准测试中匹配了传统方法的性能，同时减少了38.6倍的内存使用，并提高了26.4倍的吞吐量。

Conclusion: Cartridge方法不仅降低了推理成本，还扩展了模型的有效上下文长度，并且可以在推理时无需重新训练进行组合。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdvSumm是一种新的训练框架，通过引入梯度引导的嵌入扰动来减少文本摘要中的偏见，同时保持摘要质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文本摘要中表现出色，但继承了预训练数据中的偏见，导致下游任务输出不公。

Method: AdvSumm引入Perturber组件，在序列到序列模型的嵌入层应用梯度引导的扰动，增强模型对输入变化的鲁棒性。

Result: AdvSumm在多个基准数据集上有效减少了命名-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且不损害摘要质量。

Conclusion: AdvSumm在减少文本摘要偏见方面表现优异，优于标准变压器和回译等数据增强技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出将爱视为被动情感与主动评价判断的串联结构，结合基本形式本体论（BFO）构建严谨的爱的本体论框架，平衡其非理性与理性维度，并为跨学科应用（如AI）提供理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决爱在哲学与科学（心理学、社会学）中的复杂性，强调其本体论定义对人工智能等应用场景的支撑作用。

Method: 采用基本形式本体论（BFO）区分爱的多义性，建立因果关联模型连接情感与认知成分，回应关于感觉-判断关系的质疑。

Result: 成功论证爱作为情感-判断串联结构的合理性，验证因果模型有效性，为爱的形式化研究奠定可扩展本体基础。

Conclusion: 该本体框架使爱成为工程本体论、人工智能等领域的正式研究对象，推动未来跨学科整合与应用创新。

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

*Kristy Wedel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基础范式——上下文记忆智能（CMI），旨在解决生成式AI系统中存在的记忆限制问题，通过结构化捕捉、推理和再生上下文，提升系统的纵向一致性、可解释性和负责任决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI系统在组织中的快速应用面临记忆限制的挑战，现有系统难以存储或反思决策的完整上下文，导致重复错误和缺乏清晰性。

Method: 本文引入了上下文记忆智能（CMI）作为新的基础范式，通过认知科学、组织理论、人机交互和AI治理，将记忆重新定位为适应性基础设施，并提出了Insight Layer模块化架构，结合人类反馈、漂移检测和理由保存，将上下文记忆融入系统。

Result: CMI使系统能够基于数据、历史、判断和变化的上下文进行推理，解决了当前AI架构和治理中的基础盲点，提出了创建有效、反思性、可审计且社会责任的智能系统框架。

Conclusion: CMI增强了人机协作、生成式AI设计以及机构的韧性，为构建智能系统提供了新的方向。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于构造性逻辑推理的学习与规划框架，取代了传统的基于奖励的优化方法，确保了状态转换和策略的可验证性，实现了安全的规划和可信的AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在探索过程中存在不安全或无效的转换，且缺乏解释性。本文旨在通过构造性逻辑推理，确保规划的可靠性和安全性，提供一种新的强化学习方向。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于直觉逻辑的构造性推理框架，将动作、转换和目标表示为逻辑命题，通过构建构造性证明来进行决策，确保每一步转换都有可验证的前提条件。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在结构化网格世界中实现了完美的安全性、可解释的行为和高效的收敛，且没有无效动作，优于传统的Q-learning方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于构造性逻辑和证明理论的强化学习方法，为安全规划、符号认知和可信AI提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据平台过于依赖工具，未能充分满足业务需求，导致效率低下和延迟。为解决这一问题，作者提出了BSDS系统。

Method: BSDS系统采用模块化架构，包括与业务实体关联的精选数据、支持上下文感知AI代理的知识库和高效的数据管道。AI代理在数据访问和系统管理中发挥关键作用。

Result: 通过实际应用验证，BSDS加速了数据驱动项目的上市时间，增强了跨部门协作，并为各种规模的企业提供了可扩展的蓝图。

Conclusion: BSDS系统将数据系统从被动工具转变为主动推动组织增长的驱动力，未来研究可在此基础上探索复杂系统和自适应网络理论的优化策略。

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法在评估复杂行为时，需要为现实环境设计外在奖励函数，而在某些环境中，如死亡状态，无法提供直接反馈。本文旨在通过生物心理学启发的方法，解决这一问题。

Method: 本文引入了一种基于早期杏仁核发展的内在奖励函数，并通过记忆增强神经网络（MANN）架构实现。通过调整恐惧反应的激活阈值，模拟了广泛性焦虑障碍（GADs）的行为。

Result: 在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中，本文提出的方法成功模拟了恐惧条件反射行为，避免了终端状态的探索，并展示了与广泛性焦虑障碍相关的行为。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种生物启发的神经网络架构和框架，用于恐惧条件反射范式，并实证了在具有非描述性终端条件的环境中，构建的代理能够有效避免探索终端状态。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了KITE框架，首次大规模研究AI模型的知识转移能力，发现模型表现与协作结果关系不一致，知识转移需专门优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型的推理能力是否也能提高知识转移能力，即模型能否以人类理解、应用和学习的方式传递推理过程。

Method: 引入KITE框架，进行两阶段实验：人类先与AI共同构思问题解决策略，然后独立实施解决方案，以隔离模型解释对人类理解的影响。

Result: 研究发现，尽管模型基准表现与协作结果相关，但这种关系并不一致，存在显著异常值，表明知识转移需要专门优化。

Conclusion: 知识转移需要专门优化，行为与策略因素是成功知识转移的中介。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MMTU，一个包含30K个问题的大规模基准测试，旨在全面评估模型在专家级别上理解和操作表格的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在处理表格方面取得了显著进展，但相关能力的综合基准测试仍然有限，限制了我们对这一领域的理解和模型发展。

Method: MMTU基准测试包含25个现实世界中的表格任务，涵盖了从表格理解、推理到编码等多种技能。

Result: 即使是最前沿的推理模型如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1，在MMTU上的表现也仅为60%左右，显示出仍有显著改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU基准测试的引入有望推动结构化数据处理和分析基础模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多限制代理在预定义流程中执行特定任务，本文旨在自动化工作流程规划，以实现更高层次的自主性。

Method: MAPPS由工作流程规划器、工具代码生成器和科学协调器组成，利用大语言模型生成多步工作流程，并合成可执行代码，协调科学家反馈以确保鲁棒性。

Result: 在MP-20数据上评估，MAPPS在稳定性、独特性和新颖性方面比现有生成模型提升了五倍。

Conclusion: MAPPS是一个有前景的自主材料发现框架，通过整合规划、物理和科学家反馈，实现了灵活且可靠的材料发现。

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法在聚合多个评估者的偏好时，往往优先考虑更广泛持有的意见，这可能导致政策偏向某些意见或群体。本文旨在解决这一问题，开发一种能够使聚合意见和政策与评估者偏好的真实人口分布成比例的框架。

Method: 本文方法直接从成对比较数据中推断评估者人口分布的可行集，并构建满足社会选择理论基本公理（单调性和帕累托效率）以及新引入的人口比例代表和人口边界鲁棒性公理的政策。提出了一种软最大松弛方法，平滑地权衡人口比例代表与Condorcet胜者的选择。

Result: 通过在表格推荐任务和大规模语言模型对齐上的实验，验证了该方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的偏好学习框架能够有效解决传统方法中的偏见问题，并通过实验证明了其在实际应用中的可行性和效果。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

Abstract: Recent advances in conversational AI have been substantial, but developing
real-time systems for perceptual task guidance remains challenging. These
systems must provide interactive, proactive assistance based on streaming

a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

Motivation: 当前LLM代理通常采用通用方法，缺乏对用户需求和偏好的灵活响应，因此开发了PersonaAgent以解决个性化任务。

Method: PersonaAgent结合了个性化记忆模块（包括情景和语义记忆机制）和个性化行动模块，核心是通过用户独特的系统提示（persona）来协调记忆与行动。

Result: 实验证明，PersonaAgent在个性化行动空间和实时应用扩展方面显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaAgent展示了在提供定制化、动态用户体验方面的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Result: 实验表明RefPlan显著提升保守策略性能，在数据稀缺和高不确定性场景下保持鲁棒，且适应动态环境变化。

Conclusion: RefPlan通过统一不确定性建模与模型规划，增强了离线策略的灵活性、泛化能力及环境动态变化的抗扰性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

Motivation: 情境强化学习（ICRL）在适应下游任务方面显示出潜力，但在处理多模态数据和多样化任务时仍面临挑战。

Method: T2MIR框架在基于Transformer的决策模型中引入两种并行MoE层：一种是针对输入令牌的多模态语义捕获的token-wise MoE，另一种是针对任务多样性的task-wise MoE，并通过对比学习方法增强任务路由。

Result: 实验表明，T2MIR显著提升了情境学习能力，并超越了多种基线方法。

Conclusion: T2MIR展示了MoE在ICRL中的潜力，为ICRL向语言和视觉领域的成就迈进提供了简单且可扩展的架构改进。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了MCI-Diff框架，通过基于扩散模型的方法从基线sMRI数据中合成未来sMRI表示，实现了实时风险评估和高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期预测轻度认知障碍（MCI）转化面临即时性与准确性之间的权衡，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MCI-Diff框架采用多任务序列重建策略训练共享去噪网络，并引入LLM驱动的“语言指南”进行临床合理性采样。

Result: 在ADNI和AIBL数据集上的实验表明，MCI-Diff在早期转化预测准确性上优于现有方法，提升了5-12%。

Conclusion: MCI-Diff框架在保持实时性的同时，显著提高了MCI转化的预测准确性，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

*Yuxuan Yue,Zukang Xu,Zhihang Yuan,Dawei Yang,Jianglong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种极坐标解耦向量量化（PCDVQ）框架，通过独立量化向量的方向和幅值，有效提升了边缘部署中大规模语言模型的压缩精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLMs）在边缘部署中面临参数规模庞大的挑战，现有向量量化（VQ）方法在极低位宽（如2位）下精度损失较大，尤其是方向量化误差显著高于幅值。

Method: 提出PCDVQ框架，包括两个关键模块：1）极坐标解耦（PCD），将向量转换为极坐标表示并独立量化方向和幅值；2）分布对齐码本构建（DACC），根据源分布优化方向和幅值码本。

Result: 实验表明，PCDVQ在2位量化水平下比基线方法至少提升了1.5%的零样本任务准确率。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为高精度和高压缩的LLMs提供了一种新的量化范式，显著降低了边缘部署中的量化误差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper是一种高效的GRPO训练算法，通过共享前缀前向策略消除了冗余计算，提升了长上下文学习场景的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在处理长共享前缀时引入大量计算开销，成为长上下文学习场景的主要扩展瓶颈。

Method: 提出Prefix Grouper，通过将自注意力重构为两部分，使共享前缀仅编码一次，同时保持完全可微性和端到端训练的兼容性。

Result: 实验证实Prefix Grouper在显著降低训练计算成本的同时，保持了与标准GRPO一致的优化动态和最终策略性能。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper是一种即插即用的方法，兼容现有GRPO架构，无需结构修改，仅需最小化输入构建和注意力计算的调整，提升了GRPO在复杂任务和大模型中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now
available at https://github.com/johncaged/PrefixGrouper

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Lipschitz有界网络的新方法lip-rcp，用于在对抗攻击下高效且精确地估计鲁棒的Conformal Prediction集合，并在大规模场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Conformal Prediction在对抗攻击下无法保证其预测集合的有效性，且现有鲁棒方法在大规模问题中要么集合过大，要么计算成本过高，难以实际应用。

Method: 本文提出了一种新方法lip-rcp，利用Lipschitz有界网络来精确且高效地估计鲁棒的Conformal Prediction集合，并结合1-Lipschitz鲁棒网络进行优化。

Result: lip-rcp方法在中等和大规模场景（如ImageNet）中，在鲁棒CP集合的大小和计算效率方面均优于现有技术。同时，本文还推导了vanilla CP在攻击下的最坏情况覆盖边界。

Conclusion: lip-rcp方法不仅使vanilla CP在对抗攻击下保持高效，还提供了鲁棒性保证，为大规模应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效监测可重复使用包装的状态，并在保持高精度的同时实现低功耗和小模型体积，适用于实际工业应用。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的动态健康指标（HI）构建方法，通过无监督框架自动提取退化特征，并考虑HI级时间依赖性，从而更好地表示退化趋势和预测未来退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的健康指标构建方法大多依赖专家知识进行特征提取，且忽略了序列退化过程中的动态信息，限制了HI在退化趋势表示和预测中的能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种无监督框架，首先通过基于跳跃连接的自编码器将原始信号映射到代表性退化特征空间，然后在该空间中嵌入内部HI预测块的HI生成模块，构建动态HI。

Result: 在两个轴承生命周期数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的HI构建方法优于对比方法，且构建的动态HI在预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态HI构建方法能够有效捕捉退化过程的动态内容，确保其在退化趋势建模和未来退化预测中的有效性。

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Conclusion: UniPTMs框架在跨模态特征融合和性能优化方面取得了显著进展，为蛋白质翻译后修饰的精确预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中，隐藏的混淆因素可能影响状态和动作，导致策略学习偏差，产生次优或不可泛化的行为。现有算法通常忽略这一问题，仅基于统计关联学习策略。

Method: 本文提出DoSAC算法，扩展了SAC算法，通过后门调整进行因果干预估计。引入可学习的后门重构器，从当前状态推断伪过去变量，实现后门调整。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，DoSAC在混淆设置下优于基线方法，表现出更高的鲁棒性、泛化能力和策略可靠性。

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了强化学习中的隐藏混淆问题，显著提升了策略性能。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Motivation: 研究旨在理解模型规模如何影响语言模型的训练动态，特别是损失减速现象及其背后的机制。

Method: 通过分析语言模型在训练过程中损失曲线的变化，识别损失减速现象，并提出零和学习（ZSL）作为解释该现象的理论框架。

Conclusion: 损失减速和零和学习（ZSL）为理解语言模型规模定律提供了新的视角，并可能直接用于改进语言模型，而不依赖于规模扩展。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts
available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Method: 通过结合Bandit Learning和内存受限对手的理论，提出了一种方法来应对这一挑战。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种有效的方法，能够在仅查询一个启发式算法的情况下，达到与最佳启发式算法相当的性能。

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

Motivation: 传统共形预测方法依赖结构化输出（如几何距离或softmax分数），无法直接应用于生成模型（如LLMs）。研究旨在解决仅通过有限查询构建预测集时的覆盖率、查询预算和信息量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出CPQ框架，基于统计学中的缺失质量问题，设计最优查询策略（依赖缺失质量衰减率）和预测集映射（依赖缺失质量估计），并开发新型估计器（如Good Turing估计器）。

Result: 在三个开放任务和两种LLM上的实验表明：(1) 两个核心原则均对CPQ性能有独立贡献；(2) CPQ生成的预测集信息量显著优于现有语言不确定性量化方法。

Conclusion: CPQ适用于任意黑盒LLM，通过结合缺失质量问题的统计原理，在有限查询条件下实现了高覆盖率与高信息量的预测集，为生成模型的安全部署提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PDE代理模型在新初始条件下泛化能力差，且误差随时间积累。物理和对称约束有望提升性能，但现有技术与交错网格不兼容。

Method: 引入新的输入输出层，确保在交错网格上遵守物理规律和对称性，并系统研究这些约束对PDE代理模型精度的影响。

Result: 与基线相比，对称性和物理约束显著提升了模型性能，尤其在初始条件和持续时间超出训练数据范围时，双重约束模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 结合对称性和物理约束的PDE代理模型在多个任务中表现优异，且对实际洋流预测更为准确。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)
paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach
employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All
(WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained
attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous
tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting,
presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we
relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our
approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series,
demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

Conclusion: 通过大规模Sinkhorn耦合和低熵正则化，流模型的训练效率和生成质量得到了显著提升，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Motivation: 现有的谱增强图神经网络（SGNN）的表达性评估框架与图谱对齐不佳，限制了对其表达性的深入理解。

Method: 本文利用图最大特征值多重性分类图的范式，提出了SGNN的表达性层次结构，并采用旋转等变神经网络来提高SGNN的表达性。

Result: 实验验证了理论主张，通过在MNIST Superpixel数据集上的图像分类实验和ZINC图上的特征向量规范化。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效提高了SGNN在简单谱图上的表达性，为SGNN的进一步研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively
discern synthetic media from authentic content.

Motivation: 随着生物数据集的规模、多样性和异质性增加，需要自动化方法来生成可推广的预测模型。现有的大语言模型代理在处理异质计算生物学数据集时存在泛化和成功率问题。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 大语言模型尚未有效利用边缘设备上的大量数据，而联邦学习提供了一种在不将隐私数据传输到云端的情况下协作微调模型的范式。然而，现有的LoRA方法在联邦学习环境中存在精度下降的问题。

Method: Ravan方法通过将权重更新重新参数化为多个LoRA头的和，仅训练核心矩阵及其轻量级缩放因子，从而在不增加通信参数的情况下恢复更高秩的近似更新。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，Ravan比现有的参数高效基线方法提高了2-8%的测试精度。

Conclusion: Ravan是一种鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案，适用于大语言模型的联邦微调。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Motivation: 探索预训练分布中哪些条件能够促使Transformer模型在少量示例后泛化到未见过的任务，特别是在分布外泛化的情况下。

Method: 通过使用线性函数训练Transformer模型，研究任务多样性对ICL能力的影响，并构建相图来表征任务多样性与预训练任务数量的关系。

Result: 随着任务多样性增加，Transformer模型从仅在预训练任务分布内展现ICL的专用解过渡到在整个任务空间内泛化的通用解，并在非线性回归问题中观察到类似过渡。

Conclusion: 任务多样性和预训练任务数量是影响ICL能力的关键因素，模型深度和回归问题的维度也会影响这一过渡。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在子群体分布变化情况下有效保持了保形预测的覆盖性，适用于实际机器学习任务。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large

TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in

*Yash Vijay,Harini Subramanyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的时空Transformer模型FaCTR，通过显式结构设计解决时间序列预测中的过参数化问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在语言和视觉任务中表现出色，但在时间序列预测中，由于其架构复杂性和时间序列数据的低信息密度及复杂的依赖关系，导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这种不匹配和过参数化问题。

Method: FaCTR通过低秩因子分解机建模动态对称跨通道交互，并通过可学习门控机制将其注入时间上下文化补丁嵌入中。此外，它还编码了静态和动态协变量以实现多变量条件。

Result: FaCTR在11个公共预测基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，其最大变体仅使用约40万参数，比竞争性时空Transformer基线平均小50倍。

Conclusion: FaCTR的紧凑设计和结构化特性使其在时间序列任务中既高效又可解释，支持自监督预训练，为下游任务提供了多功能的基础。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

TL;DR: 最大熵强化学习（MaxEnt RL）在复杂控制任务中面临鲁棒性与最优性之间的权衡，本文通过实验分析了这种权衡如何影响其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MaxEnt RL在许多任务中表现出色，但在需要精确控制的性能关键任务中，其表现不如非MaxEnt算法。本文旨在探讨这种差异的原因。

Method: 通过在不同控制问题上进行实验，本文分析了熵最大化在探索和鲁棒性增强的同时，如何误导策略优化。

Result: 实验表明，熵最大化在需要低熵策略的任务中可能导致失败，揭示了MaxEnt RL在复杂控制任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文为在挑战性控制问题中平衡奖励设计和熵最大化提供了新的理解，有助于改进MaxEnt RL的应用。

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Motivation: 在药物发现、化学设计和生物学等领域，设计分子并保持与目标分子的相似性和/或特定属性至关重要。本文旨在提出一种高效的方法，利用生成化学语言模型（CLM）在分子空间中进行导航和采样，同时以分子相似性为指导。

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

TL;DR: AutoQD提出了一种自动生成行为描述符的方法，通过嵌入马尔可夫决策过程中的策略占用度量，利用随机傅里叶特征近似最大均值差异，从而在无需预定义行为描述符的情况下发现多样化策略。

Motivation: 现有的质量-多样性（QD）算法在发现多样化、高性能解决方案方面取得了显著成功，但严重依赖于手工设计的行为描述符，限制了探索的多样性。本文旨在通过自动生成行为描述符来克服这一限制。

Method: AutoQD利用随机傅里叶特征近似策略占用度量之间的最大均值差异（MMD），生成反映行为差异的嵌入，并通过低维投影捕获最具行为意义的维度，作为现成QD方法的行为描述符。

Result: 实验表明，AutoQD能够在多个连续控制任务中发现多样化的策略，无需预定义行为描述符，为无监督强化学习和QD优化提供了一个有理论依据的替代方法。

Conclusion: AutoQD为无领域知识的开放学习与自动行为发现提供了新的可能性，展示了其在序列决策设置中的潜力。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: 任务特定的参数映射技术能有效降低模型计算成本并提升特定任务性能。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过适应模型结构，显著提升了数据归因的准确性，为理解生成模型的输出提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this
paper are available at https://github.com/CSU-ModelCompression/BAQ.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Conclusion: 通过引入显式差异矩阵和隐式物理约束，该框架能够使GNN更好地捕捉有向图中的细节拓扑差异，从而提升其建模能力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化复杂系统（如药物发现和高性能材料设计）是一个跨学科的挑战，传统方法在训练数据外表现不佳，无法准确预测评分并生成优质设计。

Method: ManGO框架通过扩散模型学习设计-评分流形，结合无导数引导的条件生成和自适应推理时间缩放，动态优化去噪路径。

Result: ManGO在合成任务、机器人控制、材料设计、DNA序列和实际工程优化等多个领域中，优于24种单目标和10种多目标优化方法。

Conclusion: ManGO通过统一设计-评分空间，实现了超越训练数据的泛化能力，为复杂系统优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XR系统需在隐私保护前提下实现多模态、多任务智能交互。现有基础模型（FMs）虽表征能力强，但缺乏隐私保护；联邦学习（FL）虽保护隐私，但难以处理复杂多模态需求。结合二者可推动XR系统智能化发展。

Method: 提出模块化联邦基础模型架构，分析XR系统在SHIFT五个维度（传感器多样性、硬件异构性、交互个性化、任务可变性、环境动态性）的挑战，并通过应用案例验证，提出评估指标与数据集要求。

Result: 构建了FedFMs在XR中的技术框架，明确了SHIFT维度对模型设计的影响，提出资源感知的模型开发权衡方案，为隐私保护的上下文感知智能奠定基础。

Conclusion: 通过整合联邦学习与多模态基础模型，结合SHIFT维度分析，为下一代XR系统提供了兼顾隐私保护、多任务适应性和资源效率的智能化技术路径。

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated
foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems
through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated
learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails
different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

TL;DR: 本文主张临床AI的部署后监测不足，并提出基于统计有效性和标签效率的测试框架，以确保实际部署中的可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA注册的AI医疗工具中，仅9%包含部署后监测计划，现有方法多为手动、零散和被动，难以适应临床模型的动态环境。

Method: 提出基于统计有效性和标签效率的测试框架，将数据变化和模型性能下降检测视为独立的统计假设检验问题。

Result: 通过统计严谨性确保临床AI系统的可靠性，并为技术社区开辟新的研究方向。

Conclusion: 部署后监测应基于统计有效性和标签效率的测试框架，以确保临床AI系统在实际环境中的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Motivation: 现有的连续学习方法通常假设智能体在动态环境中的能力保持不变，这与现实世界中能力动态变化的场景不符。因此，本文提出了动态能力下的连续学习问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在跨动作空间的策略泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的AACL框架有效解决了动态能力下的连续学习问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于生成式人工智能的语义通信框架为未来6G系统中的鲁棒语义传输提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CoTo的渐进式训练策略，通过逐步增加适配器的激活概率，解决了LoRA在微调过程中容易陷入次优解的问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和下游操作的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩适应（LoRA）是一种高效的参数微调技术，但在微调过程中，适配器容易陷入初始值附近的次优解，限制了模型的泛化能力和下游操作（如适配器合并和剪枝）的效果。

Method: 本文提出了CoTo策略，通过在微调过程中逐步增加适配器的激活概率，并随机停用适配器，以促进更平衡的优化和更广泛的损失空间探索。

Result: 实验表明，CoTo在单任务性能、多任务合并精度、剪枝鲁棒性和训练开销方面均有显著提升，并且与多种LoRA变体兼容。

Conclusion: CoTo通过渐进式训练策略有效解决了LoRA在微调中的次优解问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和下游操作的效率，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Conclusion: 本文提出的损失函数在不增加参数或计算复杂度的情况下，显著提升了多标签分类的性能，特别是在处理大量负实例的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Motivation: 现实世界的数据流具有固有的非平稳性，表现为概念漂移，这对自适应学习系统提出了重大挑战。现有方法通常只处理孤立的分布变化，而忽略了在有限监督和持续不确定性下标签空间和分布的协同演化。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放世界流数据场景中的语义和分布演化提供了一个统一的稳定适应框架，解决了现有方法在处理标签空间和分布协同演化时的不足。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLHF流程中，奖励模型训练成本高昂，通常需要数百亿参数和离线偏好调优阶段。本文旨在通过简化模型结构，降低训练成本，同时保持高精度。

Method: 使用冻结的7B指令调优LLM，结合单行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器（仅影响0.8%的参数），替代传统的高参数奖励模型。

Result: 该方法在RewardBench上达到96.2%的准确率，优于27B至70B参数的专用奖励网络；7B模型在GSM-8K上通过在线PPO实现了92%的准确率，优于70B的DPO基线（61.8%）。

Conclusion: 结合提示工程和小型LoRA适配器的低成本方法，有效替代了传统高成本奖励模型，实现了新的SOTA结果，且无需离线阶段，具有高透明性和易调整性。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

*Yang Li,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流匹配模型的新型模仿学习框架flowOE，用于优化动态金融市场中的大额资产交易策略，通过模仿和提升专家策略，显著提高了收益并降低了风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态最优执行策略在动态金融市场中表现不佳，难以平衡市场冲击成本和时机或波动风险，因此需要一种更适应市场变化的策略。

Method: 本文提出了flowOE框架，结合流匹配模型和模仿学习，通过学习多种专家策略并自适应选择最合适的行为，同时在模仿过程中引入精炼损失函数，以提升专家策略的效果。

Result: 在不同市场条件下的实证评估表明，flowOE显著优于经过专门校准的专家模型和其他传统基准，实现了更高的收益和更低的风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了其在增强自适应最优执行方面的实际应用潜力和优势，为金融市场的交易策略提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为双向轨迹扩散（BiTrajDiff）的新数据增强框架，用于离线强化学习，通过同时建模未来和历史轨迹来提升数据多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习中的数据增强技术仅关注从给定状态重建未来轨迹，而忽略了到达这些状态的历史转移，这限制了行为模式的多样性和关键状态的发现。

Method: BiTrajDiff框架将轨迹生成任务分解为两个独立但互补的扩散过程：一个生成前向轨迹以预测未来动态，另一个生成后向轨迹以追踪关键历史转移。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，BiTrajDiff相比其他先进的数据增强方法，在各种离线强化学习骨干模型上均表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff通过双向轨迹扩散有效提升了数据多样性，并在离线强化学习中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证在加密货币价格预测中，增加神经网络复杂性是否真的能提升短期价格预测能力，还是主要依赖于数据预处理和特征工程。

Method: 使用从简单基线模型（如逻辑回归、XGBoost）到复杂深度架构（如DeepLOB、Conv1D+LSTM）的多种模型，基于BTC/USDT的限价订单簿数据进行实验，并引入了两种数据过滤管道（卡尔曼滤波、Savitzky-Golay滤波）。

Result: 结果表明，经过数据预处理和超参数调整后，简单模型的表现可以匹配甚至超越复杂神经网络，且在推理速度和可解释性上更具优势。

Conclusion: 在加密货币价格预测中，复杂神经网络并不总是最优选择，简单模型在适当的数据处理和调优下，能够提供更高效和可解释的预测结果。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法主要基于已知配体结合口袋的holo蛋白结构，但在缺乏口袋信息的apo或预测结构上表现显著下降。本文旨在解决这一问题，推动早期药物发现。

Method: 提出了一种对齐与聚合框架，包含三模态对比学习模块和跨注意力适配器，分别用于增强对口袋定位误差的鲁棒性，并在缺乏精确口袋注释的情况下从活性数据中学习。

Result: 在apo结构的新基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法，早期富集因子（EF1%）从11.75提升至37.19，并在holo结构上保持了强劲表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析的蛋白-配体复合物场景下具有显著优势，有望推动首创新药的发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Motivation: 理解神经网络中单个单元的功能是机制解释性的重要基础，但现有解释方法缺乏统一的评估标准。

Method: 作者将现有解释评估方法统一到一个数学框架下，并提出了两个简单的检查方法来验证评估指标的可靠性。

Result: 实验和理论结果表明，许多常用评估指标在概念标签发生巨大变化时未能改变其评分，因此不可靠。

Conclusion: 本文提出了未来评估应遵循的指导原则，并确定了一组可靠的评估指标。

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化优化中，减少通信复杂度是关键。现有的近端去中心化优化（PDO）方法在解决子问题时需要高精度，导致计算开销大。

Method: 本文提出了稳定近端去中心化优化方法（SPDO），通过放松子问题的精度要求并利用节点间的平均函数相似性来改进现有PDO方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPDO在通信和计算复杂度方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPDO方法在去中心化优化框架中实现了最先进的通信和计算复杂度，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: EqCollide通过等变结构与神经场融合，解决了可变形物体碰撞模拟的关键挑战，为复杂物理系统建模提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

Conclusion: 序数神经坍缩（ONC）在深度序数回归任务中确实存在，并且可以通过固定阈值来利用这些特性进行应用。

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消息传递图神经网络（GNNs）在处理图结构信息时存在局限，特别是对连通性和环等关键信息的利用不足。位置编码（PE）和持久同调（PH）被认为是解决这一问题的两种有前景的方法，但缺乏对它们优缺点的理论分析。

Conclusion: PiPE作为一种新的学习方法，成功结合了PE和PH的优点，显著提升了图表示学习的能力，推动了该领域的前沿发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Conclusion: WDAN有效解决了非平稳时间序列预测中的挑战，并提升了模型的预测性能。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available
at: https://github.com/adrienpetralia/CamAL. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一离散决策过程和连续车辆动力学，全面表征了驾驶员间和驾驶员内的异质性，为跟车建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在减少对大数据依赖方面取得了显著进展，但在处理复杂问题时，其精度仍有待提高。

Method: 引入Over-PINNs框架，利用自动微分生成高阶辅助方程，作为额外的损失项纳入训练过程，通过“超定”方法增强模型对物理信息的捕捉能力。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在解决多种PDE问题时展现出强大的通用性，显著提高了求解精度，且未显著增加计算成本。

Conclusion: Over-PINNs框架通过引入高阶辅助方程，有效提升了PINNs的精度，为解决复杂PDE问题提供了一种高效的方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Conclusion: 基于机器学习的替代模型能够显著减少大规模交通分配问题的计算负担，XGBoost是其中的最佳选择。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，深度学习模型的可靠性至关重要，特别是面对分布外（OOD）和对抗性输入时，Evidential Deep Learning (EDL)容易产生过度自信的错误。

Method: C-EDL是一种轻量级的事后不确定性量化方法，通过生成多样化的任务保留转换并量化表示分歧，来校准不确定性估计。

Result: C-EDL在多种数据集、攻击类型和不确定性指标上显著优于现有EDL变体，OOD数据的覆盖率降低了55%，对抗性数据的覆盖率降低了90%。

Conclusion: C-EDL在不重新训练的情况下，显著提升了对抗性和OOD输入的检测能力，同时保持了高分布内准确性和低计算开销。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,

the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于码本的加法向量量化方法，用于压缩扩散模型，显著降低了硬件资源需求，并在低比特权重量化方面取得了新的帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成多样化媒体方面表现出色，但其大规模市场应用受限于高硬件资源需求。现有的均匀标量量化方法虽有所缓解，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 本文采用基于码本的加法向量量化方法，将多个相关权重作为压缩的基本单位，应用于扩散模型压缩。

Result: 在LDM-4模型上，本文方法在极低比特权重量化方面取得了新的帕累托前沿，W4A8下sFID比全精度模型低1.92点，W2A8下FID、sFID和ISC均取得最佳结果，并在任意硬件上实现了FLOPs节省。

Conclusion: 基于码本的加法向量量化方法有效降低了扩散模型的硬件资源需求，推动了其大规模市场应用。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Motivation: 连续动作空间的强化学习算法通常仅依赖策略更新进行改进，导致样本效率较低。本文旨在通过引入Bellman最优算子来加速学习，并解决可能导致的过估计偏差问题。

Method: 提出了一种退火方法，逐步从Bellman最优算子过渡到Bellman算子，结合TD3和SAC算法，以加速学习并减少过估计偏差。

Result: 在多种运动和操作任务中，该方法显著优于现有方法，表现出更高的性能和超参数鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在Actor-Critic框架中引入Bellman最优算子并通过退火方法进行优化，能够有效加速学习并减少偏差，提升算法性能。

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Motivation: 现有联邦微调方法在处理分布式环境中的灾难性遗忘问题时表现不佳，且无法有效应对数据分布和设备能力的异质性。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FedBE框架结合自适应Transformer块扩展机制和动态可训练块分配策略，扩展模型架构中的可训练块，并根据客户端的数据分布和计算能力动态分配这些块。

Result: 实验表明，FedBE在一般任务上的准确率保留率提高了12-74%，模型收敛速度加快了1.9-3.1倍，且不影响下游任务的准确性。

Conclusion: FedBE框架有效解决了联邦微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型在异构环境中的泛化能力，具有显著的优势。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Result: AMPED在多个基准测试中超越了现有的SBRL基线方法。

Conclusion: AMPED展示了显式协调探索与多样性的重要性，实现了鲁棒且可泛化的技能学习。

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DMPEL的动态混合渐进参数高效专家库方法，用于终身机器人学习，通过动态组合专家库中的专家来构建端到端策略，有效解决了终身学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的预训练-微调范式在单任务适应中表现良好，但在终身学习场景下，现有方法依赖于不切实际的任务标识假设，并且限制了知识在独立适配器之间的共享。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了DMPEL方法。

Method: DMPEL方法通过逐步学习一个低秩专家库，并利用轻量级路由器动态组合专家，形成端到端策略。此外，通过利用微调参数的模块化结构，引入系数回放机制，指导路由器准确检索已遇到任务的冻结专家，从而减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DMPEL方法在终身学习任务中表现出色，不仅提高了成功率，还显著降低了存储和计算成本，为终身机器人学习提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RETENTION的端到端框架，通过剪枝算法和树映射方案，显著减少了树基模型推理中内容可寻址内存（CAM）的容量需求，提升了空间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在处理非结构化数据方面表现出色，但现代树基集成模型在处理结构化数据时仍具优势。然而，树基模型的加速面临固有挑战，现有基于CAM的设计存在内存消耗大和利用率低的问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种针对bagging基模型（如随机森林）的迭代剪枝算法，并结合两种创新的数据放置策略，减少了CAM中“无关”状态导致的内存冗余。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用树映射方案即可实现1.46倍到21.30倍的空间效率提升，而完整的RETENTION框架则实现了4.35倍到207.12倍的提升，且精度损失低于3%。

Conclusion: RETENTION框架在减少CAM容量需求方面非常有效，为树基模型加速提供了一种资源高效的方向。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Conclusion: LaDEEP模型在弹塑性固体大变形问题中表现出色，显著提升了计算效率和精度，并成功应用于实际工业生产。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 小语言模型在表格推理任务中表现受限，本文旨在缩小其与大语言模型之间的差距。

Method: Table-r1方法分为两个阶段：第一阶段通过自监督学习任务提高表格布局泛化能力；第二阶段采用混合范式增强推理一致性，并在需要时动态回退到文本推理。

Result: 在四个表格推理基准测试中，Table-r1在所有小语言模型方法中表现最佳，准确率比基础模型（LLaMA-8B）提高了至少15%，并与大语言模型竞争。

Conclusion: Table-r1方法显著提升了小语言模型在表格推理任务中的性能，缩小了与大语言模型的差距。

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Conclusion: 成员推理测试在语义放宽后仍易受数据污染攻击影响，需重新评估其实际可靠性并考虑对抗性防御机制。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）与用户的反馈循环可能强化现有信念，导致多样性丧失和错误信念的固化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs与用户之间的反馈循环是否会导致现有信念的固化和多样性的丧失。

Method: 通过基于代理的LLM模拟和真实世界的GPT使用数据进行实证测试。

Result: 分析显示，新GPT版本发布后，多样性出现突然但持续的下降，与假设的反馈循环一致。

Conclusion: LLMs与用户的反馈循环可能导致现有信念的固化和多样性的丧失，形成类似回音室的效果。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预训练网络（PFNs）的方法，用于在不知道因果图的情况下准确估计因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果效应估计方法通常需要干预数据或因果图知识，限制了其在实际中的应用。本文旨在探索预训练网络在因果效应估计中的潜力。

Method: 作者在多种因果结构生成的合成数据上预训练PFNs，利用这些数据预测干预结果，并通过大量实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文证明了预训练网络在因果效应估计中的有效性，为无需因果图知识的因果推断提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型因固定的左到右生成方式导致错误累积，需改进生成机制以缓解此问题。

Method: RPT方法在生成过程中动态重采样先前窗口内的token，保留原有模型预测质量与速度。

Result: 对8B参数模型进行100B数据微调后，在推理和编码基准上实现约10%相对性能提升。

Conclusion: RPT通过轻量级修改有效降低错误传播，验证了动态修正机制在自回归模型中的可行性。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于滚动扩散和分层图神经网络的物理模拟器ROBIN，通过并行化扩散推理与多尺度消息传递机制，解决了传统图学习模拟器在全局现象捕捉及长期误差累积方面的局限性，显著提升了模拟精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的物理模拟器依赖局部消息传递和直接单步预测，难以捕捉弯曲、长程关联等全局现象，且在长期推演中误差累积导致性能下降。

Method: 结合两种创新技术：(1) 滚动扩散：通过时间窗口重叠去噪步骤实现并行化扩散推理；(2) 基于代数多重网格的分层图神经网络架构，利用代数分层消息传递网络实现多尺度动力学建模。

Result: 在包含几何/材料/接触非线性的2D/3D固体力学基准测试中，ROBIN在精度指标上达到SOTA，推理速度比标准扩散模拟器快一个数量级。

Conclusion: ROBIN通过融合时间并行化扩散与多分辨率建模，有效平衡局部细节和全局效应，为复杂物理系统的高效高精度模拟提供了新范式。

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性估计方法（如dropout）难以清晰区分可靠与不可靠的预测，主要由于分类器权重噪声的影响。

Method: 提出一种测试时优化方法，通过考虑分类器权重噪声，生成单调子集选择函数，提升置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 该方法在AUSE和AURC等风险指标上表现优异，能有效识别训练与测试分布的差异，并区分分布内与分布外样本。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测的可靠性，还揭示了CNN与ViT分类器在不同视觉数据集上的关键差异。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Motivation: 现有的机器去学习算法在面对能够恢复所有数据的最坏情况攻击者时，难以高效更新模型。本文提出了一种更现实的系统感知攻击者模型，以减少存储需求并提高效率。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于选择性采样的系统感知去学习算法，适用于线性分类，并将其推广到一般函数类分类。

Conclusion: 系统感知去学习提供了一种更现实且高效的去学习方法，能够在保持模型准确性的同时，减少存储需求和计算时间。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为STOF的框架，通过灵活掩码和操作符融合优化稀疏Transformer在GPU上的性能，显著提升了计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏Transformer的性能优化未被充分研究，且基于规则的机制无法适应不同序列长度和混合操作符的融合机会。

Method: STOF框架通过统一多头注意力的存储格式和内核实现，将融合方案映射到编译模板，并通过两阶段搜索引擎确定最佳参数设置。

Result: 实验结果显示，STOF在多头注意力计算和端到端推理中分别实现了1.7倍和1.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: STOF框架有效提升了稀疏Transformer在GPU上的性能，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基础模型任务适配需反复微调，存在训练成本高、超参数敏感等问题，亟需更高效的轻量化解决方案。

Method: 训练超网络T2L，单次前向传播即可生成任务特定LoRA适配器，基于9个预训练LoRA（如GSM8K、Arc）构建训练集。

Result: 重构的LoRA性能匹配原任务适配器，可压缩数百个实例并零样本泛化至新任务，代码已开源。

Conclusion: T2L为语言模型轻量化适配提供新范式，通过自然语言接口实现低计算需求的民主化模型定制。

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IAM的框架，用于量化样本级别的机器学习模型遗忘效果，解决了现有方法在计算资源消耗和细粒度变化捕捉上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和安全问题的日益突出，机器学习模型中的遗忘特定数据影响（即机器遗忘）变得尤为重要。然而，现有的评估方法如成员推理攻击（MIAs）在计算资源消耗和细粒度变化捕捉上存在局限性。

Method: 本文提出了Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM)框架，通过插值模型在查询样本上的泛化-拟合行为差距来量化样本级别的遗忘完整性。

Result: IAM在精确遗忘的二元包含测试中表现优异，并且在近似遗忘中显示出高相关性，仅使用一个预训练的阴影模型即可扩展到大型语言模型（LLMs）。

Conclusion: IAM框架有效地解决了现有机器遗忘评估方法的局限性，揭示了近似遗忘算法中普遍存在的过度遗忘和欠遗忘风险，强调了需要更强的安全保护措施。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering
performance in high-dimensional data, where irrelevant features can obscure
meaningful structure. In this work, we introduce the Minkowski weighted
$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and
informative features, and SFS-MWK++, a scalable variant based on subsampling.
We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and
extensive experiments showing that our methods consistently outperform existing
alternatives.

Conclusion: 流注意力通过引入守恒定律约束，增强了GNN在物理流图数据中的建模能力，验证了其在复杂图结构任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Motivation: 多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，不同任务的梯度可能相互冲突，阻碍损失函数的收敛。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了相似性感知动量梯度手术（SAM-GS），通过梯度均衡和一阶动量的调制来处理梯度冲突。

Conclusion: 梯度幅值相似性在多任务深度学习的梯度聚合中起关键作用，SAM-GS为优化学习过程提供了有效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Motivation: 自注意力机制已成为现代神经网络的核心组件，但其理论基础尚不明确。本文旨在通过研究交互实体，揭示自注意力机制在训练中如何学习交互函数，并验证其泛化能力。

Method: 本文通过分析自注意力机制在训练中的表现，提出单层线性自注意力能有效表示成对交互。基于此，提出新模块HyperFeatureAttention和HyperAttention，分别用于学习特征级交互和多实体依赖。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了自注意力机制作为交互学习器的理论基础，并提出新模块以捕捉更复杂的交互模式，为自注意力机制在多种现实场景中的应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的对偶初始噪声框架具有训练无关、模型普适、零计算开销的优势，为扩散模型的多样性和统计估计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络（PINC）的偏微分方程（PDE）建模与控制框架，通过两阶段网络结构（稳态与瞬态）结合物理守恒定律，无需标记数据即可实现单相流系统的动态响应建模与实时模型预测控制（MPC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于PDE的单相流系统建模与控制方法在瞬态条件下面临挑战，尤其是依赖标记数据与迭代求解器的计算效率问题。本文旨在扩展PINC框架（原用于ODE）至PDE场景，解决无标签数据下的流体动态建模与实时控制难题。

Method: 1. 构建两阶段网络：稳态网络学习控制输入下的平衡解，瞬态网络捕捉时变边界条件的动态响应；2. 提出简化假设降低初始条件的空间维度，提升训练效率；3. 结合物理守恒定律训练网络，并基于MPC推导最优控制策略。

Result: 数值实验表明，PINC模型仅通过物理定律训练即可准确表征流动动态，支持实时控制，且无需迭代求解器即可高效近似PDE解，验证了其在流体监测与优化中的潜力。

Conclusion: PINC框架为工程中的流体流动建模与控制提供了无标签数据依赖、计算高效的替代方案，其两阶段结构与简化假设显著提升了PDE控制的可行性与实时性。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Motivation: 现有守恒定律研究主要集中于浅层ReLU/线性网络，而对实际应用广泛的现代架构（如ResNet、Transformer）缺乏系统性分析。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过数学推导分析各模块（ReLU层、注意力层、残差块）的守恒定律，提出参数子集相关守恒概念，并验证其在连续梯度流与离散SGD动态中的一致性。

Result: 发现注意力层/残差块与浅层网络具有相同守恒定律，证明模块化分析的有效性，且守恒原则在SGD优化中仍保持近似成立。

Conclusion: 现代架构的守恒特性可通过模块化分解进行系统性研究，这为理解复杂网络训练动态提供了新理论框架，并暗示优化策略设计方向。

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了基于深度强化学习的通用型尾流控制策略，为动态风场优化提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法通常依赖手工设计或启发式的数据增强策略，这些策略未能充分考虑数据的底层分布，并且在单个图层面操作，忽视了从同一模型生成的图之间的相似性。

Method: MGCL首先估计与观测数据相关的图模型（graphon），然后定义一个基于图模型的数据增强过程，实现数据自适应和原则性的增强。对于图级任务，MGCL对数据集进行聚类并为每组估计一个图模型，使对比对能够反映共享的语义和结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MGCL实现了最先进的性能，证明了将生成模型引入图对比学习的优势。

Conclusion: MGCL通过结合图模型，提供了一种数据自适应且原则性的图对比学习框架，显著提升了图表示学习的效果。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出广义拉格朗日均衡传播（GLEP），将均衡传播（EP）算法扩展至时变输入场景，并通过边界条件分析推导出哈密顿回声学习（HEL）作为其实例。HEL继承了EP的硬件友好特性，如仅需前向传播、高效扩展和局部学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均衡传播（EP）算法仅适用于静态输入，而将其扩展至时变输入时面临轨迹整体变分描述和边界条件处理的挑战。本文旨在解决这一局限性，探索适用于动态输入的变分学习框架。

Method: 提出广义拉格朗日均衡传播（GLEP），通过变分原理将EP推广至时变系统轨迹。通过分析不同边界条件对学习算法的影响，证明HEL（包括RHEL和HEB）是GLEP在特定边界条件下的特例。

Result: HEL是GLEP中唯一满足硬件实现需求的实例：仅需前向传播（推理与学习共享同一系统）、计算效率高（仅需两次或多次前向传播）且支持局部学习。其他GLEP变体因边界条件限制而缺乏实用性。

Conclusion: GLEP为时变输入的变分学习提供了统一框架，并将HEL纳入其理论体系。HEL的硬件友好特性使其成为替代反向传播的可行方案，为基于物理系统的机器学习硬件实现提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

TL;DR: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不够鲁棒，容易被微调逆转。本文提出了一种名为UNDO的可扩展方法，通过蒸馏来增强遗忘的鲁棒性，并在计算成本和鲁棒性之间建立了新的帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型遗忘方法不够鲁棒，容易被微调逆转，即使是通过模仿未接触过不需要信息的理想化模型进行训练也是如此。这表明基于输出的微调不足以实现鲁棒的遗忘。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO)的方法，该方法将遗忘模型蒸馏到其部分噪声副本中，引入了计算成本和鲁棒性之间的可调权衡。

Result: 在最强设置下，UNDO在仅使用60-80%的计算资源和仅需要0.01%的预训练数据标记的情况下，匹配了从头开始训练模型的鲁棒性。在更现实的WMDP基准测试中，UNDO也表现出鲁棒的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 由于蒸馏在实践中被广泛使用，在遗忘步骤之前加入蒸馏提供了一种便捷的路径来实现鲁棒的能力移除。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Motivation: 现有基于权重矩阵特征谱分析的方法中，矩阵长宽比会显著影响重尾性度量结果，导致模型诊断和分层超参数分配不准确。需要消除这种尺寸偏差以提高分析可靠性。

Method: 提出FARMS方法：对权重矩阵进行固定长宽比的子矩阵采样，通过计算子矩阵平均经验谱密度(ESD)的重尾性指标，替代原始矩阵的ESD分析，从而消除长宽比偏差。

Result: 在计算机视觉模型、科学机器学习训练和LLM剪枝等场景中验证有效性。其中LLaMA-7B剪枝实验显示，FARMS将困惑度降低17.3%，优于现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: FARMS通过简单的固定长宽比采样策略，有效解决了特征谱分析中的尺寸偏差问题，为跨领域深度神经网络分析提供了更可靠的诊断工具和超参数优化基础。

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Method: 提出了一种学习框架，集成了基于动态奖励调整和课程学习的策略，采用非对称的actor-critic架构加速训练，并通过噪声注入增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在两种四足平台上，恢复成功率分别达到了99.1%和97.8%，同时通过轮腿协同机制减少了关节扭矩消耗，提升了稳定性和能效。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了轮腿机器人跌倒后的恢复能力，展示了轮腿协同在减少能量消耗和提升稳定性方面的优势。

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提高了零样本目标导航的性能，特别是在长距离场景中的路径效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出BEAST，一种基于B样条的动作序列标记器，无需单独训练即可生成紧凑的离散/连续标记，支持并行解码生成平滑轨迹，显著降低计算成本并在多任务中保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于向量量化或字节对编码的动作标记器需单独训练标记器，生成非均匀长度标记且存在轨迹不连续问题。BEAST旨在解决这些限制，提升动作生成的效率与质量。

Method: 通过B样条编码将动作序列转换为统一长度的离散/连续标记，无需训练标记器；结合变分自编码器（连续标记）、仅解码器Transformer（离散标记）及预训练视觉语言模型Florence-2验证兼容性。

Result: 在166个模拟任务和8个真实任务中，BEAST降低训练/推理计算成本，生成高频平滑控制信号，任务成功率与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: BEAST通过B样条编码实现高效、平滑的动作生成，兼容性强且可扩展至大型预训练模型，为连续控制任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of

these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights

Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Conclusion: FPDANet通过结合位置依赖建模与多尺度特征融合，显著提升了胎儿超声图像分类性能，为低质量医学图像分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

*Nadine Garibli,Mayank Patwari,Bence Csiba,Yi Wei,Kostas Sidiropoulos*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出自动化方法LinGuinE，用于肺部肿瘤纵向CT扫描的自动分割，通过刚性配准和有效性分类器提升分割精度，实验显示Dice系数显著提高20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在纵向研究中缺乏自动化肿瘤分割方案，而肿瘤体积追踪对放疗、手术及化疗效果评估至关重要。

Method: 基于医生提供的初始肿瘤位置，通过刚性配准将采样点传播至其他时间点，利用有效性分类器筛选点并生成新时间点的自动分割。

Result: 在临床和公开数据集上，Dice系数提升超20%（p<0.05），消融实验验证了方法有效性，且支持任意时间点作为起始点。

Conclusion: LinGuinE显著优化了纵向肿瘤分割的自动化水平，具有高精度和灵活性，适用于不同临床场景。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出Gen4D全流程自动化生成多样化、逼真的4D人体动画，并构建大规模合成数据集SportPAL，以解决真实场景数据不足导致计算机视觉任务性能低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实场景活动数据（尤其是体育领域）的匮乏导致计算机视觉任务性能受限，而现有合成数据集因依赖固定资源库和手工渲染流程，存在人体外观、动作及场景多样性不足的缺陷。

Method: Gen4D整合专家驱动运动编码、基于扩散高斯溅射的提示引导虚拟人生成技术，以及人体感知背景合成技术，实现全自动生成高多样性4D人体动画。

Result: 基于Gen4D构建的SportPAL数据集覆盖棒球、冰球和足球三大运动场景，为野外人体中心视觉任务提供可扩展的合成数据基础。

Conclusion: Gen4D与SportPAL无需人工3D建模即可构建高度逼真、多样化的合成数据集，为数据稀缺领域提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality 3D environments is crucial for industries such
as gaming, virtual reality, and cinema, yet remains resource-intensive due to
the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their
characteristics, strengths, limitations, and potential for improvement. By
examining state-of-the-art approaches, it presents key challenges such as scene
authenticity and the influence of textual inputs. Special attention is given to
how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ODE-GS是一种新方法，结合3D高斯泼溅和潜在神经常微分方程（ODEs），用于预测超出训练时间范围的动态3D场景，实现了最先进的推断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经渲染系统在时间直接嵌入变形网络时，擅长插值但在预测未来时表现不佳，因为时间戳严格超出分布。ODE-GS旨在消除这种依赖性，实现更长时间的预测。

Method: ODE-GS首先学习一个高保真的时间条件变形模型，然后冻结该模型并训练一个Transformer编码器，将过去的高斯轨迹总结为潜在状态，其连续演化由神经ODE控制。通过数值积分生成平滑的物理合理的高斯轨迹，并实时渲染。

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，ODE-GS实现了最先进的推断性能，PSNR提高了高达10 dB，感知误差（LPIPS）减少了50%。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动态是预测复杂3D场景的强有力且实用的途径，ODE-GS展示了其在光真实感预测中的潜力。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DART-Vetter的深度学习模型，用于区分凌日调查中的行星候选者与假阳性信号。该模型基于卷积神经网络，结构简单且易于复制，展示了在TESS和Kepler数据集上的高效筛查能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着凌日调查数据的不断增长，深度学习模型在处理光变曲线数据时显得尤为重要。为了提高模型的鲁棒性，需要利用来自不同调查（如Kepler、TESS和未来的PLATO任务）数据的互补性。

Method: DART-Vetter是一种卷积神经网络，仅处理基于信号周期折叠的光变曲线。其结构相对于其他筛查模型更为简单紧凑，并在公开的TESS和Kepler数据集上进行了训练和测试。

Result: DART-Vetter在TESS和Kepler数据集上表现出色，召回率达到91%，性能优于Exominer和Astronet-Triage。其结构紧凑且开源，适用于自动化筛查或辅助人工审查。

Conclusion: DART-Vetter是一种高效的行星候选者筛查工具，展示了在特定条件下的良好泛化能力，为未来的凌日调查数据自动化处理提供了有力支持。

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯归一化流的方法，用于量化和边缘化模拟中的不确定性，并展示了其在引力波观测中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑双星合并（CBC）的种群合成模拟在从引力波（GW）观测中提取天体物理信息中起关键作用，但现实模拟成本高昂。归一化流可以模拟双星参数分布，但预测中存在不确定性。

Method: 本文开发了一种基于贝叶斯归一化流的方法，通过贝叶斯神经网络构建条件密度估计器，并利用精确的似然函数对流的后验分布进行采样，从而量化和边缘化流的不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟通过共同包层演化形成的双黑洞种群中展示了其准确性、校准和数据放大的效果，并量化了流的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在基于模拟的引力波观测推断中具有广泛应用，并可用于其他天体物理模拟研究。

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

*Jarek Duda*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 提出一种基于指数移动平均（EMA）的非参数移动估计方法，用于自适应估计非平稳时间序列（如金融数据）的参数，特别是α稳定分布的动态演化，以评估市场稳定性及极端事件风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ARMA-ARCH模型依赖预设的依赖类型，可能引入偏差。针对非平稳时间序列（如金融数据），需更灵活的方法自适应估计参数，尤其是尾部风险相关的α稳定分布参数。

Method: 采用指数加权局部对数似然函数（权重随历史数据衰减），通过EMA迭代更新参数（如中心矩m_p），并扩展至α稳定分布的动态估计，包括中心μ、尺度σ和尾部参数α。

Result: 在道琼斯指数数据中，成功估计μ、σ和α的时变演化，α参数可反映市场稳定性（尾部衰减速率），从而量化极端事件概率。

Conclusion: 移动估计方法通过EMA实现参数自适应更新，适用于α稳定分布等复杂模型，为金融时间序列的实时风险评估提供了无偏且灵活的工具。

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

TL;DR: 本文提出ScaleRTL，首个针对RTL编码的推理大语言模型，通过构建高质量长链推理数据集及测试时自校正策略，显著提升RTL生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在RTL代码生成中存在数据稀缺瓶颈，且传统微调方法无法突破数据限制及测试时扩展能力不足。

Method: 1. 构建含3.5B tokens的长链思维追踪数据集；2. 微调通用推理模型获得ScaleRTL；3. 提出测试时迭代自校正策略扩展推理深度。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准上分别以18.4%和12.7%优势超越18个基线模型，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ScaleRTL通过数据与计算双重扩展机制，验证了推理增强方法对RTL生成任务的有效性，突破传统数据瓶颈。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Motivation: 随着AI模型与物理设备的结合（如自动驾驶、医疗设备和机器人）日益普及，确保这些系统在复杂环境中的安全性成为一大挑战。由于系统故障的罕见性和极端情况的复杂性，传统的确定性安全验证方法难以实现大规模部署。

Method: 本文引入了可证明的概率安全概念，通过建立系统整体性能的概率安全边界，利用统计方法增强可行性和可扩展性，而非试图在所有极端情况下进行详尽的安全验证。

Result: 该方法为大规模部署的AI系统提供了可证明的概率安全边界，允许在部署过程中持续优化安全保证，从而在安全关键应用中实现更安全的AI系统。

Conclusion: 本文通过填补理论安全保证与实际部署之间的差距，为安全关键领域的大规模AI系统应用提供了一条可行的路径。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Conclusion: 仅使用文本进行微调的策略在低资源环境下的语音识别领域适应中具有潜力，能够有效避免灾难性遗忘，并提升模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用ALLMs的能力来评估语音生成模型在情感、音量、语速、词汇强调、音调控制和非语言元素等方面的表现。

Method: 使用四种语音生成模型（SLMs）完成两项任务（语音风格指令跟随和角色扮演），并分别由人类和两种ALLMs（GPT-4o-audio和Gemini-2.5-pro）进行评判。

Result: Gemini与人类评判员的一致性接近人类评判员之间的一致性，表明ALLMs可以作为评估SLMs的有效工具。同时，当前SLMs在控制演讲风格和生成自然对话方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ALLMs能够作为评判员有效评估语音生成模型的表现，但现有模型在演讲风格控制和对话生成方面仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two

show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking

*Yun-Shao Tsai,Yi-Cheng Lin,Huang-Cheng Chou,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: CO-VADA提出了一种无需修改模型结构或依赖人口统计信息的语音增强去偏方法，通过识别有偏样本并生成语音变体，提升语音情感识别系统的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音情感识别系统因说话者特征与情感标签的虚假关联存在偏见，且传统去偏方法需调整模型或依赖人口标注，实用性受限。

Method: CO-VADA通过置信度筛选有偏训练样本，利用语音转换技术改变无关属性生成新样本，增加说话者多样性，迫使模型关注情感相关特征。

Result: 该方法兼容多种模型与语音转换工具，通过数据增强打破训练数据中的主导偏见模式，有效提升跨人口群体的预测公平性。

Conclusion: CO-VADA为语音情感识别提供了一种灵活、可扩展的去偏方案，无需模型结构调整或人口信息，显著提升系统公平性。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用量子超网络优化二值神经网络（BiNNs）的新方法，通过变分量子算法生成二值权重，并与贝叶斯推断建立联系，实验结果表明该方法优于传统的最大似然估计。


<details>

Motivation: 二值神经网络（BiNNs）在减少内存使用和功耗方面具有潜力，但传统训练算法存在局限，量子超网络提供了一种新的优化范式，利用量子计算提升BiNNs的训练效果。

Method: 采用变分量子算法通过量子电路测量生成二值权重，并利用量子叠加和纠缠现象探索更广泛的解空间。推导了证据下界（ELBO）并引入基于最大均值差异（MMD）的替代ELBO，适用于隐式分布场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在可训练性和泛化能力上优于标准的最大似然估计（MLE）。

Conclusion: 量子超网络为优化二值神经网络提供了有效途径，能够提升其性能，特别是在处理复杂和大规模系统时具有显著优势。

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出一种部分监督神经网络（PSNN），通过直接嵌入数学结构，以更少数据在求解多参数二次优化问题时，比传统深度NN和商业求解器更优更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在解决多参数二次优化问题（mp-QP）时，即使使用大量训练数据，仍无法保证预测的最优性和可行性。

Method: 设计部分监督神经网络（PSNN），直接从优化问题的数学结构中推导大部分模型权重，减少对训练数据的依赖。

Result: 在能源系统（DC最优潮流）案例中，PSNN的KKT条件满足率显著高于通用深度NN，且预测速度远超商业求解器，可在一秒内处理百万级参数输入。

Conclusion: PSNN通过结合数学结构与神经网络，在数据效率和计算速度上具有显著优势，适用于实时优化和长期规划（如含随机需求与可再生能源的能源系统）。

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在自旋系统的Gibbs分布下计算局部函数期望值的问题，提出了两种线性规划层次结构，并证明了在特定条件下的快速收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在自旋系统中计算局部函数期望值的问题，旨在提供一种通用的方法，无需预先分析收敛速度即可获得严格的上下界。

Method: 提出了两种线性规划层次结构：第一种基于局部自旋翻转等式，第二种基于以Gibbs状态为不动点的马尔可夫链。

Result: 证明了在空间混合条件或马尔可夫链快速混合条件下，两种层次结构均能快速收敛，并使用准多项式大小的线性程序获得ε-近似值。

Conclusion: 相比传统的蒙特卡罗方法，该方法能够在任何系统中输出严格的上下界，且不需要预先分析收敛速度。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具在高等教育中的日益普及，了解学生如何与这些技术互动并感知它们对于负责任和有效的采用至关重要。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合前后调查、系统使用日志和学生向AI聊天机器人提出的开放式问题的定性分析。

Result: 学生认为AI工具在完成作业和理解课程概念方面最有帮助，但对教学质量的看法不一。伦理问题是全面参与的主要障碍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，学生愿意将AI作为人类教学的补充，但深思熟虑的整合和透明的制度框架对于确保学生的信心、信任和学习效果至关重要。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

provide a mechanism to integrate the material and provide cross-links across
topics.
  In this paper, we present the Curriculum KG Ontology, which we use as a
framework for the dense interlinking of educational materials, by first
starting with organizational and broad pedagogical principles. We provide a
materialized graph for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network use-case, and
validate it using competency questions sourced from domain experts and
educators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有教育工具依赖云服务或闭源模型，存在成本高、隐私风险及定制性不足的问题。预算有限的受监管行业亟需可本地部署、安全且经济的小型LLM解决方案。

Method: 开发端到端开源框架：使用3B-7B参数的小型本地LLM，结合检索/上下文增强生成（RAG/CAG）、交互式微调循环及辅助验证模型，提升内容准确性与抗越狱能力。

Result: 通过大学物理试点验证，该系统在定制教学材料生成与评估中表现出与大型模型相当的实用性，同时满足数据隐私与安全要求。

Conclusion: 经精心设计的小型LLM系统可为教育工作者提供高效、安全、低成本的本地化支持，在特定任务中达到实用化水平。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

Conclusion: 提升用户自主性的推荐系统设计是推动学术进步的关键，此模式可扩展至其他信息平台以应对算法中心化带来的普遍问题。

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

TL;DR: Pegasus提出了一种智能数据平面（IDP）新方法，通过数据平面导向的三大原语（划分、映射、求和归约）和融合技术，解决了现有匹配-动作表（MAT）与深度学习推理不匹配导致的精度下降、规模受限和通用性不足问题，显著提升了模型支持能力与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能数据平面（IDP）使用匹配-动作表（MAT）抽象进行深度学习推理时，存在精度下降、模型规模受限和缺乏通用性三大问题，亟需一种更适配数据平面特性的方法。

Method: Pegasus将深度学习操作转化为三个数据平面原语：Partition（划分高维特征为低维向量）、Map（通过模糊匹配并行计算低维向量）、SumReduce（合并结果），并结合Primitive Fusion优化计算，同时采用全精度权重与定点激活提升精度。

Result: 在P4交换机上的实验表明，Pegasus支持MLP、RNN、CNN、AutoEncoder等模型，平均精度提升22.8%，模型规模扩大248倍，输入规模扩大212倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Pegasus通过数据平面专用原语与优化技术，有效解决了MAT与DL推理的适配问题，在精度、模型规模及通用性上均实现显著突破，为智能数据平面提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Conclusion: 本文为未来大规模语言模型的数据市场建立了一个原则性的基础，确保数据共享的公平性、可持续性和隐私保护。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Conclusion: 谈判视角为长期贝叶斯劝说提供了一个平衡的信息谈判框架，具有公平性和帕累托效率等理想特性。

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

### [264] [Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674)
*Negin Golrezaei,Sourav Sahoo*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在每次拍卖中满足投资回报率（RoI）约束的投标策略，以最大化买家的累积价值。

Method: 引入安全投标策略，并开发多项式时间算法学习最优策略，实现次线性遗憾。

Result: 实验表明，安全投标策略在实际拍卖中显著优于理论界限，具有实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在满足RoI约束的同时，能有效提升买家在拍卖中的表现，适合实际应用。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统层次聚类目标存在近似算法难以突破的理论障碍，需借助外部信息（如预言机）提升算法效果。

Method: 引入分裂预言机判断顶点在最优树中的分离关系，设计多项式时间与近线性时间算法，并扩展至子线性计算场景。

Conclusion: 分裂预言机使算法突破传统理论限制，且方法适用于流式与并行计算，显著提升层次聚类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

### [266] [A Red Teaming Roadmap Towards System-Level Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05376)
*Zifan Wang,Christina Q. Knight,Jeremy Kritz,Willow E. Primack,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文讨论了当前大语言模型（LLM）安全防护中的红队测试研究应优先考虑产品安全规范、现实威胁模型和系统级安全，以应对快速发展的AI技术带来的新威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于LLM红队测试的研究未能优先考虑正确的核心问题，无法有效应对AI技术快速发展带来的新威胁。

Method: 提出红队测试应优先测试产品安全规范、采用现实威胁模型，并关注系统级安全，以提升研究效果。

Result: 通过调整研究优先级，红队测试能更好地识别和应对LLM在实际部署中的安全漏洞和威胁。

Conclusion: 红队测试研究需优先考虑产品安全规范、现实威胁模型和系统级安全，以有效应对AI技术带来的新威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究提出ECLIPSE方法，通过高斯模糊与局部代理模型解决黑盒对抗攻击中鲁棒性、自动检测隐蔽性、人类视觉隐蔽性三者的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法在计算机视觉领域常牺牲部分评估标准（如压缩鲁棒性、隐蔽性）以优化单一指标，而实际攻击场景需同时满足多重约束。

Method: ECLIPSE采用高斯模糊处理采样梯度，并构建局部代理模型，以生成同时满足压缩鲁棒性、抗自动识别和人类视觉隐蔽性的对抗样本。

Result: 在公开数据集实验中，ECLIPSE相比现有方法在三个评估维度上取得更优权衡，验证了其综合有效性。

Conclusion: ECLIPSE为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一种平衡多约束条件的新范式，推动了现实场景下对抗样本可行性的研究进展。

Abstract: Deep learning systems, critical in domains like autonomous vehicles, are
vulnerable to adversarial examples (crafted inputs designed to mislead
classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

### [268] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文通过互信息差分隐私（MI-DP）重新审视1-bit梯度压缩，提出FERRET方法，实现更快的训练、更低的困惑度，并在不添加噪声的情况下提供数学可证明的隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过互信息差分隐私优化梯度压缩，提升训练效率与隐私保护，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 基于signSGD，提出FERRET方法，采用Bernoulli掩码，每组参数最多传输1个符号位，并通过子采样控制隐私损失。

Result: FERRET在多个粒度下均优于DPSGD，困惑度显著降低，训练时间大幅减少，且隐私保护效果与DPSGD相当。

Conclusion: FERRET在隐私、效用和性能三方面取得平衡，训练速度提升5倍，困惑度降低3倍，且无需添加噪声即可提供数学可证明的隐私保证。

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对二进制代码相似性检测（BCSD）模型的优化对抗攻击方法，旨在提高攻击效率和成功率，并增强模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制代码相似性检测在软件工程任务中具有重要作用，但现有的对抗攻击方法缺乏理论支持且效率低下，尤其是在处理复杂程序时。本文旨在改进这些攻击方法，特别是在目标攻击场景下。

Method: 本文利用黑盒、模型无关的解释器来解释模型决策边界，从而定位关键代码片段并进行语义保持的扰动，以提高攻击的精确性和效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有最先进的攻击方法相比，本文提出的方法在几乎所有场景下都实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时提高了效率和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 本文的研究揭示了现有BCSD模型在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了进一步增强模型鲁棒性的迫切需求。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

Motivation: 现有水印方法要么影响生成文本的分布，要么只能嵌入零比特信息，无法进行识别。StealthInk旨在解决这些问题，提供更有效的水印方案。

Method: StealthInk通过隐秘方式在多比特水印中嵌入溯源数据，如用户ID、时间戳和模型ID，无需访问语言模型的API或提示。

Conclusion: StealthInk为大语言模型水印提供了新的解决方案，能够在保持文本分布的同时嵌入溯源信息，增强了快速追溯能力。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated
code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed
to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide
range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types.
Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we
reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free
code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights
for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The
data and code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理广泛应用于客户支持、内容生成和代码辅助，但容易受到提示注入攻击。传统防御方法如输入净化、保护模型和防护栏要么繁琐，要么无效。

Method: PPA通过动态变化系统提示的结构，防止攻击者预测提示结构，从而提升安全性。

Result: 实验表明，PPA能有效抵御现有攻击，并与其他防御方法相比具有优势。

Conclusion: PPA在不影响性能的情况下显著增强了LLM代理的安全性。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

Motivation: 随着深度学习技术的快速发展，预训练编码器模型在特征提取方面表现出色，但其广泛应用也引发了训练数据隐私泄露的风险。本文旨在探讨对比学习框架中的隐私威胁。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于特征向量p-范数的成员推理攻击方法，称为Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack (LpLA)，利用特征向量p-范数的统计分布特性推断成员状态。

Result: 实验结果表明，LpLA在攻击性能和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，特别是在攻击知识和查询量有限的情况下。

Conclusion: 本文不仅揭示了对比学习框架中隐私泄露的潜在风险，还为编码器模型的隐私保护研究提供了实践基础，强调了模型效用与训练数据隐私之间平衡的重要性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SeroneySun/LpLA_code.

fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

*Tianyu Qi,Lei Xue,Yufeng Zhan,Xiaobo Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出Sylva框架，通过两阶段个性化联邦对抗训练解决边缘计算中模型鲁棒性与数据异质性挑战，结合LoRA微调与博弈层选择策略，显著提升通信效率与模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦对抗训练(FAT)在边缘计算中存在模型泛化、无法适应客户端数据异质性及高通信成本问题，需开发兼顾鲁棒性、个性化与效率的防御方案。

Method: Sylva框架分两阶段：1) 使用LoRA进行本地对抗微调，降低通信成本；2) 基于博弈论的层选择策略优化良性数据准确率，实现个性化模型精调。

Result: 实验表明Sylva通信效率提升50倍，对抗鲁棒性增强29.5%，良性数据准确率提高50.4%，优于现有算法。

Conclusion: Sylva通过参数高效微调与动态层选择，为边缘客户端提供定制化防御模型，平衡鲁棒性与准确性，同时大幅降低联邦训练通信开销。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的完全联邦且差分隐私的k-means聚类算法，解决了分布式数据隐私问题，并通过理论分析和实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据越来越多地以分布式方式生成和存储（如边缘设备），传统聚类方法因隐私问题无法直接应用。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种结合服务器端数据的初始化方法，并通过简单的联邦DP-Lloyds算法实现差分隐私聚类。

Result: 该算法在合成和真实世界的基准任务上取得了优异的结果，并提供了收敛速度和聚类识别成功的理论分析。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在保护隐私的同时，能够有效进行分布式数据聚类，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了Joint-GCG框架，首次统一了检索和生成阶段的基于梯度的攻击，显著提高了RAG系统的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统依赖外部知识库，容易受到文档注入攻击。现有攻击策略通常将检索和生成阶段视为独立，限制了攻击效果。

Method: Joint-GCG通过跨词汇投影、梯度标记对齐和自适应加权融合三项创新，统一了检索器和生成器的基于梯度的攻击。

Result: Joint-GCG在多个检索器和生成器上的攻击成功率比现有方法高出最多25%，平均高出5%，且生成的毒药具有前所未有的可转移性。

Conclusion: Joint-GCG框架从根本上重塑了我们对RAG系统漏洞的理解，其创新方法显著提高了攻击效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at
https://github.com/NicerWang/Joint-GCG.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出Stealix方法，首次无需预定义提示即可进行模型窃取，利用预训练扩散模型和遗传算法优化合成图像，显著提升攻击效果，揭示预训练生成模型的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的模型窃取方法依赖人工设计，自动化与扩展性受限，尤其对非专业攻击者不友好。研究旨在探索开源预训练模型在无提示设计技能场景下的实际威胁。

Method: Stealix结合两个开源预训练模型推断受害者模型数据分布，通过遗传算法迭代优化提示词，逐步提升合成图像的精度与多样性，实现无预定义提示的自动化攻击。

Result: 实验表明，在相同查询预算下，Stealix性能显著优于依赖类别名或精细提示的基线方法，验证了其扩展性及预训练生成模型的潜在高风险。

Conclusion: 预训练生成模型在模型窃取中的威胁被低估，Stealix证明无需先验知识的自动化攻击可行，呼吁对相关安全风险进行重新评估。

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.

Motivation: 尽管相似性匹配成本函数在维度减少中具有清晰的生物学解释和成功应用，但其完整的收敛性分析尚不明确。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 本文提出了一种连续时间神经网络（相似性匹配网络），该网络由三种不同时间尺度的动态组成：神经动态、侧向突触动态和前馈突触动态。通过多级优化框架，分析了这些动态的收敛性。

Result: 本文证明了在快时间尺度上成本函数的强凸性和梯度流动态的全局指数收敛性，在中时间尺度上成本函数的强凹性和梯度流动态的指数收敛性，以及在慢时间尺度上非凸且非光滑成本函数的全局最小值和梯度流动态的几乎确定收敛性。

Conclusion: 本文通过数值实验验证了所提出方法的有效性，并提供了对生物合理性神经网络收敛性的完整分析，为未来的研究和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新冠疫情期间，教育模式从传统的面对面学习转向在线平台，导致师生之间的非语言交流减少，进而影响了教育效果。本文旨在通过情感分析来弥补这一沟通缺口。

Method: 研究包括数据准备、特征选择，以及开发一个包含词嵌入、LSTM和注意力机制的深度神经网络模型，并将其与逻辑回归基线进行比较。

Result: 该模型在理解学生反馈方面表现出色，能够更好地捕捉学生情感，从而为教师提供更全面的反馈信息。

Conclusion: 通过整合情感分析，研究为在线教育中的师生沟通提供了新的视角，有望提升在线教育的整体质量。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，围绕情景构建在计算机科学中的使用动机与参与性要素两个核心问题展开分析。

Result: 研究发现现有文献主要将情景用于技术轨迹预测与风险识别，但参与式情景构建方法的应用仍存在空白，可能增强研究包容性。

Conclusion: 通过揭示计算机科学领域情景构建的现状与未开发潜力，强调参与式方法可丰富该领域未来研究的社会价值维度。

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Method: 采用混合方法，通过聊天机器人Litti向老年人提供生成式AI教育，并评估其对AI素养的影响。

Result: 定量数据显示AI素养有提升趋势，但未达统计显著性；定性访谈显示参与者对生成式AI有学习兴趣。

Conclusion: 研究发现设计针对老年人的生成式AI教育存在挑战与机遇，需进一步探索。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

Conclusion: 计算扎根理论框架能够在保持传统方法严谨性的同时，有效利用机器学习和自然语言处理技术，提升大规模定性数据分析的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Motivation: 随着机器学习的发展，确保模型不会对特定群体产生系统性偏见变得尤为重要。评估公平性是机器学习模型开发中的关键环节，以避免模型加剧结构性不平等。

Method: 本文提出了{fairmetrics} R包，提供了一个用户友好的框架，用于严格评估多种基于群体的公平性标准，包括独立性、分离性和充分性等指标。

Result: {fairmetrics} R包通过方便的封装函数提供了多个指标的点和区间估计，并包含了一个基于MIMIC-II数据库的示例数据集。

Conclusion: {fairmetrics} R包为机器学习模型的公平性评估提供了有效的工具，有助于识别和缓解模型中的偏见，确保模型在不同群体中的准确性和校准性。

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep

Method: 本文提出了IaCGen框架，利用迭代反馈机制生成IaC模板，并开发了DPIaC-Eval基准，包含153个真实场景，用于评估语法、部署、用户意图和安全性。

Result: 评估显示，现有LLM在首次尝试时表现不佳，但通过IaCGen框架，所有模型在25次迭代后均达到90%以上的通过率。然而，用户意图对齐和安全性合规性仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型（LLM）的代理系统生成高质量测试用例，构建改进版CodeContests+数据集，验证其评估准确率显著提升并优化LLM强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程问题中测试用例难以获取，导致评估大语言模型推理能力的准确性受限，需通过生成高质量测试用例提升数据集质量。

Method: 开发LLM驱动的代理系统生成测试用例，应用于CodeContests数据集并升级为CodeContests+，通过172万次提交数据验证测试用例质量。

Result: CodeContests+相比原数据集评估准确率显著提高（尤其真阳性率），且测试用例质量提升对LLM强化学习训练产生明显正向影响。

Conclusion: 高质量测试用例能有效提升模型评估准确性，并为LLM的强化学习提供更可靠的基础，验证了测试用例生成在竞争编程任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language
models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive
programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse
datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for
5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

*Jingyu Xiao,Ming Wang,Man Ho Lam,Yuxuan Wan,Junliang Liu,Yintong Huo,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了DesignBench，一个多框架、多任务的前端工程评估基准，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型在生成、编辑和修复任务中的表现，并揭示其在不同条件下的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前端UI代码生成基准存在三大局限：未涵盖主流开发框架（如React/Vue/Angular）、仅关注代码生成而忽略实际开发中的迭代任务（如编辑与修复）、评估维度单一（缺乏对任务难度和输入上下文等因素的分析）。

Method: 构建包含React/Vue/Angular及原生HTML/CSS的多框架基准DesignBench，覆盖生成/编辑/修复三类任务，包含900个涵盖11类主题、9种编辑类型和6种问题类别的网页样本，支持多维度的细粒度分析。

Result: 系统评估揭示了MLLMs在框架适配性、任务相关瓶颈及不同条件下的性能波动，例如框架特定限制（如对某些框架语法支持不足）和任务类型对模型表现的影响。

Conclusion: DesignBench为自动化前端开发研究提供了标准化评估工具，其多维度分析能力可指导未来模型在复杂工程场景中的优化方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/WebPAI/DesignBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到多标签图像分类方法的启发，首次将其应用于更具挑战性的人-物交互分类任务。

Method: 通过将类别查询与交互类别显式关联，并通过Transformer解码器转换为图像特定的类别表示，利用辅助的图像级分类任务进行学习。

Result: 在三个人-物交互基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并在其中两个基准测试中取得了新的最优结果。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用且有效，为人-物交互分类任务提供了一种新的思路。

Abstract: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object
features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query
learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories,
converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,
and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is
motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the
first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification
task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three
representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了GPT-4V在图像取证领域的开箱即用能力，特别是在检测图像拼接篡改方面的表现。通过三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0数据集上的评估，GPT-4V在零样本设置下表现出色，思维链提示在平衡真实和拼接图像检测上效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4V）在复杂视觉语言任务中的潜力，特别关注其在图像取证领域的应用，尤其是检测图像拼接篡改的能力。

Method: 研究方法包括在未进行任务特定微调的情况下，使用三种提示策略（零样本、少样本和思维链）在CASIA v2.0拼接数据集的一个子集上评估GPT-4V的表现。

Result: 结果显示，GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到了超过85%的准确率，思维链提示在真实和拼接图像检测上实现了最平衡的权衡。模型不仅检测到低级视觉伪影，还利用现实世界上下文知识识别不合理的合成图像。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V在检测图像拼接方面落后于专门的先进模型，但其通用性、可解释性和百科全书式的推理能力表明，它在图像取证领域具有作为灵活工具的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Motivation: 随着大量文化遗产被数字化，需要创新方法来简化访问并突出数字藏品的内容，同时探索数字图像的可塑性和当代解释。

Method: 基于自主图像概念，结合开源大语言模型、人脸检测、文本转语音和音频转动画模型，从数字化艺术品自动生成解释性视频。

Result: 提出了一种新框架，能够从数字化艺术品生成解释性视频，动画角色解释艺术品内容，探讨了文化偏见和数字图像在教育中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅挑战了文化偏见，还展示了数字图像和深度伪造技术在艺术教育中的潜力，引发了艺术史领域对这类创意探索的关注。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的两阶段训练框架，通过冷启动和强化学习微调，优化多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的评分准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将质量评分和推理描述视为独立任务，导致模型在评分准确性和解释性之间存在权衡，限制了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段通过专家设计的提示从教师模型蒸馏高质量数据，强化学习微调阶段引入新奖励机制联合优化评分准确性和推理一致性。

Result: Q-Ponder在质量评分回归基准上达到最先进水平，跨域数据集上SRCC提升6.5%，在描述准确性和合理性上显著优于包括教师模型在内的其他模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中的表现，展示了其在多样化任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶技术的快速发展，视觉语言模型（VLMs）在感知和决策中的应用越来越普遍。然而，VLMs的高延迟和计算开销限制了其在时间紧迫的驾驶场景中的有效性。

Method: 本文提出了AD-EE框架，结合自动驾驶的领域特征，并利用因果推理来识别最佳退出层。

Result: 在多个VLM上的大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了延迟，最大改进达到57.58%，并提高了目标检测的准确性，最大增益达到44%。

Conclusion: AD-EE框架有效地解决了VLMs在自动驾驶中的延迟问题，并提高了目标检测的准确性，展示了其在实时驾驶场景中的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

TL;DR: SAVVY-Bench是首个针对动态场景中3D空间推理的基准测试，结合了同步空间音频。SAVVY提出了一种两阶段的无训练推理管道，显著提升了现有AV-LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-视觉大语言模型（AV-LLMs）和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，而忽略了动态3D空间推理这一人类认知的核心能力。

Method: 提出SAVVY，包括两阶段：1）自我中心空间轨迹估计，利用AV-LLMs和其他音频-视觉方法追踪关键对象的轨迹；2）动态全局地图构建，将多模态对象轨迹聚合并转换为统一的全局动态地图。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLMs在动态3D空间推理任务中的性能，设定了新的标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY方法为AV-LLMs在动态3D空间推理领域的发展奠定了基础，展示了其在这一复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要高效且鲁棒的图像表示，特别是在图像包含干扰元素（如阴影、云和光线）时，这些干扰在训练中未暴露时尤为重要。

Method: 设计了自预测动态（SPD）方法，通过并行使用弱增强和强增强，并预测双向增强版本之间的逆向前向转换来学习表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观测中优于先前研究，并显著提升了对未见观测的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法有效提取了任务相关特征，提升了在复杂和未见观测中的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is
available at https://github.com/unigary/SPD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MBRL算法在面对视觉干扰时表现不佳，而现实场景中常常存在任务无关的视觉干扰（如云、阴影和光线），因此需要一种能够提高模型在这些情况下泛化能力的方法。

Method: Dr. G通过双对比学习训练编码器和世界模型，利用多视角数据增强捕捉任务相关特征，并引入递归状态逆动力学模型以更好地理解时间结构。

Result: 在DeepMind Control套件和Robosuite的复杂自然视频背景及随机化环境中，Dr. G相比之前的工作分别提升了117%和14%的性能。

Conclusion: Dr. G通过自监督学习和递归模型显著提高了MBRL在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

Motivation: 人类社交互动的复杂性和多模态特性对人工智能提出了巨大挑战，本文旨在通过引入SIV-Bench来推动该领域的研究。

Method: SIV-Bench包含2,792个视频片段和8,792个精心生成的问题-答案对，这些数据来源于TikTok和YouTube，涵盖多种视频类型和语言文化背景。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench通过系统性地识别当前多模态大语言模型的优势和局限，为开发更具社交智能的AI提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通用的代理模型，通过联合图像和文本的表示生成对抗扰动，评估了视觉问答和视觉推理数据集上的多模态攻击效果，结果表明该方法优于现有的单模态和多模态攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中取得了显著进展，但其对微小扰动的鲁棒性较差，尤其在部署场景中。为了评估这些模型的鲁棒性，需要在视觉和语言模态中引入扰动，以学习模态间的依赖关系。

Method: 训练一个通用的代理模型，该模型可以同时接受图像和文本输入，生成联合表示，并进一步用于生成文本和图像模态的对抗扰动。

Result: 所提出的协调攻击策略在视觉问答和视觉推理数据集上优于其他多模态攻击和单模态攻击，有效削弱了多个预训练多模态模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在生成对抗扰动方面表现出色，能够有效评估和削弱视觉语言模型的鲁棒性，为未来的模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多智能体强化学习方法，用于评估视频分类模型的鲁棒性，通过在时空维度上生成微小扰动来实现更有效的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视频分类模型的鲁棒性比图像模型更具挑战性，主要由于其增加的时空维度和计算成本。本文旨在最小化扰动以诱导模型误分类。

Method: 本文提出了一种多智能体强化学习方法，通过空间和时间的协作学习来识别视频的敏感区域，并生成视觉上难以察觉的微小扰动。

Result: 该方法在Lp度量和平均查询次数上优于现有技术，并允许自定义失真类型，使鲁棒性评估更贴近实际应用。

Conclusion: 本文方法在HMDB-51和UCF-101数据集上对四种流行的视频动作识别模型进行了广泛评估，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管CLIP视觉编码器存在局限，语言解码器能有效补偿视觉特征的不足，推动未来视觉语言模型架构的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨视觉语言模型（VLMs）中语言解码器是否能补偿CLIP视觉编码器的局限性，以优化多模态任务的性能。

Method: 使用三种基于CLIP的VLMs，通过控制自注意力机制进行消融实验，测试其在特定探测任务中的表现。

Result: 发现CLIP视觉表示提供了丰富的语义信息给语言解码器，但在视觉表示上下文减少时，语言解码器能显著补偿并恢复性能。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型中的视觉与语言处理存在动态分工，未来架构应考虑将更多视觉处理任务分配给语言解码器。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Motivation: 当前评估VLMs的基准测试往往集中在特定领域，存在高标注成本、信息泄漏风险，且无法明确失败是源于视觉感知、推理还是常识的局限性。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 受眼科诊断启发，本文提出了一种新的评估方法，通过程序生成合成图像，控制视觉属性，逐步增加内容变化的难度，从而精确揭示VLMs的感知失败。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为评估VLMs提供了一种更精确和可解释的途径，有助于更好地理解模型的视觉感知能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过结构化的数据集和轻量级模型，本文有效提升了自动驾驶系统的决策效率和推理速度，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

TL;DR: MORSE-500是一个新的视频基准测试，用于评估多模态推理能力，弥补了现有测试在时间复杂性、推理技能广度和难度扩展性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态推理基准测试主要依赖静态图像，忽视了现实世界的时间复杂性；且过于专注于数学问题解决，忽略了其他推理技能；此外，许多测试在达到饱和后难以继续评估模型进展。

Method: 通过使用Python脚本、生成视频模型和精选的真实视频片段，程序化生成了500个包含六类推理问题的视频片段，形成MORSE-500基准测试。

Result: 初始实验显示，现有最先进的模型在所有推理类别上均存在显著性能差距，尤其是在抽象和计划任务上表现尤为不足。

Conclusion: MORSE-500提供了一个可扩展的基准测试，支持对下一代多模态推理模型的压力测试，并公开了完整数据集和生成脚本以促进透明和可重复的研究。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

TL;DR: 研究评估了111个视觉语言模型（VLMs）在视线推断任务中的表现，发现94个模型表现不如随机猜测，而人类接近完美。顶尖模型虽有一定能力，但依赖启发式方法，任务难度影响性能，表明VLMs尚无法自然交互，但潜力存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线推断能力是心智理论的关键组成部分，对实现自然的人机交互至关重要。研究旨在评估当前视觉语言模型在此任务上的表现，并与人类能力对比。

Method: 通过控制实验，使用不同难度和多样性的照片，测试了111个VLMs和65名人类参与者的表现，并采用混合效应模型分析行为模式。

Result: 94个VLMs表现不优于随机猜测，人类准确率接近完美。前5名VLMs性能随任务难度增加而下降，但对提示和场景变化较稳健，表明其可能结合启发式与猜测，而非完全随机。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs缺乏视线推断能力，无法实现自然交互，但其部分模型表现出的模式表明潜力仍存，未来需进一步改进。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Motivation: 人类易受光学错觉影响，研究试图探讨机器是否也有类似现象，以深入了解机器的感知和认知过程。

Method: 引入一个包含真实和虚假错觉的视觉问答数据集，并评估大型视觉语言模型在这些任务上的表现。

Result: 尽管模型能正确回答与错觉相关的问题，但其对真实和虚假错觉的回答一致，表明其可能基于先验知识而非真实视觉理解。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型的回答可能依赖于对错觉的先验知识，而非真正的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Motivation: 现有工具在发育中大脑或病理情况下缺乏广泛验证，且颅外组织在MRI中的量化价值未被充分挖掘。

Method: 基于155对MRI-CT扫描数据训练深度学习模型，并在涵盖广泛年龄和脑肿瘤患者的9个数据集中验证，对比AI-CT标签和专家标注。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人中Dice系数中位数0.79，专家标注验证中健康组0.83、肿瘤组0.81，优于现有方法；临床可接受率89%，盲测表现优异。

Conclusion: TissUnet实现了颅外组织的高效、可重复分割，为基于标准脑MRI的大规模研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶VLA模型基准存在场景多样性不足、动作标注可靠性低、评估协议与人类偏好未对齐的问题，需构建更全面的评估体系。

Method: 利用量产自动驾驶车辆用户主动采集数据构建2,610个场景，生成高层离散动作标签，设计动作根植的树状评估框架，支持多模态任务细粒度评估。

Result: 实验表明：SOTA视觉语言模型需视觉+语言双模态引导（缺失视觉输入准确率降3.3%，缺失语言降4.1%，双缺失降8.0%），评估框架可稳定识别模型瓶颈。

Conclusion: DriveAction为提升自动驾驶拟人化决策提供了新视角与严谨评估基础，验证了多模态联合建模的必要性及评估框架的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 探索视觉-语言基础模型是否具备真实的世界模型和动态模型能力，尤其是当动作以语言表达时。现有开源模型在两类模型上均表现不足，但动态模型的微调难度较低，可作为提升世界模型的突破口。

Method: 1) 弱监督学习：利用动态模型为未标记视频帧对标注动作，并提出基于识别模型预测权重的图像token加权目标函数；2) 推理时引导：动态模型为世界模型生成的多个样本分配奖励分数，指导搜索过程。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench动作中心图像编辑任务中，以GPT4o评估在真实世界子集上超越现有方法15%，且在所有子集的人类评估中表现最优，与SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: 动态模型可作为世界模型的基础，通过数据增强和推理引导策略显著提升性能。该方法验证了语言驱动动作下模型对观察-动作关系的建模潜力，并为复杂任务提供了新路径。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLaMR多模态检索模型，通过联合编码视频的视觉、语音、文本和元数据模态，并引入合成训练数据与模态感知损失函数，显著提升动态模态选择能力，在多模态视频检索任务中性能超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频检索系统独立处理各模态信息，导致噪声干扰和性能下降。需动态选择最相关模态组合进行联合检索，但缺乏训练数据与有效模态交互机制。

Method: 1) 构建MultiVENT 2.0++合成数据集，含模态定向查询；2) 提出CLaMR模型：使用统一多模态编码器联合编码4种模态，结合对比学习目标与模态感知损失函数，强化模态选择能力。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++测试集上，nDCG@10比最佳单模态检索器提升25.6，比多模态检索器提升35.4；在长视频QA任务中，帧检索准确率超过LanguageBind 3.50%和密集采样1.42%。

Conclusion: CLaMR通过端到端联合编码与动态模态选择机制，有效抑制无关模态噪声，验证了多模态协同检索的优越性，为复杂视频理解任务提供新解决方案。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）取得了进展，但对长视频内容的全景理解仍是一个重大挑战，部分原因是现有基准测试的局限性。许多基准测试关注边缘细节，鼓励上下文不敏感的检索而非深度理解。

Method: 本文提出了MF$^2$基准测试，包括50多部全长开放许可电影，每部电影配有手动构建的声明对（一个真实声明和一个合理但虚假的声明），共850多对。这些声明针对核心叙事元素，如角色动机、情感、因果链和事件顺序。采用二元声明评估协议，要求模型正确识别真实和虚假声明。

Result: 实验表明，开放权重和封闭状态的最先进模型在人类表现面前仍有很大差距，表明任务对人类相对容易，人类在保留和推理关键叙事信息方面的能力优于当前VLMs。

Conclusion: MF$^2$基准测试揭示了当前VLMs在理解和整合长视频叙事信息方面的不足，突显了人类在这一任务上的优越性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种解决自动驾驶感知系统中传感器数据延迟问题的新方法，通过时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略提升模型在异步数据下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中不同传感器数据存在传输延迟，导致时间错位和物体状态估计不一致，严重影响轨迹预测精度与安全性。

Method: 采用(1)针对LiDAR/雷达的逐点时间戳偏移特征实现细粒度时间对齐，(2)基于实际部署车辆数据模拟传感器延迟模式的数据增强策略，并集成多传感器数据的视角检测模型。

Result: 传统模型在单传感器延迟时性能显著下降，而本方法在同步/延迟场景下均保持稳定优异表现。

Conclusion: 该模型无关方法有效缓解传感器异步问题，显著提升自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性和轨迹预测质量。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

*Quansong He,Xiangde Min,Kaishen Wang,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多尺度特征融合方法，通过将UNet解码过程重新构想为初值问题，解决了现有UNet家族中跳跃连接的两个主要限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UNet家族的跳跃连接存在两个显著问题：不同尺度特征之间缺乏有效交互，以及依赖于简单的拼接或加法操作，限制了信息的高效整合。尽管最近的研究集中在增强编码器和解码器能力，这些问题仍未得到解决。

Method: 提出了一种基于线性多步法的自适应常微分方程方法，将跳跃连接视为离散节点，实现有效的多尺度特征融合。该方法独立于编码器和解码器架构，适用于各种类UNet网络。

Result: 在ACDC、KiTS2023、MSD脑肿瘤和ISIC2017/2018皮肤病变分割数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了特征利用率，减少了网络参数，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多尺度特征融合方法有效克服了UNet跳跃连接的局限性，提升了分割性能，且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决Ego-Exo4D对应挑战中的物体对应任务，旨在从一种视角的物体查询预测另一种视角的对应物体掩码。

Method: 提出多模态条件融合模块，利用视觉掩码和文本描述增强物体定位，并引入跨视角物体对齐模块以提升模型对视角变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 所提方法在Ego-Exo4D物体对应基准测试中排名第二。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合和跨视角对齐，有效提升了物体对应任务的性能，证明了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM) 提出了一种结合快慢架构的端到端驾驶框架，通过选择性多视角提示、多阶段思维链推理及轨迹后处理技术，在Waymo挑战赛中以7.7367分获第二名，超越基线2.77%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统驾驶系统在高级意图生成与低延迟之间存在权衡。HMVLM旨在通过认知启发的快慢架构，使慢分支（大型视觉语言模型）生成高语义意图（如'礼让行人'），同时不影响系统整体响应速度。

Method: 1) 选择性五视角提示嵌入4秒自车运动历史；2) 分阶段思维链提示强制推理流程（场景理解→驾驶决策→轨迹推断）；3) 基于样条的轨迹后处理消除抖动与急转弯。模型基于Waymo Open Dataset训练。

Result: Rater反馈评分(RFS)达7.7367，在2025 Waymo端到端驾驶挑战赛中排名第二，较公开基准提升2.77%。

Conclusion: HMVLM通过视觉语言模型与认知架构的结合，验证了在保持低延迟前提下实现高阶驾驶决策的有效性，为自动驾驶系统设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对半监督语义分割现有评估仅关注精度而忽视可靠性与鲁棒性的问题，提出综合指标RSS，通过实验揭示现有方法在可靠性上的缺陷，倡导评估标准向实际需求对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督分割评估仅关注分割精度，完全忽略可靠性（校准置信度/不确定性）和鲁棒性（多变环境下的稳定性），而这两者对自动驾驶等安全关键场景至关重要。

Method: 提出Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)指标，通过谐波平均综合预测精度、校准质量和不确定性度量，系统性评估模型短板。使用UniMatchV2模型与基线进行跨领域可靠性-鲁棒性对比实验。

Result: 实验表明半监督方法常以牺牲可靠性换取精度提升。UniMatchV2虽在跨域场景展现鲁棒性，但可靠性仍存在缺陷。RSS能有效暴露模型综合性能短板。

Conclusion: 呼吁采用RSS等综合评估指标替代单一精度标准，使半监督学习研究更贴近自动驾驶等现实场景对可靠性/鲁棒性的严苛需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

*Yixuan Zhu,Haolin Wang,Shilin Ma,Wenliang Zhao,Yansong Tang,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FADE方法，通过频率感知分解和频谱引导调制，利用预训练视频扩散模型的内在先验，实现高效、高质量的视频编辑，解决了传统方法在动态处理和计算效率上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像扩散模型难以处理视频动态编辑（如运动调整），而视频扩散模型虽质量高，却因计算量大无法直接应用图像编辑技术，亟需一种高效且保留时空结构的视频编辑方法。

Method: FADE通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，提出频率感知分解策略优化组件分工，并结合频谱引导调制防止信息泄漏，利用频域线索调整采样轨迹，保持时空结构。

Result: 实验表明，FADE在真实视频中能生成高质量、真实且时间连贯的编辑结果，定性与定量评估均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FADE无需训练，通过挖掘视频扩散模型的固有先验，实现了高效、多功能的视频编辑，为动态调整等复杂编辑任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出MOGO框架，通过MoSA-VQ和RQHC-Transformer实现高效的实时3D运动生成，并在多个数据集上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的文本到运动生成技术取得了显著进展，但如何在保持高质量的同时实现实时响应和可扩展性仍是一个挑战。

Method: MOGO框架包含MoSA-VQ和RQHC-Transformer两个关键组件，分别用于运动序列的层次化离散化和多层运动令牌的生成，同时引入文本条件对齐机制提升语义保真度。

Result: 在HumanML3D、KIT-ML和CMP等基准数据集上的实验表明，MOGO在生成质量上与最先进的Transformer方法相当或更优，并在实时性能、流式生成和零样本泛化方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: MOGO框架在保持高质量运动生成的同时，显著提升了实时性能和可扩展性，为文本到运动生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: ODIS提出一种基于对象级自蒸馏的视觉预训练方法，通过对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力提升图像/块级表示，在ImageNet1k上达到82.6% k-NN准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像级自蒸馏方法假设单物体主导，但实际多物体场景中效果受限，且难以扩展至场景中心数据集。

Method: 采用对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力机制隔离对象区域，将场景级任务分解为对象级子任务，引导Transformer关注语义内容。

Result: ViT-Large在ImageNet1k上实现82.6%的k-NN准确率，证明该方法在图像/块级表示均有提升。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏突破传统单物体假设限制，有效处理复杂场景数据，为视觉预训练提供新范式。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Motivation: 传统诊断方法耗时且需要专家解读，Orthopox病毒数据稀缺且存在偏差，因此需要自动化和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用机器学习和预训练深度学习模型结合的方法，提取深层特征表示，无需数据增强。

Result: 该方法在多个评估设置中表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性，实现了出色的分类效果，并保持了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为实际临床部署提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Result: 实验表明，模式归一化显著加速了收敛，且归一化模型在不同区域表现出更高的稳定性。

Conclusion: 归一化在提高SAR图像分割的计算效率和泛化能力方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究利用生成模型从fMRI数据解码图像，但在准确重建高度复杂的视觉刺激方面仍存在挑战，主要源于其元素密度、多样性和复杂的空间结构。

Method: HAVIR模型包含两个适配器：AutoKL适配器将fMRI体素转换为潜在扩散先验，捕捉拓扑结构；CLIP适配器将体素转换为CLIP文本和图像嵌入，包含语义信息。通过Versatile Diffusion融合这些互补表示生成最终重建图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，HAVIR在复杂场景中有效地重建了视觉刺激的结构特征和语义信息，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR模型通过结合结构和语义表示，成功解决了从fMRI数据重建复杂视觉刺激的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文本-图像检索中表现优异，但实际应用中用户搜索行为多为多轮交互，且现有方法依赖抽象语言反馈，导致查询优化困难。需探索更直观的交互式检索方法。

Method: 提出GenIR框架：利用扩散模型在每轮交互中生成可视化图像，显式表达系统对用户意图的理解；开发自动化流程构建多轮心理图像检索（MIR）数据集。

Result: 实验表明GenIR在多轮MIR场景中显著优于现有交互式方法，验证了生成式视觉反馈的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究定义了MIR任务，提出生成式检索方法并构建数据集，为基于心理图像的多轮交互检索提供了新研究基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中取得突破，但在概念化能力上仍有不足。Visual Graph Arena (VGA) 数据集被引入以评估和改进AI系统的视觉抽象能力，实验显示现有模型在视觉理解上存在根本性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉问答中取得进展，但AI系统在识别和推理同一概念时的视觉形式变化能力（即概念化能力）仍存在显著差距，这是人类推理的基本能力。

Method: 引入Visual Graph Arena (VGA)数据集，包含六个基于图的任务，使用多样化的图布局（如Kamada-Kawai与平面布局）来测试视觉形式无关的推理能力，并对现有视觉模型和多模态大语言模型进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，人类在任务中接近完美准确度，而模型在同构检测任务中完全失败，在路径/循环任务中表现有限，进一步发现模型行为异常，表明其仅进行伪智能模式匹配而非真正理解。

Conclusion: VGA数据集为AI视觉模型在人类化概念化能力上的进步提供了框架，揭示了当前AI模型在视觉理解上的根本性局限。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合神经网络和算法的方法，利用多光照条件的32张SPAT图像提升过敏风团检测的准确性，相比传统单图像方法效果更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统皮肤点刺试验（SPT）依赖单一光照图像，可能存在结果不一致性。SPAT设备通过多光照图像提高检测可靠性，但需开发自动化方法处理其独特数据模态。

Method: 方法分为两部分：1）神经网络对32张不同光照图像进行像素级风团分割；2）算法化步骤检测并勾勒风团轮廓。基于868名患者数据，手动标注10,416个风团多边形作为训练基础。

Result: 在217名患者的独立验证集上，使用32张SPAT多光照图像的方法相比传统单图像输入显著提高了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 多光照条件下的SPAT图像能大幅提升过敏风团检测精度，验证了该设备及配套方法的临床价值。

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

### [332] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出样本特异性评分感知噪声注入（SSNI）框架，通过自适应调整每个样本的噪声注入量，提升基于扩散的净化方法（DBP）的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DBP方法对所有样本使用固定噪声水平，但研究发现不同样本的最优噪声水平应不同：样本越干净，注入噪声越少。这一发现促使提出样本特异性噪声调整方法。

Method: SSNI利用预训练评分网络估计样本偏离干净数据分布的程度（评分范数），并通过加权函数自适应调整每个样本的噪声水平t*，实现样本特异性噪声注入。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K数据集上，结合SSNI的DBP方法在准确性和鲁棒性上显著提升，验证了样本特异性噪声分配的必要性。

Conclusion: 通过动态分配不同噪声水平至不同样本，SSNI框架有效优化了DBP方法性能，为对抗噪声净化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于‘corner trees’数学工具的高效张量处理层（FIS层），其计算成本为输入大小的线性级别。该层可集成至神经网络中，用于图像分类和异常检测任务，实验表明在保持精度的同时显著减少参数量和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维张量（如图像）在深度学习应用中普遍存在，但其处理常需次二次方复杂度。现有方法在处理此类数据时计算成本较高，亟需更高效的线性复杂度层结构。

Method: 利用排列计数领域的‘corner trees’数学工具，提出基于多参数泛化签名方法（signature of iterated sums）的FIS层。该层通过线性计算成本实现张量到张量的映射，并兼容现有网络架构（如ResNet）。

Result: 1. 将ResNet部分层替换为FIS后，参数量和计算量减少，精度仅下降0.1%；2. 在MVTec AD纹理异常检测任务中，平均AUROC达97.3%。代码已开源。

Conclusion: FIS层通过数学工具创新实现了高效的高维数据处理，兼具计算效率与模型性能，为图像分类和异常检测任务提供了轻量化解决方案。

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种浅深协同检测网络（SDS-Net），通过双分支架构和自适应特征融合模块，解决了红外小目标检测中浅层与深层特征协作不足的问题，显著提升了检测精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN的红外小目标检测方法忽视浅层与深层特征的异质性，且缺乏跨层级特征依赖关系的系统性建模，导致多级特征互补性未充分挖掘，检测性能受限且计算成本高。

Method: SDS-Net采用双分支架构分别建模特征的结构特性与语义属性，保留浅层空间细节并捕获深层语义；引入自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性，增强特征协作与表征能力。

Result: 在NUAA-SIRST等三个公开数据集上的实验表明，SDS-Net在检测精度和推理速度上均优于现有方法，同时保持低计算复杂度与高推理效率。

Conclusion: SDS-Net通过高效的多级特征协同建模，实现了高精度、低复杂度的红外小目标检测，具有优越的检测性能与广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合高光谱EnMAP数据与Sentinel-2时序数据的双流Transformer架构，构建H2Crop数据集，实现多层级精细作物分类，实验表明高光谱数据可提升分类性能4.2%-6.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有精细作物分类研究难以同时获取物候动态（需多时相卫星数据）和细微光谱差异（需高光谱数据），且高光谱数据获取与标注成本高导致多模态研究稀缺。

Method: 整合30米分辨率EnMAP高光谱与Sentinel-2时序数据构建四层级标注的H2Crop数据集，设计双流Transformer架构：光谱-空间Transformer提取高光谱特征，时序Swin Transformer提取生长模式，结合层级分类头实现多级分类。

Result: 高光谱数据使F1值平均提升4.2%（最高6.3%），在多种时间窗口和作物变化场景中均优于现有深度学习方法，验证了高光谱数据的持续有效性。

Conclusion: H2Crop数据集为精细农业分类提供新基准，双流架构有效融合多模态数据，证明高光谱数据在作物分类中的显著增益，相关代码与数据集已开源。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Motivation: TESS卫星的高时间分辨率全帧图像数据不仅适用于系外行星探测，还能高效识别短周期食双星。这类双星系统是研究恒星形成与演化的重要天体物理实验室，但现有样本不足且分布不均。

Method: 1. 使用神经网络从TESS Sectors 1-82数据中筛选约120万颗具有食特征候选体；2. 通过自动化方法、星历/质心验证及公民科学家人工检查，对6万目标进行深度分析；3. 最终统一验证10001个系统。

Conclusion: 该星表显著扩展了食双星样本库，为恒星研究提供优质数据集。候选目标库将推动后续光谱/测光研究，部分特殊系统可能揭示新的恒星演化机制。

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

Conclusion: LE-FALC为多值非分配逻辑提供了一种描述逻辑对应物，并能在模糊环境中有效推理。

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Conclusion: 该框架为金融领域个性化推荐及跨模态融合任务提供了新思路，验证了多模态融合在推荐系统中的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: 时间序列物品嵌入在推荐系统中具有重要作用，考虑序列信息的图神经网络在推荐性能上优于或至少不逊于不考虑序列信息的系统。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

TL;DR: 本文分析了逆问题中的参数估计，揭示了现有域泛化方法的脆弱性（双重意义定理），并通过实验验证了图像去模糊与医学影像斑点抑制中的域偏移问题。理论分析表明，基于生成模型的数据预处理（如信号恢复）未必能提升后续参数估计性能，需结合信息论的数据处理不等式重新审视策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逆问题与信号恢复是数据科学的核心，但现有方法在域偏移下的参数估计存在局限性。实践中常误认为通过现代生成模型进行数据逆变换（如去模糊）必然提升下游任务（如分类/回归），但缺乏理论支持。本文旨在为安全敏感应用提供更高效的系统设计洞见。

Method: 1. 将域偏移问题与离散参数估计结合，提出双重意义定理；2. 通过图像去模糊和医学影像斑点抑制实验验证理论；3. 对比可逆/不可逆退化过程的参数估计，区分连续（回归）与离散（分类）任务，结合信息论分析数据预处理的影响。

Result: 1. 域偏移下现有泛化方法存在脆弱性，实验验证双重意义定理；2. 数据预处理（如逆变换）可能因信息损失而损害参数估计，尤其对非可逆退化过程；3. 生成模型的高感知质量未必对应更优参数估计性能。

Conclusion: 逆问题中的数据预处理需谨慎，其与参数估计的关系受限于数据处理不等式。研究为安全敏感领域（如医学影像）提供了系统设计洞见：需权衡信号恢复的感知质量与参数估计的信息完整性，避免盲目依赖生成模型。

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world

state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is

*Shibo Li,Yao Zheng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出MPS框架，结合共形推断与模型置信集，解决非平稳时序在线模型选择问题，实时动态筛选最优模型，适应未知变化形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: MPS通过实时更新候选模型置信集合，覆盖下一时段最优模型，并利用共形推断与模型置信集技术，适应任意形式的非平稳性。

Conclusion: MPS作为通用框架，兼容任意数据生成过程、模型类别及评估指标，为非平稳环境下的模型选择提供灵活且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于成对加性噪声模型（PANM）的顺序方法，用于在完全部分有向无环图（CPDAG）中定向无向边，从而恢复真实的因果DAG，并开发了一种新的基于约束的非线性DAG学习算法。

Method: 提出了一种顺序程序，利用成对加性噪声模型（PANM）来识别无向边的因果方向，并开发了一种新的基于约束的算法，用于在非线性加性噪声模型下学习因果DAG。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在理论上和实验中均表现出色，能够有效且高效地恢复真实的因果DAG，为非线性因果发现提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多级蒙特卡罗技术的新型神经模拟推理方法，用于在多个不同成本和精度模拟器可用的情况下，显著提升固定计算预算下的推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经模拟推理（SBI）在模型仅以模拟器形式存在时广泛应用于科学与工程领域，但模拟器计算成本高限制了模拟次数，影响了SBI的性能。

Method: 利用多级蒙特卡罗技术，结合多个不同成本和精度的模拟器，提出了一种新型的神经模拟推理方法。

Result: 通过理论分析和广泛实验证明，该方法在固定计算预算下显著提升了SBI的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了高成本模拟器对神经模拟推理性能的限制，显著提升了推理准确性。

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

Conclusion: 本研究表明，基于LLM的嵌入技术能够在无需训练的情况下，为查询优化提供实际改进，并为基于嵌入的优化器指导系统开辟了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,
embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

Conclusion: 相邻相关分析方法为分类、预测、参数拟合和预测开辟了新的途径，能够有效地表示复杂系统中的空间模式。

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

Motivation: 现有多Agent系统（MAS）设计方法依赖于设计师对部署环境的了解，但在复杂且难以理解的环境中，这些方法成本高且存在安全隐患。

Method: 提出了一种名为AOMEA的方法，结合多Agent强化学习（MARL）与组织模型，生成相关组织规范，辅助MAS工程设计。

Result: AOMEA能够有效降低MAS设计的复杂性，提高可读性，并减少安全隐患。

Conclusion: AOMEA为复杂环境下的MAS设计提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

Conclusion: 通过引入多阶段中间表示和使用conformer，本文提出的方法在说话人日记化任务上取得了更好的性能，展示了更详细的说话人属性表示和局部依赖建模的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本TTS系统在说话人音色还原上表现优异，但难以通过调节副语言/非语言信息控制听众对声音特征(如明暗度)的主观印象。

Method: 使用低维向量编码语音印象对强度，结合大型语言模型将自然语言描述转化为目标向量，实现端到端的语音印象控制。

Result: 主客观实验验证了该方法在语音印象控制上的有效性，且通过LLM生成向量可避免传统方法需要的人工调参过程。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了基于语义描述的细粒度语音印象控制，为TTS系统提供了一种可解释且易用的语音特征调节方案。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CTC模型假设标签上下文独立，但现代强大的编码器仍能隐式学习上下文依赖的内部语言模型。本文旨在研究这种隐式上下文依赖，并提出新的估计方法。

Method: 提出了基于知识蒸馏的上下文依赖ILM估计方法，并引入了两种正则化方法。实验在Librispeech和TED-LIUM Release 2数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，上下文依赖的ILM在跨域评估中优于上下文独立的先验模型，提出的标签级知识蒸馏平滑方法显著提升了词错误率。

Conclusion: CTC模型确实学习了上下文依赖的内部语言模型，且提出的方法在跨域评估中表现优异，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到音乐系统的MOS预测需要同时评估音乐质量和文本提示的匹配度，现有方法难以兼顾。

Method: WhisQ采用Whisper Base进行音频编码，Qwen 3进行文本编码，通过序列级共注意力和最优传输损失实现跨模态对齐。

Result: WhisQ在MusicEval Track-1数据集上显著优于基线，OMQ和TA的Spearman相关系数分别提升7%和14%。

Conclusion: 最优传输正则化对性能提升最大，表明显式跨模态对齐在文本到音乐评估中的重要性。

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.
