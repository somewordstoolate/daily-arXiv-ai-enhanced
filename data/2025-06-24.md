### [1] [Outcome-Based Education: Evaluating Students' Perspectives Using Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17223)
*Shuvra Smaran Das,Anirban Saha Anik,Md Kishor Morol,Mohammad Sakib Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究利用DistilBERT和LIME分析学生反馈，以改进基于成果的教育(OBE)效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析学生反馈，提升教育成果，符合OBE强调的以学生为中心、能力导向的教育理念。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的DistilBERT模型进行情感分类，并结合LIME提高模型预测的可解释性。

Result: 结合Transformer模型和LIME的解释，形成了一个强大且直观的分析框架，能有效识别学生学习体验中的模式。

Conclusion: 该方法更贴近OBE原则，通过数据驱动的洞察力确保教育实践的改进。

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

### [2] [Efficient and Stealthy Jailbreak Attacks via Adversarial Prompt Distillation from LLMs to SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17231)
*Xiang Li,Chong Zhang,Jia Wang,Fangyu Wu,Yushi Li,Xiaobo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Prompt Distillation的方法，使小型语言模型能够对主流大型语言模型进行越狱攻击，验证了该方法在攻击成功率和危害性上的优越性，同时展示了资源效率和跨模型适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在越狱场景中的攻击方法存在效率低、计算成本高、跨模型适应性和通用性差等问题，难以应对快速发展的LLM和新防御策略。

Method: 结合掩码语言建模、强化学习和动态温度控制，通过提示生成和蒸馏方法，使小型语言模型能够对主流大型语言模型进行越狱攻击。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在攻击成功率和危害性上具有优越性，同时体现了资源效率和跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: 本研究探索了将大型语言模型的越狱能力蒸馏到小型语言模型的可行性，揭示了模型的脆弱性，为大型语言模型安全研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

### [3] [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286)
*Luoyang Sun,Jiwen Jiang,Cheng Deng,Xinjian Wu,Haifeng Zhang,Lei Chen,Lionel Ni,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出GTA注意力机制，通过共享注意力图和压缩值缓存，显著降低计算和内存开销，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有注意力机制在计算和内存开销上存在冗余，限制了在资源有限硬件上的部署效率。

Method: GTA包含共享注意力图机制和非线性值解码器，分别减少键缓存大小和压缩值缓存。

Result: GTA减少62.5%计算FLOPs和70%KV缓存，推理速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: GTA有效提升LLM部署效率，平衡性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

### [5] [Semantic uncertainty in advanced decoding methods for LLM generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17296)
*Darius Foodeei,Simin Fan,Martin Jaggi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了不同解码方法对大型语言模型输出语义不确定性的影响，发现结构化解码方法如思维链解码能在保持或提升输出质量的同时增加语义多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解不同解码策略如何影响语言模型输出的多样性和可靠性，特别是在实际应用中需要兼顾两者时。

Method: 通过问答、摘要和代码生成任务实验，分析了思维链解码和推测性采样等新兴解码技术对模型输出的影响。

Result: 结果显示，思维链解码在代码生成任务中Pass@2率提升48.8%，推测性采样在摘要任务中取得更高的ROUGE分数。

Conclusion: 研究结论挑战了多样性与准确性之间存在权衡的传统假设，表明结构化解码方法能同时提升语义探索和输出质量。

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

### [8] [Towards Safety Evaluations of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17352)
*Tatsuhiro Aoshima,Mitsuaki Akiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）的安全评估日益重要，研究发现LLMs可能存在欺骗行为，需通过心智理论能力评估其潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，其在安全评估中可能表现出欺骗行为，需探究这些行为是否源于模型的隐蔽意图。

Method: 回顾心智理论研究，分析其在安全评估中的应用，并评估一系列开源LLMs的心智理论能力发展。

Result: LLMs在阅读理解方面有所提升，但心智理论能力未见显著发展。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的心智理论能力评估仍面临挑战，需进一步研究以提升安全评估效果。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大型语言模型在个人决策中存在响应不一致、对提示微小变化敏感、对不合理补偿接受度高、以及拒绝无不适的金钱收益等问题，质疑其作为决策助手的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在技术任务上表现良好，但其在涉及金钱与用户舒适度权衡的个人决策中的行为尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过量化多个大型语言模型对用户不适（如额外步行、等待、饥饿和疼痛）所赋予的价格，评估其在金钱与舒适度权衡中的决策行为。

Result: 发现四大问题：(1) 模型间响应差异大；(2) 单个模型对提示微小变化敏感；(3) 对重大不适接受极低补偿；(4) 拒绝无不适的高额收益。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在评估人类不适价值时存在严重缺陷，需谨慎考虑其作为决策助手的应用前景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用生成式AI识别和评估数学辅导中导师行为的效果，发现多种大模型能可靠检测辅导行为，并提出了一种经济高效的提示策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管辅导能提高学生成绩，但如何大规模识别和分析辅导行为与学习效果的关系仍是一个开放性问题。本研究旨在探索生成式AI在此领域的可行性和扩展性。

Method: 研究分析了50份大学远程辅导中学生数学辅导的录音转录文本，使用GPT-4、GPT-4o、GPT-4-turbo、Gemini-1.5-pro和LearnLM等模型评估导师的两种技能：有效表扬和应对学生数学错误。

Result: 所有模型都能可靠检测相关情境（如导师表扬学生准确率94-98%，学生数学错误检测准确率82-88%），并与人类判断高度一致（83-89%和73-77%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明大语言模型可用于支持真实场景中的大规模辅导评估，并提出了一种经济高效的提示策略，为AI支持的学习研究提供了可复现的工具。

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility
and research in AI-supported learning.

*Jinhao Duan,James Diffenderfer,Sandeep Madireddy,Tianlong Chen,Bhavya Kailkhura,Kaidi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个信息论框架UProp，用于量化大型语言模型在序列决策中的不确定性，包括内部和外部不确定性，并在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）被集成到涉及现实世界中序列决策的安全关键应用中，了解何时信任LLM的决策变得至关重要。现有的不确定性量化方法主要针对单轮问答格式，导致多步决策场景（如LLM代理系统）未被充分探索。

Method: 论文引入了一个基于信息论的框架，将LLM序列决策不确定性分解为内部不确定性和外部不确定性（互信息量）。并提出了UProp，一种高效的外部不确定性估计器，通过估计轨迹依赖决策过程中的点互信息来间接估计互信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，UProp在多个多步决策基准测试（如AgentBench和HotpotQA）上显著优于现有的单轮不确定性量化基线方法。

Conclusion: UProp不仅提高了不确定性量化的准确性，还展示了在采样效率、潜在应用和中间不确定性传播方面的优势，为LLM在序列决策中的可靠性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）仅通过URL识别政治内容（PC）的能力，并比较了不同模型在多语言和多国背景下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在标注任务中表现出色，但其仅通过URL分类政治内容的有效性尚未充分探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用GPT、Llama、Mistral等先进LLMs，通过分析五个国家（法、德、西、英、美）的多语言文章文本和URL，评估模型性能，并与人工标注和传统机器学习方法对比。

Result: 研究发现URL能够嵌入大部分新闻内容，为准确性与成本的平衡提供了重要视角。

Conclusion: URL级别的分析可以作为全文分析的良好近似，但需考虑上下文限制。研究还为政治学研究中LLMs的使用提供了方法建议。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Motivation: 尽管自动语音识别(ASR)在高资源语言中准确率高，但在语言田野调查中仍面临自发语音、环境噪音和数据稀缺等挑战。

Method: 使用MMS和XLS-R两种模型，在五种类型多样的低资源语言上进行微调，并控制训练数据时长进行基准测试。

Result: MMS在极少量训练数据时表现最优，XLS-R在训练数据超过一小时后性能与MMS相当。

Conclusion: 研究为田野语言学家提供了实用的ASR适应指南，有助于缓解语言记录中的转录瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

*Lesheng Jin,Zhenyuan Ruan,Haohui Mai,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriLocc利用大语言模型和形式化编译器技术，实现跨GPU架构的可验证寄存器分配，性能优于人工调优方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU快速发展，但生产级编译器仍依赖手工调优的寄存器分配启发式方法，需针对每代硬件重新调整。

Method: 结合大语言模型（LLMs）和形式化编译器技术，通过静态分析和验证引导的再生循环，实现跨架构归一化和正确性保证。

Result: 在GEMM和MHA任务上达到85-99%单次分配准确率，性能超越rocBLAS库10%以上。

Conclusion: VeriLocc证明了LLM在编译器优化中的潜力，可自动发现优于人工调优的高性能寄存器分配方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了三个多语言语音数据集的质量问题，提出改进建议以提升数据集和下游模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示公共多语言语音数据集（如Mozilla Common Voice、FLEURS和VoxPopuli）中存在的质量问题，特别是在资源较少的语言中，以促进数据集质量的提升和下游模型的改进。

Method: 方法包括对数据集进行质量审计，将问题分为微观和宏观两个层面，并以台湾闽南语为例进行案例分析。

Result: 研究发现宏观问题在制度化程度较低的语言中更为普遍，强调需要主动的语言规划和数据质量控制。

Conclusion: 结论提出了未来数据集开发的指导原则和建议，强调了社会语言学意识在创建健壮可靠语音数据资源中的重要性。

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

TL;DR: DuaShepherd框架通过结合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学推理任务中表现有限，需要更有效的奖励机制来提升其推理能力。

Method: 提出DuaShepherd框架，整合正确性和潜力两种奖励信号，采用多任务学习架构训练奖励模型。

Result: 在MATH500和ProcessBench等基准测试中，结合两种奖励信号的模型表现优于单一奖励模型。

Conclusion: DuaShepherd框架通过结合两种奖励信号，显著提升了大语言模型的数学推理能力，达到最优性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自监督学习模型如何编码影响口音感知的音系特征变化，发现特定音段的自监督表征能有效预测口音强度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口音感知模型低估了音系特征渐变变化的作用，本研究旨在探索自监督学习模型如何编码这些影响口音感知的特征变化。

Method: 使用CSLU外国口音英语语料库，提取三个特定音段的音系特征概率及自监督表征（Wav2Vec2-BERT和WavLM），结合美国英语母语者的口音评分进行分析。

Result: 分析表明，口音强度最佳预测因子是音段自监督表征中突显感知对比的音系特征子集，且音段与美式/印度英语基准的距离与口音评分显著相关。

Conclusion: 自监督语音表征能通过可解释的音系特征有效建模口音感知，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前农业命名实体识别任务面临高质量数据集稀缺的问题，尤其是中文数据集，且现有研究多忽视农业与水文、气象的关联。

Method: 通过从大量农业文章中精心筛选和标注，构建了包含4,040个句子和15,799个实体提及的AgriCHN数据集，并利用先进的神经网络模型进行基准测试。

Result: AgriCHN数据集在数据质量和实体多样性上表现优异，实验结果表明其对现有模型提出了显著挑战，并具有进一步研究的潜力。

Conclusion: AgriCHN填补了中文农业命名实体识别数据集的空白，为相关研究提供了高质量资源，并展示了其在提升模型性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

*Jonathan Sakunkoo,Annabella Sakunkoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过定制神经形态分析器验证了维基词典中拉丁语和意大利语缺陷动词的可靠性，发现维基词典对意大利语形态空缺的描述高度可靠，但对拉丁语的描述存在7%的误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形态缺陷是语言学中一个有趣但研究不足的现象。解决形态缺陷问题对于提高形态丰富语言的NLP工具准确性至关重要。然而，传统的语言资源往往缺乏对形态空缺的覆盖，因为这些知识的记录和验证需要大量的人力和专业知识。对于未被充分探索的语言中的稀缺语言现象，维基百科和维基词典往往是少数可用的资源之一。尽管它们的覆盖范围广泛，但其可靠性一直存在争议。

Method: 本研究定制了一种新型的神经形态分析器，用于标注拉丁语和意大利语的语料库。利用大量标注数据，通过计算验证了从维基词典中众包的缺陷动词列表。

Result: 研究结果表明，维基词典对意大利语形态空缺的描述高度可靠，但7%的拉丁语词条被列为缺陷动词，却在语料库中显示出强烈的非缺陷证据。

Conclusion: 这种差异凸显了众包维基作为语言知识权威来源的潜在局限性，特别是对于研究较少的现象和语言，尽管它们作为稀有语言特征的资源具有重要价值。通过提供可扩展的工具和方法来保证众包数据的质量，这项工作推动了计算形态学的发展，并扩展了对非英语、形态丰富语言中形态缺陷的语言学知识。

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

TL;DR: TyphoFormer利用大型语言模型生成的自然语言描述作为辅助提示，结合Transformer编码器，显著提升了台风轨迹预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的模型在密集轨迹预测中表现优异，但在稀疏气象轨迹（如台风路径）预测中缺乏上下文知识，影响了预测可靠性。

Method: 提出TyphoFormer框架，通过LLM生成台风数值属性的文本描述，将其作为特殊标记与数值时间序列一起输入统一的Transformer编码器。

Result: 在HURDAT2基准测试中，TyphoFormer在非线性路径变化和历史观测数据有限的情况下，显著优于其他先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过融合文本和序列信息，TyphoFormer有效利用了传统数值特征无法捕捉的上下文线索，提升了台风轨迹预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our
code, data, checkpoints, and training logs to facilitate open SpeechLM research

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力可能更多依赖于记忆的答案模式而非真正的推理，通过实验验证了模型对显式答案的强烈依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型展现出令人印象深刻的推理能力，但越来越多的证据表明它们的成功很大程度上源于记忆的答案-推理模式，而非真正的推理。本研究旨在探究LLMs是否主要依赖于最终答案或推理链的文本模式。

Method: 研究提出了一个五级答案可见性提示框架，系统地操纵答案线索，并通过间接的行为分析来探测模型行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，当答案线索被掩盖时，即使有完整的推理链，模型的性能下降了26.90%，显示出LLMs对显式答案的强烈依赖。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明LLMs展现的推理可能更多是事后合理化而非真正的推理，质疑了它们的推理深度。研究通过严格的实证验证揭示了答案锚定现象，并强调了对LLMs中推理构成的更细致理解的需求。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing

modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using
LLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient

techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: SITPCL在零样本对话立场检测中达到最先进水平，但F1-macro分数仅为43.81%，显示该任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: ZS-CSD数据集和SITPCL模型推动了零样本立场检测研究，但该领域仍需进一步突破性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel
language models and more efficient training/finetuning methodologies, the idea
of prompt engineering and subsequent optimization strategies with LLMs has
emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables
rigorous assessment of prompt optimization and LLM-based predictive pipelines
under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HIDE的单次训练自由方法，通过解耦表示来检测语言模型中的幻觉内容，显著提高了检测效率并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在生成内容时经常产生事实错误或与输入上下文不符的幻觉内容，这一问题严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的多遍检测方法计算成本高且延迟大，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: HIDE方法基于统计解耦假设，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则（HSIC）量化语言模型内部表示与生成输出之间的解耦程度，从而实现单次检测。

Result: 在四个问答数据集和六个不同规模的开源语言模型上进行的实验表明，HIDE在几乎所有设置中都优于其他单次检测方法，AUC-ROC平均相对提升约29%，同时计算时间减少51%。

Conclusion: HIDE通过利用语言模型内部表示的解耦，提供了一种高效且实用的幻觉检测方法，显著提升了检测性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理结构化诊断代码和非结构化叙述笔记，或采用简单的融合策略，忽略了方向性和层次性的因果交互作用。

Method: 提出THCM-CAL模型，构建多模态因果图，通过分层因果发现推断三种临床交互作用，并采用多标签ICD编码的置信区间校准。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验结果表明，THCM-CAL模型优于现有方法。

Conclusion: THCM-CAL模型通过多模态因果交互和置信校准，显著提升了临床风险预测的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Motivation: 现有电商站外营销内容存在模板化、与落地页匹配度低的问题，导致效果受限。人工审核生成广告成本高昂，需开发自动化解决方案。

Method: 1) MarketingFM：基于检索增强的系统，整合多源数据生成关键词定制化广告；2) AutoEval-Main：结合规则指标与LLM评估技术；3) AutoEval-Update：通过LLM-人类协作框架动态优化评估标准。

Result: 定制化广告点击率提升9%，展示量增加12%，CPC降低0.38%。AutoEval-Main与人工评估一致率达89.57%，AutoEval-Update进一步减少人工审核工作量。

Conclusion: 自动化系统能有效提升广告效果与评估效率，但关键阈值设定与优化验证仍需人工参与，形成人机协同的闭环优化体系。

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在事实性幻觉问题，连续编辑时新增参数会损害模型通用能力。需要一种方法在持续修正错误时减少对模型整体性能的影响。

Result: 在连续编辑任务中显著超越基线，单次编辑保持竞争力，编辑过程中模型通用NLP能力得到保持。

Conclusion: QueueEDIT框架有效解决了连续编辑中的参数偏差问题，实现了编辑性能与通用能力的平衡。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出缺乏多样性的原因，提出分支因子（BF）量化输出分布的概率集中现象，发现对齐调优显著降低BF，并解释了其对推理稳定性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐的大型语言模型（LLM）能力强大，但其输出往往缺乏多样性。本文旨在探究这种生成稳定性的驱动因素。

Method: 通过引入分支因子（BF）——一种量化生成过程中有效可能下一步数的指标，分析模型输出分布的概率集中现象。

Result: 研究发现：（1）BF随生成过程递减，表明LLM生成时更趋可预测；（2）对齐调优显著降低BF（如从12降至1.2），解释了其对解码策略不敏感的原因。对齐思维链（CoT）模型利用此效应，通过生成长推理链进入低BF阶段，获得更稳定输出。

Conclusion: BF是理解和控制LLM输出的有效诊断工具，揭示了对齐如何减少变异性、CoT如何促进稳定生成，以及如何引导基础模型远离多样性。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话场景中的安全风险研究不足，现有方法难以适应对话动态变化，亟需更有效的越狱技术以识别潜在威胁。

Method: 提出一种多轮越狱方法，在每轮交互中全局优化越狱路径，并主动伪造模型响应以抑制安全警告，从而增加后续问题中生成有害内容的概率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在六种先进LLMs上均优于现有单轮和多轮越狱技术，显著提高了有害内容的生成率。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅填补了多轮越狱技术的空白，也为LLMs的安全防御提供了重要参考，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 通过利用阶段间的结构冗余，创新散射模型有效提升了LLMs在多阶段流程中推广和应用新想法的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a

Conclusion: 引入并行层处理下采样输入是一种有效提升早期退出模型性能的方法，适用于资源受限的语音识别场景。

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合抽取式和生成式方法的混合文本摘要技术，以解决大语言模型在生成长文档摘要时关键信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息来源的多样化，自动文本摘要的需求日益增长。尽管大语言模型在生成式摘要方面取得了进展，但在处理长文档时存在资源消耗大和关键信息丢失的问题。

Method: 该方法将文档分割为小块文本，聚类其向量嵌入，为每个代表关键思想的聚类生成摘要，并通过马尔可夫链图选择语义顺序构建最终摘要。

Result: 提出的混合方法有效结合了抽取式和生成式摘要的优点，能够更好地保留长文档中的关键信息。

Conclusion: 混合摘要方法为解决大语言模型在长文档摘要中的局限性提供了有效途径，平衡了资源消耗和信息保留的需求。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

*Esteban Garces Arias,Hannah Blocher,Julian Rodemann,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christoph Jansen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于广义随机优势（GSD）的统计推断框架，用于评估LLM生成文本的质量，解决了现有评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估LLM生成文本质量的方法往往依赖单一指标或简单聚合，无法捕捉文本质量的多维度权衡（如连贯性、多样性、流畅性等）。

Method: 采用广义随机优势（GSD）框架，支持多维度评估，避免对指标的任意加权，并解决自动指标与人工判断的不兼容性问题。

Result: 该框架能够识别解码策略在统计上的显著性能差异，同时考虑了采样设计中可能偏离独立同分布假设的情况。

Conclusion: GSD-front方法为LLM生成文本的评估提供了一种更全面、统计可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种现代方法在捷克语指代消解任务上的表现：基于提示工程的大语言模型和微调的紧凑生成模型。结果显示，微调模型（尤其是mT5-large）在准确率和计算资源消耗上均优于提示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指代消解对自然语言理解至关重要，尤其在形态丰富的语言（如捷克语）中。本文旨在评估两种现代方法在捷克语指代消解任务上的效果。

Method: 使用来自Prague Dependency Treebank的数据集，评估了多种指令调优的大语言模型（如Mistral Large 2和Llama 3）的提示模板效果，并与专门为捷克语指代消解微调的mT5和Mistral模型进行对比。

Result: 实验表明，提示方法在少样本场景下达到74.5%的准确率，而微调模型（如mT5-large）显著优于提示方法，达到88%的准确率，且计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 微调模型在捷克语指代消解任务上表现更优，尤其在准确率和资源效率方面。研究还分析了不同指代类型、先行词距离和语料库来源对性能的影响。

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,
especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a
comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech
text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency
Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2
and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against
fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source
corpora, highlighting key strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双组件框架InspireScore和InspireDebate，用于改进基于大语言模型的辩论系统，通过多维度评估和优化方法显著提升了辩论质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的辩论系统主要关注对特定论点的回应，而忽视了真实性、逻辑有效性等客观评估，且缺乏结构化优化方法，限制了其效果。

Method: 论文提出了双组件框架：(1) InspireScore，一个包含主观和客观指标的多维度评估系统；(2) InspireDebate，通过分阶段优化方法（如CoT推理增强、多维DPO和Web-RAG）优化辩论框架。

Result: 实验表明，InspireScore与专家判断的相关性比现有方法高44%，InspireDebate比基线模型表现提升57%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的框架显著提升了辩论系统的评估和优化能力，为未来研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

*Yicheng Fu,Zhemin Huang,Liuxin Yang,Yumeng Lu,Zhongdongming Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Chengyu-Bench，一个评估语言模型对中文成语理解能力的综合基准测试，包含三个任务，并发现模型在情感判断上表现良好，但在文化语境理解上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语（Chengyu）蕴含丰富历史文化，其字面翻译常无法传达完整含义，现有基准测试任务单一，无法全面评估语言模型对成语的理解和运用能力。

Method: 研究团队构建了Chengyu-Bench基准测试，包含2,937个人工验证的成语用例，覆盖1,765个常见成语，设计了三个任务：情感评价、语境适用性判断和开放式填空。

Result: 测试显示，领先的语言模型在情感评价任务上准确率超过95%，但在语境适用性上约为85%，开放式填空任务中仅40%的准确率，错误多源于对成语含义的根本误解。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管语言模型能可靠判断成语情感倾向，但仍难以把握文化语境细微差别，Chengyu-Bench为评估和改进模型对成语的理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多跳问答框架（MHQA）来检测大语言模型（LLM）在心理健康领域的偏见，并展示了两种去偏技术的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在心理健康领域的应用可能传播偏见，加剧对边缘群体的污名化伤害。现有研究缺乏系统性检测交叉偏见的方法，因此需要开发更有效的检测和去偏技术。

Method: 使用多跳问答框架（MHQA）分析IMHI数据集中的症状表现、应对机制和治疗方案，通过年龄、种族、性别和社会经济地位等标签检测交叉偏见。评估了四种LLM模型，并采用角色扮演模拟和显性偏见减少两种去偏技术。

Result: MHQA方法在偏见检测上优于传统方法，发现LLM在情感、人口统计和心理健康条件上存在系统性差异。两种去偏技术通过少量样本提示实现了66-94%的偏见减少。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在心理健康领域中的偏见传播问题，并提供了可行的去偏技术，为开发更公平的AI提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为句法和计算语言学研究提供一个公开可用的资源，解决语法性和可接受性判断的差异问题。

Method: 数据集来自教科书和《Linguistic Inquiry》期刊，通过众包获取可接受性状态，并采用最高实验标准。

Result: 发现语法性和可接受性判断在83%的情况下一致，机器学习模型在预测可接受性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 数据集是目前同类中最大的公开资源，未来将扩展数据集并进一步研究。

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现自回归Transformer语言模型中存在一个关键漏洞：长破折号会导致语义漂移和子句边界幻觉。作者提出了一种无需重新训练模型的新方法，通过符号子句净化和嵌入矩阵调整来解决问题，显著提升了生成文本的一致性和主题保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归Transformer语言模型在长文本生成中容易出现语义漂移和子句边界幻觉问题，尤其是长破折号等标点符号会引发递归性错误。这一问题影响了模型的生成质量和安全性，亟需解决方案。

Method: 结合符号子句净化（phi-infinity算子）和针对性嵌入矩阵重新对齐，提出了一种无需重新训练模型的解决方案。该方法通过固定点收敛保证来维持语义连贯性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能显著提升生成文本的一致性和主题保持能力，完全抑制问题标记的影响，同时保持语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了一个通用框架，用于识别和缓解基础模型中的标记级漏洞，对AI安全性、模型对齐以及大语言模型的稳健部署具有直接意义。该方法还可推广到解决神经文本生成系统中更广泛的递归不稳定性问题。

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征共激活技术，从少量提示中识别语义连贯的组件，并通过消融和放大这些组件来观察模型输出的变化。

Result: 国家相关组件主要出现在模型的早期层，而更抽象的关系组件集中在后期层；后期层节点对模型输出的因果影响更强。

Conclusion: LLMs内部知识呈现模块化组织，为高效、针对性的模型操控提供了新方法。

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在对阿拉伯和穆斯林的文化偏见，这种偏见会延续有害的刻板印象和边缘化问题。尽管偏见问题日益受到关注，但专门针对阿拉伯和穆斯林群体的提示工程策略研究仍然不足。

Method: 采用混合方法的系统综述，遵循PRISMA指南和Kitchenham的系统综述方法，分析了2021-2024年间发表的8项实证研究，探讨偏见缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现五种主要提示工程方法：文化提示、情感启动、自我去偏技术、结构化多步流程和参数优化连续提示。其中结构化多步流程效果最佳，偏见减少高达87.7%，但技术要求较高；文化提示则更易实施且效果显著。

Conclusion: 提示工程可在不修改模型参数的情况下有效减少文化偏见，但研究数量有限，未来需开发文化适应性提示技术、建立特定评估资源，并整合其他去偏方法以应对更深层次的刻板印象。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

TL;DR: TranslationCorrect是一个集成框架，旨在优化机器翻译后编辑和研究数据收集流程，结合MT生成、自动错误预测和直观后编辑界面，提高效率与用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译后编辑和研究数据收集流程效率低下且不连贯，亟需一种集成化解决方案来提升工作流效率。

Method: TranslationCorrect整合了NLLB等模型的MT生成、XCOMET或LLM API的自动错误预测（含详细推理）以及符合HCI原则的后编辑界面，支持批量翻译和高质量错误标注（ESA格式）。

Result: 用户研究表明，该框架显著提升了翻译效率和用户满意度，其输出的标注数据兼容前沿错误检测模型，适用于训练MT或后编辑系统。

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect通过一体化设计解决了传统流程的割裂问题，为译者和研究者提供了高效、低认知负荷的工具，并验证了其实际效益。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

*Kang Chen,Mengdi Zhang,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为L²的多语言统一学习方法，通过解码干预策略提升大语言模型在多语言推理中的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在测试时扩展的挑战，特别是在数据和推理效率方面，探索多语言推理的多样性及其潜在优势。

Method: 采用L²多语言统一学习方法，结合两种多语言数据（完整的长链思维注释和逐步混合语言），并通过解码干预策略进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，即使少量数据也能显著提升推理能力，多语言学习在减少数据和推理令牌的同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: L²方法为大语言模型的数据收集和测试时计算效率挑战提供了有前景的解决方案，并强调了多样化数据选择的重要性。

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了六种评估指标在自动生成诊断报告中因果解释质量的准确性，发现GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯和临床有效的因果叙述方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估不同评估指标如何准确捕捉自动生成诊断报告中因果解释的质量，以支持需要可解释性和因果推理的任务。

Method: 研究比较了六种指标（BERTScore、余弦相似度、BioSentVec、GPT-White、GPT-Black和专家定性评估），并应用了两种加权策略：任务特定优先级和等权重分配。

Result: 结果显示，GPT-Black在识别逻辑连贯和临床有效的因果叙述方面表现出最强的判别力，GPT-White也与专家评估高度一致，而基于相似度的指标与临床推理质量存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了指标选择和加权对评估结果的影响，支持在需要可解释性和因果推理的任务中使用基于LLM的评估方法。

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新的阿拉伯语词形还原方法，通过分类到Lemma-POS-Gloss标签集，结合机器翻译和语义聚类，并创建了一个新的多样化测试集。结果表明分类和聚类方法更稳健且可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语等形态丰富的语言在词形还原上面临现有工具标准不一致和体裁覆盖有限的问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用分类方法将词形还原问题转化为Lemma-POS-Gloss标签集的分类任务，结合机器翻译和语义聚类技术。

Result: 分类和聚类方法在阿拉伯语词形还原中表现更稳健且可解释，优于字符级序列到序列模型，后者易产生不合理的词形。

Conclusion: 论文提出的分类和聚类方法为阿拉伯语词形还原设定了新的基准，提供了更可靠和可解释的结果。

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于表格数据的隐含语义、复杂性和结构化特性，大语言模型在处理表格推理任务时面临挑战，缺乏有效的评估基准来全面反映其性能。

Method: 通过迭代数据处理流程构建高质量数据集，并设计包含26个子任务的评估框架，采用TCoT、PoT和ICoT三种推理模式进行评测。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有大语言模型在处理复杂现实表格任务时仍有显著改进空间，数据集和框架已公开。

Conclusion: TReB基准填补了表格推理评估的空白，为未来研究提供了可靠工具，同时揭示了当前模型的不足。

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and
the framework on [GitHub].

TL;DR: 论文提出MeRF方法，通过将奖励规则直接注入提示语来增强LLM的推理能力，结合上下文学习与强化学习，在逻辑谜题基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法忽视了LLM的上下文学习能力（如思维链提示的成功所示），作者希望探索如何有效结合强化学习与上下文学习以提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出MeRF方法，在提示中直接注入奖励规则作为上下文动机，使模型在优化目标意识下改进响应，利用LLM的上下文学习能力对齐生成与优化。

Result: 在Knights and Knaves逻辑谜题基准上，MeRF显著超越基线模型；消融实验显示动机与奖励函数一致性越高性能越好，模型还能通过强化学习适应误导性动机。

Conclusion: MeRF通过简单修改有效结合强化学习与上下文学习，为提升LLM推理能力提供了新思路，同时展示了模型对动机与奖励一致性的敏感性和适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在NLP任务中的广泛应用，需要全面评估其在不同任务中的表现，以了解其优势和局限性，从而为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 研究采用结构化实验协议，使用相同的中性提示，在两个基准数据集上对ChatGPT和DeepSeek进行测试，涵盖情感分析、主题分类、文本摘要、机器翻译和文本蕴含五个任务。

Result: 结果显示，DeepSeek在分类稳定性和逻辑推理方面表现更优，而ChatGPT在需要细致理解和灵活性的任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务需求选择合适的LLM提供了有价值的参考，强调了不同模型在不同任务中的优势。

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了端到端（E2E）框架在口语语法错误纠正（SGEC）和反馈生成中的应用，通过自动伪标签和上下文信息提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口语语法错误纠正（SGEC）因语音不流畅、转录错误和缺乏结构化输入而面临挑战，传统级联系统易受模块间错误传播影响，因此研究E2E框架以提升效率和准确性。

Method: 研究比较了级联、部分级联和E2E架构，基于Whisper基础模型，采用自动伪标签框架扩充训练数据，并利用ASR输出增加上下文信息，提出参考对齐过程和编辑置信度估计以优化反馈。

Result: 在Linguaskill和Speak & Improve语料库上的实验表明，所提方法显著提升了E2E SGEC系统的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合自动伪标签、上下文信息和置信度估计，E2E SGEC系统在口语语法纠正和反馈生成方面表现出显著改进。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，对预训练Transformer模型进行微调反而会降低MS MARCO段落排序任务的性能，挑战了传统迁移学习的有效性认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为何在MS MARCO段落排序任务上，微调预训练Transformer模型会导致性能下降的反常现象。

Method: 通过五种模型变体（包括全参数微调和参数高效的LoRA适配）进行综合实验，分析嵌入空间结构变化及训练动态。

Result: 所有微调方法表现均不及基础模型（MRR@10: 0.3026），微调破坏了预训练学习到的最优嵌入空间结构。

Conclusion: 结果挑战了传统迁移学习在饱和基准上的有效性，表明可能需要架构创新来实现实质性改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

Motivation: 仇恨言论检测是自然语言处理在社交公益中的重要应用，但仇恨言论的定义存在模糊性，影响模型性能。论文旨在探讨不同定义如何影响模型表现。

Method: 论文首先收集并分析了现有仇恨言论定义，构建了一个包含14个概念元素的分类法。随后，在三个不同类型的数据集上，对三个大型语言模型进行了系统的零样本评估。

Result: 研究发现，选择不同具体程度的定义会影响模型性能，但这种影响在不同模型架构中并不一致。

Conclusion: 仇恨言论定义的具体程度对模型性能有影响，但这种影响因模型架构而异，未来研究需考虑定义的选择与模型适配性。

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续思维链虽能节省推理标记，但其顺序依赖导致训练时间长，影响效率。

Method: 采用Jacobi迭代并行更新潜在思维标记，替代原有顺序更新，提升并行训练能力。

Result: 实验显示PCCoT在适当迭代次数下性能相当或更优，节省50%时间，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: PCCoT显著提升连续思维链的效率与稳定性，为大规模语言模型推理提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于澄清尽管数据污染是一个重要问题，但它并不完全阻止对LLM群体中自组织和模型依赖的涌现动态的研究。

Method: 通过分析Barrie和Törnberg对Flint Ashery等人研究的批评，论文提出了在特定社会惯例案例中观察到的涌现动态。

Result: 结果表明，即使在存在数据污染的情况下，LLM群体中的自组织和涌现动态仍然可以被研究和观察到。

Conclusion: 结论指出，数据污染虽然是一个挑战，但并不妨碍研究LLM群体中的涌现行为，特别是在社会惯例等具体案例中。

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义相似度估计在自然语言处理和自然语言理解中具有重要应用，如问答、语义搜索等。研究旨在评估不同先进技术在此任务上的表现。

Method: 使用USE、InferSent和BERT模型，在两个问题对数据集（一个特定领域内部数据集和一个公开的Quora问题对数据集）上进行语义相似度估计。

Result: BERT模型的表现显著优于其他方法，特别是在特定领域数据集上，这归因于其训练过程中的微调过程。

Conclusion: 对于特定领域数据，BERT是最佳选择，其微调过程使其能够基于训练数据学习模式。

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型（如GPT-4o）如何理解并操作公共演讲中的说服力概念，尤其关注其是否采用类人优化策略。

Method: 使用3MT法语数据集，修改博士候选人演讲文本，通过GPT-4o生成增强/削弱说服力的版本，并分析修辞手法和话语标记等文本特征的变化。

Result: GPT-4o通过操纵情感词汇和句法结构（如疑问句、感叹句）来放大修辞效果，但表现为系统性风格调整，而非人类式说服力优化。

Conclusion: GPT-4o对说服力的操作依赖形式化语言模式，揭示了当前模型与人类说服策略的差异。

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到词分割计算模型的启发，探索是否可以通过分组可预测的字节而非简单地汇集它们的表示来生成有用的固定子词词汇。

Method: 提出ByteSpan，一种新的信息驱动子词分词器，利用外部字节级语言模型在训练过程中识别连续可预测的字节序列，并将它们分组为子词。

Result: 实验表明，ByteSpan生成的词汇效率更高，英语的形态对齐分数优于BPE。多语言实验在25种语言中表现出相似的压缩和Rényi效率。

Conclusion: ByteSpan通过分组可预测字节序列的方法，有效提升了子词分词的效率和形态对齐性能，适用于多种语言。

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

*Christian Huber,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在推理过程中动态修正语音识别错误的方法，特别针对训练中未见的词汇，如专有名词和领域特定词汇，显著提升了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经序列到序列系统虽然在自动语音识别上表现优异，但在处理训练中未见的词汇（如专有名词、缩写和领域特定词汇）时仍存在困难，尤其是发音与拼写不匹配的情况。

Method: 提出了一种允许用户在推理过程中动态添加修正的方法，以改进对具有发音-拼写不匹配的词汇的识别准确性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能将偏置词错误率相对降低高达11%，同时保持整体词错误率的竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了语音识别系统对训练中未见词汇的识别能力，特别是在发音与拼写不匹配的情况下，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注内容知识，缺乏对教学法（教学方法与实践）的评估。为了衡量大语言模型在教育领域的潜力，需要开发专门的教育基准测试。

Method: 基于教师专业发展考试的精选问题集，构建了跨领域教学知识（CDPK）和特殊教育需求与残疾（SEND）教学知识的基准测试，涵盖教学策略、评估方法等子领域。

Result: 测试了97个模型，准确率在28%到89%之间。分析了成本与准确率的关系，并提供了在线排行榜，支持按模型属性和学科分类进行交互式探索。

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs依赖自动提示工程优化用户输入，但用户需求多样性常导致自动优化曲解原意，产生错误输出。

Method: 提出自适应贪婪二分搜索（AGBS）方法，模拟常见提示优化机制，同时保持语义稳定性，动态评估策略对LLM性能的影响。

Result: 在开源和闭源LLMs上的实验表明，AGBS能有效平衡语义一致性与攻击效果。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可靠的提示优化系统提供了实用见解，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

Conclusion: ASP2LJ框架及RareCases数据集为自动化司法系统研究提供了新工具，公开代码和数据以促进后续研究。

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在简单任务中存在自洽性问题，提出了两种自动化方法进行量化与缓解，但问题仍未完全解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）能力日益强大，但其决策的透明性和可信赖性需要模型具备自洽性（即内部推理无矛盾）。研究发现即使是简单任务，现有模型（包括先进模型）也存在自洽性问题，因此需量化并缓解这些不一致性。

Method: 研究引入了不一致性度量指标，并提出两种自动化方法：基于图的方法和基于能量的方法，以量化并缓解模型的不一致性问题。

Result: 实验表明，所有较小模型在简单任务中高度不一致，即使是先进模型（如DeepSeek-R1和GPT-o4-mini）也未完全自洽。提出的方法部分改善了问题，但未彻底解决。

Conclusion: 自洽性对构建更可靠、可解释的AI至关重要，但当前方法仅能部分改善问题，凸显了该问题的复杂性。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

Method: 基于Atropos Health专有数据开发RWESummary基准，包含一个场景和三种评估，用于检测医学研究摘要中的主要错误类型。

Result: 在13项真实世界证据研究中，Gemini 2.5模型（包括Flash和Pro版本）整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: RWESummary可作为真实世界证据研究摘要任务的新型基础模型基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

Motivation: 解决长语音实时翻译的独特挑战，避免从头训练端到端模型，利用预训练模型适应流式场景。

Method: 采用Whisper Large-V3-Turbo进行语音识别，NLLB-3.3B进行机器翻译，结合文档级前缀训练、自适应发射策略（wait-k和RALCP）及缓冲区管理技术。

Result: 在ACL60/60数据集上取得31.96 BLEU和2.94秒延迟；官方测试集(IWSLT25Instruct)初步得分为29.8 BLEU。

Conclusion: 证明通过轻量适配预训练组件，无需大量领域数据或端到端训练，即可构建高效的长语音实时翻译系统。

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

TL;DR: 论文提出STUPID方法，通过PID控制器动态调整推理过程中的激活引导强度，以减少冗余推理步骤并提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在扩展思维链推理中常出现过思考现象，导致冗余推理步骤增加计算成本并可能降低性能。现有静态引导方法缺乏动态调整能力。

Method: 提出STUPID方法，结合块级分类器检测冗余推理模式，并使用PID控制机制基于预测冗余概率动态调整引导强度。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，STUPID实现了6%的准确率提升，同时减少32%的token使用，优于静态引导基线。

Conclusion: STUPID提供了一种动态推理校准框架，在保持推理质量的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能有效解决长文本生成挑战，开源模型为相关研究提供新基准。

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

Motivation: 随着LLM在长上下文应用中的普及，KV缓存在GPU上的内存占用成为瓶颈，需高效压缩方案。

Method: 结合加法量化与轻量编码器压缩KV缓存，设计兼容RoPE的可交换码本，并通过EM算法训练实现高效解码。

Result: 在128K上下文下，FP16 KV缓存减少87.5%，2-bit量化优于现有方法，1-bit量化可在RTX 4090上运行LLaMA-3.1 8B模型。

Conclusion: CommVQ以低开销实现高精度KV缓存压缩，为长上下文LLM部署提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学奥林匹克级问题上表现优异，但依赖有限策略，难以应对需要新思路的问题。为系统研究这些限制，作者设计了OMEGA基准。

Method: OMEGA基准通过程序化生成训练-测试对，评估三种泛化能力：探索性、组合性和变革性。问题涵盖几何、数论等多个领域，解决方案通过符号、数值或图形方法验证。

Result: 前沿大语言模型在问题复杂度增加时性能急剧下降。微调Qwen系列模型后，探索性泛化有显著提升，但组合性泛化有限，变革性推理几乎无改进。

Conclusion: OMEGA基准通过细粒度失败分析，为提升大语言模型的数学创造力奠定了基础，超越了机械熟练度。

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

TL;DR: ReasonFlux-PRM是一种新型轨迹感知过程奖励模型，旨在评估轨迹-响应类型的推理过程，通过细粒度奖励分配提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）主要基于模型最终输出进行训练，难以稳健评估中间推理轨迹，尤其是在前沿推理模型生成的轨迹-响应输出场景中。

Method: 提出ReasonFlux-PRM，结合步骤级和轨迹级监督，支持离线和在线奖励监督，包括高质量数据筛选、密集过程奖励和政策优化。

Result: 在AIME、MATH500和GPQA-Diamond等基准测试中，ReasonFlux-PRM-7B表现优于大型PRMs和人工筛选基线，平均提升12.1%（监督微调）、4.5%（强化学习）和6.3%（测试时扩展）。

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM有效提升了推理轨迹评估质量，并发布了轻量级ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B以适应资源受限场景。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes
empirical insight into the ongoing debate over prompting versus fine-tuning.

### [87] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于结构因果模型（SCM）的个体因果推理（ICI）方法，通过引入indiv-operator和个体因果查询来形式化个体化过程，旨在解决个体因果效应（ICE）估计中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果推理方法主要基于群体，难以直接应用于个体因果效应的估计。个体因果推理（ICI）旨在克服这一限制，通过考虑个体特定特征来预测干预效果。

Method: 论文提出使用结构因果模型（SCM）中的外生变量（U）编码个体差异，并引入indiv(W)操作符和个体因果查询P(Y|indiv(W),do(X),Z)来形式化个体化推理过程。

Result: 研究表明，基于SCM的ICI方法能够对个体可能的替代情况（individual alternatives）进行推理，而非非实际的个体反事实（individual counterfactuals）。

Conclusion: 通过SCM实现个体因果推理为个体化干预效果估计提供了新思路，扩展了因果推理在个体层面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需在目标与价值观多元的人类环境中决策，现有契约主义方法达成协议成本高、速度慢，需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用资源理性契约主义（RRC），结合规范性基础与认知启发式方法，在精度与效率间权衡，模拟理性多方协议。

Result: RRC框架使AI系统能低成本快速适应动态社会，同时保持决策的合理性与可解释性。

Conclusion: RRC为AI在复杂人类环境中的对齐问题提供了可扩展且高效的实现路径。

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂任务中缺乏长期学习机制且在动态环境中效率低下，需要一种更通用且高效的学习框架。

Method: 引入OmniReflect框架，采用自持和协作两种模式，结合神经、符号和神经符号技术构建指导原则。

Result: 实验显示任务成功率显著提升，自持模式下ALFWorld、BabyAI和PDDL分别提高10.3%、23.8%和8.3%，协作模式下轻量级代理表现优于基线。

Conclusion: OmniReflect在不同环境和模型上展现出强大的鲁棒性和有效性，为LLM代理学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体系统，将供应链支持票据转化为结构化知识库，显著提升RAG系统性能并减少无效响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链运营产生大量非结构化沟通数据（如支持票据、邮件等），现有RAG系统因数据噪声大、不一致且不完整而效果受限。传统方法聚焦运行时优化，但缺乏对原始数据的离线结构化处理。

Method: 采用离线优先方法，通过三个专用智能体（分类发现、票据分组、知识合成）将非结构化沟通数据转化为结构化知识库，大幅压缩数据量至原始3.4%。

Result: 实验显示该方法使RAG系统有用回答率提升至48.74%（传统方法38.60%），无效响应减少77.4%，并能自动解决约50%未来票据，显著提升运营效率。

Conclusion: 通过智能离线处理将瞬时沟通转化为可重用知识，解决了知识管理的关键缺口，实现支持工作量减少、解决时间加速和自我改进的系统。

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型的引用不可靠，依赖外部检索器会引入延迟和噪声。研究旨在通过改进训练过程，使模型能可靠引用预训练文档。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 持续预训练将事实与文档标识符绑定；2) 指令微调引导引用行为。提出主动索引方法，通过合成QA对增强训练。

Result: 主动索引在所有任务和模型上均优于被动索引，引用精确度最高提升30.2%。数据增强规模扩大时性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 主动索引能有效提升语言模型的引用可靠性，且性能随数据增强规模扩大而持续改善，为可信语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在网络安全竞赛（CTF）中的表现，发现LLM虽具备技术知识，但在实际应用中存在不足。为此，作者提出了CTFAgent框架，通过两阶段检索增强生成和环境交互增强，显著提升了LLM在CTF中的解题能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，人们对其在自动化解决CTF挑战中的能力产生了兴趣。然而，CTF解题需要从知识到推理再到行动的多方面能力，而LLM在将知识应用于具体场景和根据环境反馈调整策略方面表现不佳。因此，作者旨在通过构建专门的基准测试和改进框架来提升LLM在CTF中的表现。

Method: 作者首先构建了一个包含3,992个问题的CTFKnow基准测试，用于评估LLM在CTF知识理解和应用方面的能力。基于测试结果，他们提出了CTFAgent框架，该框架引入了两阶段检索增强生成（RAG）和交互式环境增强模块，分别用于提升LLM的技术知识和漏洞利用能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，CTFAgent在两个流行的CTF数据集上实现了超过80%的性能提升。此外，在CMU主办的picoCTF2024竞赛中，CTFAgent在近7,000支参赛队伍中排名前23.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅揭示了LLM在CTF解题中的局限性，还通过CTFAgent框架展示了提升LLM能力的潜力。这一框架为未来LLM在网络安全领域的应用提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于提示的解决方案依赖昂贵的封闭LLM API，而微调小型开源LLM的方法又受限于语法学习范式，导致分布外（OOD）脆弱性。ASL旨在解决这些限制。

Method: ASL框架通过定义动作语义为用户界面中的状态转换，并利用语义估计器（SEE）计算语义奖励，训练App代理生成语义一致的动作。

Result: 理论和实验表明，ASL在离线和在线智能手机App操作基准测试中显著提高了代理的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ASL通过语义学习范式有效提升了App代理的鲁棒性和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

Method: 提出包含两个关键组件的框架：(1) 下一步智能体预测（动态选择最合适的角色），(2) 下一步上下文选择（允许智能体选择性访问历史信息），构建任务自适应的通信管道。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在保持优异性能的同时显著降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: 序列化通信框架通过角色灵活性和全局信息流实现了更高效的多智能体协作，为动态拓扑空间探索提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在社交推理任务（如推断他人信念和意图）上表现有限，尤其在实时应用中性能下降明显，需要改进。

Method: 提出混合推理框架，将信念推断外化为结构化概率模型，同时利用大型语言模型进行语言理解和交互。

Result: 该方法在社交推理游戏Avalon中表现优异，击败人类玩家（67%胜率），并获得比基准模型和人类队友更高的评价。

Conclusion: 混合推理框架显著提升了语言模型在社交推理任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

*Alexandros Evangelidis,Gricel Vázquez,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态优化MDP策略合成的方法，显著提升了大规模状态空间下的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MDP策略合成方法在处理大规模状态空间时效率不足，难以满足实际需求。

Method: 通过动态细化MDP并迭代选择最脆弱区域进行优化，平衡精度与效率。

Result: 在百万级状态的MDP案例中，性能较PRISM模型检查器提升高达2倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模MDP的实际策略合成任务提供了高效且具竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

### [101] [Reflective Verbal Reward Design for Pluralistic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17834)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson,Edith Law*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化奖励建模方法，通过对话引导用户反思并构建偏好，取代传统聚合反馈的单一奖励模型，提升少数群体偏好准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法将人类反馈聚合为单一奖励模型，可能压制少数群体价值观差异。需解决个体价值观异质性问题。

Method: 使用语言模型引导用户进行反思对话，构建个性化偏好历史，并作为上下文输入另一个语言模型生成个性化奖励函数（'verbal reward model'）。

Result: 30人实验显示，该方法比非反思型语言奖励模型准确率提高9-12%，且样本效率优于传统监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 基于对话的个性化奖励建模能有效捕捉多元价值观，在准确性和效率上优于传统方法。

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

*Elija Perrier*

TL;DR: 该立场论文主张将形式最优控制理论作为AI对齐研究的核心，提出了一种分层对齐控制栈框架，以增强对前沿AI系统的安全性和可靠性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI安全和机制可解释性研究在泛化性和控制协议互操作性方面存在不足，需要一种更全面的框架来确保AI技术的可持续发展和社会效益。

Method: 通过形式最优控制原则重新构建对齐问题，并引入分层对齐控制栈，明确各层的测量和控制特性及其互操作性。

Result: 提出了一个分层对齐控制栈框架，为政府和监管机构提供了对前沿AI模型和代理系统控制的潜在能力和局限性的更好理解。

Conclusion: 将最优控制理论与实际部署考虑相结合，可以创建一个更全面的对齐框架，提升高级AI系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

Method: 采用包含声明分解、子查询生成、可信证据检索和可解释验证的四智能体系统架构，各智能体专业化分工协作完成事实核查全流程。

Result: 在FEVEROUS等基准测试集上取得12.3%的Macro F1分数提升，系统能有效分解复杂声明、获取可靠证据并生成可解释的验证结论。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化事实核查领域提供了兼具准确性、效率和透明度的解决方案，在保持可扩展性的同时更贴近人工核查实践。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能日志处理与自动调试框架LLM-ID，通过多阶段语义推理和强化学习策略，显著提升了云平台故障定位的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云平台AI系统规模和复杂度的增加，日志数据变得海量、非结构化和语义模糊，给故障定位和系统自修复带来了巨大挑战。

Method: LLM-ID扩展了预训练的Transformer模型，结合多阶段语义推理机制，包括日志动态结构化、无监督聚类和嵌入机制提取事件模板与语义模式，以及基于强化学习的策略引导恢复规划器。

Result: 在云平台日志数据集上的实验表明，LLM-ID将故障定位准确率提高了16.2%，显著优于当前主流方法。

Conclusion: LLM-ID框架在语义理解能力、持续学习能力和异构环境适应性方面优于现有规则引擎或传统日志分析系统，为云平台故障诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理系统存在依赖试错决策和评估指标过于简单的问题，无法有效学习和适应复杂的真实交互场景。

Method: CogniGUI框架采用双系统设计：1) 快速视觉语义分析的解析引擎；2) 基于相对奖励的GRPO策略优化代理，支持迭代学习循环。

Result: 实验表明CogniGUI在当前基准和新提出的ScreenSeek基准上均优于最先进方法，验证了其泛化性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过认知框架和综合基准推动了GUI自动化向类人自适应学习方向发展，解决了现有系统的关键局限。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的提示设计范式，通过将随机示例修剪为看似无意义的‘乱码’来提升大语言模型（LLM）的性能，并开发了一个自发现的提示优化框架PromptQuine。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖精心设计的指令和示例进行上下文学习（ICL），但该论文挑战这一观念，探索通过修剪示例为‘乱码’来提升性能的可能性。

Method: 提出PromptQuine框架，一种进化搜索算法，自动搜索有效的修剪策略，仅利用上下文中的令牌进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，‘乱码’提示在多种任务中表现优异，匹配或超越现有自动提示优化技术，且不受LLM对齐影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为上下文学习的机制研究提供了新方向，并呼吁开发更开放的搜索算法以优化LLM提示。

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Motivation: 药剂师角色正从药品分发转向提供全面的药学服务，需要准确、最新的药物信息支持。当前缺乏统一的药物信息库，导致药剂师依赖碎片化数据源。

Method: 通过整合英国国家处方集(BNF)、DrugBank和马耳他药品管理局(MMA)的数据，结合人工智能和语义技术构建知识图谱，并通过药剂师访谈确保实用性。

Result: medicX-KG能有效支持药物可用性、相互作用、不良反应和治疗类别的查询，但存在剂量编码不足和实时更新限制。

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动作语言在表达能力上与现代ASP语言存在差距，无法充分利用ASP的新特性（如选择规则、聚合等）。

Method: 基于命题公式的一般稳定模型语义定义BC+语言，将现代ASP构造映射为命题公式的简写形式。

Result: BC+能涵盖B、C、C+等动作语言的优秀特性，并可通过扩展ASP求解器实现计算。

Conclusion: BC+实现了动作语言与现代ASP的融合，其表达能力更强且计算可行。

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

Conclusion: SE-Merging通过动态任务识别和自适应合并系数调整，有效提升了模型合并的多任务能力，为模型合并机制的理解和应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出CoachGPT，一种基于大型语言模型的AI写作助手，旨在通过实时反馈和指导提升学术写作能力，弥补现有工具在教育和上下文理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术写作对学生的成功至关重要，但缺乏指导和资源的学生，尤其是非母语者，常感到困难。现有写作助手要么功能有限，要么成本高昂，且无法真正教授写作技巧。

Method: 开发CoachGPT，一个基于大型语言模型的AI代理网络应用，通过接收教育者指令、分解任务并提供实时反馈和建议，实现个性化写作辅导。

Result: 用户研究表明，CoachGPT提供了沉浸式的写作体验，其个性化反馈和指导功能显示出大型语言模型在学术写作中的潜力。

Conclusion: CoachGPT通过结合教育者指导和AI技术，为学术写作提供了有效的支持，展示了大型语言模型在教育领域的应用前景。

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLMs是否能够模拟人类的认知模式，特别是在叙事连贯性、框架偏差、道德判断和认知失调等方面，以增进对AI透明度和伦理部署的理解。

Method: 研究方法包括使用结构化提示和自动评分系统，评估多个专有和开源模型在四种心理学框架下的表现：主题统觉测试（TAT）、框架偏差、道德基础理论（MFT）和认知失调。

Result: 研究结果显示，这些模型能够生成连贯的叙事，易受正面框架影响，道德判断倾向于自由/压迫维度，并通过大量合理化来缓解自我矛盾。

Conclusion: 结论指出，LLMs的行为反映了人类认知倾向，但这些行为受其训练数据和调整方法的影响。研究强调了在AI透明度和伦理部署方面的重要性，并提出了未来结合认知心理学和AI安全的研究方向。

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

*Xinzge Gao,Chuanrui Hu,Bin Chen,Teng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Chain-of-Memory (CoM)方法，通过显式建模GUI代理的短期和长期记忆，提升跨应用任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理依赖历史截图或动作隐式表示任务状态，难以准确理解复杂跨应用任务状态，缺乏有效机制存储关键信息。

Method: CoM通过捕获动作描述、整合任务相关屏幕信息，并维护专用内存模块存储管理信息，显式建模记忆。

Result: 实验表明CoM显著提升GUI代理在跨应用任务中的性能，7B模型可实现与72B模型相当的记忆管理能力。

Conclusion: CoM方法有效解决了GUI代理在复杂任务中的状态理解和信息存储问题，相关数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了推理语言模型的不确定性量化问题，发现模型通常过于自信，尤其是错误答案的置信度常超过85%。通过自省方法可改善部分模型的校准，但效果不统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型在多步推理任务中表现出色，但仍存在生成错误但自信的答案（幻觉）问题。为确保模型在实际应用中的安全部署，研究其不确定性量化至关重要。

Method: 论文提出自省不确定性量化（UQ）方法，通过模型对其推理链的显式反思来评估校准性，并在多个SOTA推理模型和基准测试中进行广泛评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 推理模型普遍过于自信，错误答案的置信度常高于85%；(2) 更深层推理会加剧过度自信；(3) 自省可改善部分模型（如o3-Mini和DeepSeek R1）的校准性，但并非所有模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet校准性反而下降）。

Conclusion: 论文强调需设计更完善的UQ基准测试以提升推理模型的校准性，并指出自省方法的潜力与局限性。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Pim Welle,Jeremy C. Weiss,George H. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究量化了精神分裂症患者不坚持服用抗精神病药物与不良后果之间的关联，发现不坚持用药会使不良后果提前1至4个月发生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估精神分裂症患者不坚持用药对不良后果（如早逝、强制住院、入狱）的影响，为临床和政策制定提供依据。

Method: 采用生存分析方法，结合因果推断技术（T-learner、S-learner、最近邻匹配）和不同时间跨度的纵向数据（3、6、9、12个月）进行分析。

Result: 研究发现不坚持用药显著提前不良后果1至4个月，且不同药物类型和剂型（注射vs口服）的结果一致。

Conclusion: 坚持用药对延缓精神危机至关重要，生存分析与因果推断结合可为政策提供见解，但需注意因果解释的假设限制。

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

Motivation: 随着AI系统的发展和社会整合，透明且设计良好的评估成为AI治理的重要工具，但目前缺乏全面可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出一个结构化的描述性框架，系统化分析广泛使用的评估方法和术语，不引入新分类或固定格式。

Result: 该框架帮助研究者识别方法缺陷，支持从业者设计评估，并为政策制定者提供审查和比较复杂评估的工具。

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and
transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance,
informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型扩展的第四维度——虚拟逻辑深度（VLD），研究参数复用对模型性能的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 通过精心设计的对照实验，研究VLD扩展对模型知识容量和推理能力的影响，验证不同模型配置下的普适性。

Result: VLD扩展能保持知识容量基本不变，显著提升推理能力；参数量与知识容量相关，但与推理能力无关。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，无需增加参数量即可通过VLD扩展提升模型推理能力，这一发现在实验范围内具有普适性。

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

Method: 提出IDVSCI框架，包含动态知识交换机制和双多样性评审范式，促进智能体间的深度推理和创意生成。

Result: 在计算机科学和健康科学数据集上，IDVSCI表现优于现有系统，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模拟交互和同行评审动态对基于大语言模型的自主研究具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在模拟电路预布局阶段的器件尺寸设计中，通常将电路尺寸任务作为数学优化问题来解决，但忽视了先验知识的自动引入，未能有效剪枝搜索空间，导致搜索空间存在较大压缩空间。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，用于从学术论文中提取模拟电路的尺寸关系，从而在尺寸设计过程中有效剪枝搜索空间。

Result: 在3种电路上的测试表明，优化效率提升了2.32到26.6倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了大语言模型可以有效剪枝模拟电路尺寸设计的搜索空间，为LLM与传统模拟电路设计自动化方法的结合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

*Feng He,Zhenyang Liu,Marco Valentino,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，模型编辑后的修改在微调过程中往往无法保留，这对AI安全性和长期控制提出了挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨模型编辑后修改在微调过程中的持久性，以评估其对AI安全性和应用的潜在影响。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX两种T2I模型家族上，结合两种编辑技术和三种微调方法进行系统性实验分析。

Result: 编辑后的修改在微调中普遍失效，DoRA表现出最强的修改逆转效果，而UCE编辑方法相对更稳健。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法存在局限性，需开发更稳健的技术以确保AI系统的长期控制和安全性。

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗器械合规性中，确定适用的监管标准是一个关键但研究不足的挑战，通常需要专家解读分散且异构的文档。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）管道，通过检索候选标准并利用大语言模型推断特定司法管辖区的适用性（强制性、推荐或不适用），并提供可追溯的 justification。

Result: 系统在标准分类准确率达到73%，Top-5检索召回率为87%，能够有效识别相关监管标准。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了端到端的标准适用性推理系统，为可扩展且可解释的AI支持监管科学提供了支持，特别是在跨司法管辖区的标准冲突解决方面表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

Abstract: Ensuring diversity and inclusion (D&I) in artificial intelligence (AI) is
crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However,
existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为T-CPDL的新框架，结合时间、因果和概率逻辑，显著提升语言模型在结构化推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在涉及时间约束、因果关系和概率推理的结构化推理任务中表现不佳，需要一种能整合这些要素的逻辑框架来增强其推理能力。

Method: 扩展传统描述逻辑，引入时间区间算子、显式因果关系和概率标注，提出两种T-CPDL变体：一种基于Allen区间代数，另一种支持带时间戳的因果断言。

Result: 实验表明T-CPDL显著提高了时间推理和因果推断任务的准确性、可解释性和置信度校准，为语言模型提供了透明推理路径和细粒度语义支持。

Conclusion: T-CPDL为开发逻辑检索增强生成框架（Logic-RAG）奠定基础，有望提升知识图谱增强系统的推理能力与效率。

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language

temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially

Conclusion: Airalogy通过社区与AI协同，突破学科壁垒，有望推动全球科研自动化进程。

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AggTruth方法通过分析注意力分数分布，有效检测LLMs在RAG中的幻觉问题，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在实际应用中常产生幻觉，即使在检索增强生成（RAG）设置中，这对其部署构成挑战。

Method: 提出AggTruth方法，通过分析上下文（段落）内部注意力分数的分布，采用四种不同的聚合技术变体进行在线幻觉检测。

Result: AggTruth在所有测试的LLMs中表现稳定，在相同任务和跨任务设置中均优于当前最优方法，且注意力头的选择对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: AggTruth通过优化注意力头选择，显著提升了幻觉检测的准确性和稳定性，为LLMs的可靠部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为DLBC的新型多智能体强化学习方法，通过动态调节组内和组间行为多样性，提升组内合作和组间任务专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注多智能体系统中的组内行为一致性，而对多智能体分组场景中的行为一致性研究较少。因此，论文旨在填补这一空白，探索如何在组内和组间层面同时调控行为一致性。

Method: 论文提出Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC)方法，通过将智能体分组并动态调节组内和组间的行为多样性，实现组间一致性和组内一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DLBC在多种分组合作场景中显著提升了组内合作性能和组间任务专业化，带来了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DLBC为多智能体系统的行为一致性控制提供了新思路，未来可进一步探索其在更复杂任务和动态环境中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出通过反向传播编程（PBB）训练大语言模型（LLM）仅用源代码（无输入输出示例）学习程序评估能力，发现其能内化算法抽象并提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型通过源代码训练提升通用推理能力的机制，尤其是仅用源代码（无I/O示例）时模型如何学习程序评估。

Method: 微调LLM对比两组程序（数学问题与算法）：一组含源代码和I/O示例（w/ IO），另一组仅含源代码（w/o IO），测试模型对w/o IO程序的评估能力。

Result: 发现：1) PBB在代码形式下效果显著优于语义描述；2) LLM可通过前向传播隐式评估程序，链式思考（CoT）能提升可靠性；3) PBB比基于数据分布的I/O训练更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 代码训练使LLM内化可复用的算法抽象，从而增强推理能力。未来需进一步优化模型从符号化过程中学习的效果，可能拓展至基于形式化原则的模型对齐。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了去中心化问题解决在复杂创新任务中的优势，为AI驱动的创新未来提供了新方向。

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

*Siao Tang,Xinyin Ma,Gongfan Fang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出ConciseHint框架，通过在推理过程中注入文本提示，有效减少大型推理模型的冗余输出，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1、Qwen-3）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但常产生冗长的推理过程，导致效率低下。当前研究多关注推理前优化（如提示或微调），而忽略了在推理生成过程中直接干预的潜力。

Method: 提出ConciseHint框架，在模型生成推理过程中动态注入文本提示（手动设计或基于简洁数据训练），并根据问题复杂度自适应调整提示强度，以平衡简洁性与准确性。

Result: 在GSM8K等基准测试中，ConciseHint将Qwen-3 4B模型的推理长度减少65%，且几乎无精度损失。该方法在DeepSeek-R1等先进模型上同样有效。

Conclusion: ConciseHint通过实时干预推理生成过程，显著提升大型推理模型的输出效率，为平衡模型性能与计算资源消耗提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

TL;DR: 该研究通过激活语言模型中的潜在子空间，开发了一种梯度优化的自适应激活引导框架（G-ACT），成功将科学代码生成引导至特定编程语言，提高了分类准确率并减少了推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索是否可以通过激活语言模型中的潜在子空间，来引导科学代码生成偏向特定的编程语言，以解决现有方法在泛化性和模型规模适应性上的不足。

Method: 研究方法包括评估五个因果语言模型在科学编码提示上的基线偏差，开发梯度优化的自适应激活引导框架（G-ACT），通过聚类激活差异和在线训练轻量级探针来选择引导向量。

Result: 研究结果显示，G-ACT框架在LLaMA-3.2 3B模型中显著提高了CPP语言的生成偏向，探针分类准确率平均提升15%，早期层提升61.5%。在LLaMA-3.3 70B模型中，关键层的定向注入仍能改善语言选择。

Conclusion: 研究结论是G-ACT框架提供了一种可扩展、可解释且高效的概念级控制机制，适用于实际的代理系统，尽管每层探针引入了一定的推理开销，但通过仅引导部分层仍保持实用性。

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Vision Transformers的无监督域自适应方法在特征对齐方面表现良好，但存在前景对象大小和空间分布不一致的问题，这削弱了注意力一致性并影响了域对齐效果。

Method: 论文提出了渐进式聚焦跨注意力机制（PCaM），逐步过滤背景信息，聚焦并融合跨域的判别性前景语义；同时引入注意力引导损失，显式引导注意力至任务相关区域。

Result: 在Office-Home、DomainNet、VisDA-2017和遥感数据集上的实验表明，PCaM显著提升了自适应性能，并达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PCaM通过注意力引导的前景融合有效解决了域自适应中的前景对象不匹配问题，验证了其在提升跨域注意力一致性和性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

TL;DR: MLBuf-RePlAce是一种基于学习的虚拟缓冲感知全局布局框架，显著提升了时序收敛性能，同时保持布线后功耗不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代技术节点中互连延迟与单元延迟的不均衡缩放使得具有缓冲孔隙率（即单元密度）意识的布局对时序收敛至关重要。现有方法存在计算成本高或未充分考虑电气规则检查（ERC）违规的问题。

Method: MLBuf-RePlAce采用基于递归学习生成的缓冲方法，预测缓冲器类型和位置，并在全局布局阶段解决ERC违规问题。该框架构建在OpenROAD基础设施之上。

Result: 在开源OpenROAD流程中，MLBuf-RePlAce在总负松弛时间（TNS）上实现了最大56%、平均31%的改进，且未降低布线后功耗。在商业流程中，TNS改进最大53%、平均28%，平均功耗提升0.2%。

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce是首个开源的、学习驱动的虚拟缓冲感知全局布局框架，有效解决了时序收敛问题，同时保持功耗稳定，具有显著的性能优势。

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于CAP分数的早期退出方法，通过整合logits和NSP分数来提升预测确定性估计，从而在保持性能的同时显著加速PLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期退出方法主要依赖类别相关logits作为退出信号，忽略了特征中类别无关信息对预测确定性的负面影响，导致对预测确定性的高估和样本过早退出。

Method: 提出NSP分数来估计特征中类别无关信息的比例，并基于此设计CAP分数，结合logits和NSP分数来增强预测确定性估计，从而做出更可靠的退出决策。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，该方法实现了2.19倍的平均加速比，性能损失可忽略，优于当前最佳方法ConsistentEE 28%，在任务性能和推理效率之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过考虑类别无关信息的影响，CAP分数能更准确地估计预测确定性，显著提升早期退出方法的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE
benchmark show that our method can achieve an average speed-up ratio of 2.19x
across all tasks with negligible performance degradation, surpassing the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) ConsistentEE by 28%, yielding a better trade-off
between task performance and inference efficiency. The code is available at

*Fudong Lin,Jiadong Lou,Hao Wang,Brian Jalaian,Xu Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的稀疏攻击方法，通过优化初始扰动的幅度和稀疏性，克服了现有方法在计算开销、可转移性和攻击强度上的不足，同时增强了对抗样本的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏攻击方法在解释深度神经网络（DNNs）的脆弱性时，由于稀疏性不足、计算开销大、可转移性差和攻击强度弱等问题，难以生成可解释的对抗样本。因此，论文旨在开发一种新的稀疏攻击方法，以更好地理解卷积神经网络（CNNs）的脆弱性。

Method: 论文提出了一种理论上有依据的参数化技术，用于近似NP难的l0优化问题，使得直接优化稀疏扰动在计算上可行。此外，设计了一种新的损失函数，通过最大化对抗性和最小化扰动像素数量来增强初始扰动。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在计算开销、可转移性和攻击强度上优于现有的稀疏攻击方法，并生成了更稀疏的对抗样本。此外，还发现了两种噪声类型（“遮蔽噪声”和“引导噪声”），有助于解释对抗扰动如何误导分类器。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的稀疏攻击方法不仅克服了现有方法的不足，还增强了对抗样本的可解释性，为评估DNNs的鲁棒性提供了新的基准。

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

*Dongseok Lee,Jimyung Hong,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Referi的新框架，通过复用少量示例来验证LLM输出，无需额外训练即可显著提升模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程具有随机性，导致输出结论不一致。现有方法如多数投票或外部验证模型存在适用性有限或额外训练成本的问题。

Method: Referi框架利用少量示例评估候选输出，结合两种基于贝叶斯规则的评分，通过少量额外LLM推理选择置信度高且上下文连贯的答案。

Result: 在三个不同LLM和七项任务上的实验表明，该框架平均提升4.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: Referi通过有效响应选择显著提升LLM性能，且无需额外训练成本。

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SamS的样本调度算法，用于动态优化DPO训练过程中的样本选择，显著提升模型性能且计算开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖高质量人类偏好数据，但数据选择策略常忽略模型在训练过程中的动态变化，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出SamS算法，根据模型学习状态动态调整训练样本，无需修改DPO核心算法即可实现自适应样本调度。

Result: 在多项任务中显著提升模型对齐性能，且额外计算成本极低。

Conclusion: 通过更高效利用固定偏好数据集，为LLM对齐研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

*Shaoang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为StageRoute的分层算法，用于在大型语言模型（LLM）服务中优化模型部署和查询路由，以应对模型快速更新和资源限制的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的快速更新和旧模型的迅速过时，迫使服务提供商在有限的部署容量和查询成本预算下，高效管理不断变化的模型库存。

Method: StageRoute算法分两步：(i) 在固定维护窗口内，使用奖励上界和成本下界乐观选择最多M_max个模型；(ii) 通过预算约束的bandit子问题为每个查询路由到合适的模型。

Result: 理论证明StageRoute的遗憾度为T^{2/3}，并提供了匹配的下界，表明其接近最优。实验验证了算法在实际场景中的优异表现。

Conclusion: StageRoute是一种高效且接近最优的算法，适用于LLM服务中的模型部署和查询路由问题，能够有效应对资源限制和模型更新的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型(LLM)快速增长超出边缘设备内存限制，需要突破1比特极限的压缩方法。现有方法存在内存开销大或精度损失严重的问题。

Method: 采用无索引草图框架，结合低估AbsMaxMin草图最小化小权重误差、重要性感知空间分配和直通估计器进行压缩感知微调。

Result: 在Llama-3.2-1B上实现0.5比特/权重压缩，保持竞争力困惑度，延迟开销可接受。

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM为资源受限环境部署LLM提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索ONH生物力学特性是否能提高对青光眼进展性视野缺损模式的预测能力，并通过可解释AI识别影响预测的关键ONH区域。

Method: 研究纳入237名青光眼患者，通过两种眼压条件下的ONH成像，结合自动组织分割和数字体积相关技术计算应变。使用几何深度学习模型处理生物力学和结构特征，进行三种视野缺损分类任务，并采用可解释AI技术分析关键区域。

Result: 模型AUC达0.77-0.88，证实ONH应变可提升预测性能。下部和下颞侧视盘边缘被识别为关键应变敏感区域，其贡献随疾病严重程度增加而扩大。

Conclusion: ONH应变增强了青光眼视野缺损模式的预测能力，神经视网膜边缘（而非筛板）是模型预测中最关键的生物力学敏感区域。

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

Motivation: 资源限制会改变学习和决策过程，特别是在内存受限的情况下，智能体需要在模型估计和规划之间权衡内存分配。

Method: 使用基于MCTS和DQN的算法，分析不同内存分配在情景学习和持续学习中的性能影响。

Result: 不同内存分配策略对智能体性能有显著影响，尤其是在模型估计和规划之间的权衡上。

Conclusion: 内存限制下，合理分配内存对智能体的学习和决策性能至关重要。

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

Motivation: 零阶优化（ZO）虽节省内存，但收敛慢且优化不稳定。本文旨在通过优化感知的数据重述策略改善ZO微调效果。

Method: 提出OAT-Rephrase策略，利用LLM根据ZO动态重述训练数据，并通过双阶段流程（重写LLM和语义判断）确保任务相关性和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在五个分类任务和三种LLM架构上的评估表明，OAT-Rephrase显著提升MeZO微调性能，常缩小或消除与一阶方法的差距。

Conclusion: 优化感知的重述策略是零阶调优的可复用、低开销增强方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）遗忘敏感信息的新型攻击方法——隐蔽遗忘攻击（SUA），通过生成通用噪声模式来恢复模型中被遗忘的知识，实验证明该方法有效且具有泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆敏感个人信息，现有遗忘方法虽能减少模型输出这些信息，但无法确认知识是否真正被遗忘或仅被隐藏。因此，研究如何恢复被遗忘的知识具有重要隐私意义。

Method: 提出SUA框架，学习一种通用噪声模式，该噪声应用于输入图像时可触发模型输出被遗忘内容。为提高隐蔽性，引入嵌入对齐损失函数，最小化扰动图像与去噪图像在语义嵌入空间的差异。

Result: 实验表明SUA能有效恢复MLLMs中被遗忘的信息，且学习的噪声具有良好泛化性，单个噪声模式可揭示未见图像中的遗忘内容，表明知识重现是模型的一致行为而非偶然。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs遗忘方法的潜在漏洞，表明被遗忘的知识可能仍存在于模型中，仅通过简单遗忘无法彻底消除隐私风险，需进一步研究更可靠的遗忘机制。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

Result: CF-VLM在组合推理和泛化基准测试中持续优于基线方法，并显示出减少视觉幻觉的潜力。

Conclusion: CF-VLM为需要可靠推理和可解释性的高风险现实场景提供了鲁棒的视觉语言模型基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

### [156] [Learning to Adapt Frozen CLIP for Few-Shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17307)

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过在输入空间学习来补充冻结CLIP的特定数据集知识，显著提升了小样本测试时域适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖CLIP的强分布外能力，但仅依赖特征空间知识受限于CLIP的先验知识，特别是在使用不太鲁棒的骨干网络时性能显著下降。

Method: 提出了一种独立侧分支与CLIP并行的方法，通过反向注意力学习专属知识，并采用贪婪文本集成和细化增强文本特征，最后通过生成的域提示逐步融合文本和视觉特征。

Result: 在5个大规模基准测试（WILDS和DomainNet）上表现出色，特别是在ViT-B/16等较小网络上显著提升，如iWildCam的F1提高5.1，FMoW的WC Acc提高3.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过输入空间学习有效补充了CLIP的特定数据集知识，显著提升了小样本测试时域适应的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,
GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the
CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant

Motivation: 随着扩散模型成为图像生成的首选工具，理解其创造性来源变得尤为重要。现有理论未能解释自注意力在扩散模型中的作用，因此需要进一步研究。

Method: 论文扩展了现有理论，研究了由CNN和自注意力层参数化的扩散模型，通过理论分析和实验验证自注意力对图像全局一致性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，自注意力机制能够超越局部特征，生成具有全局一致性的图像，并通过精心设计的数据集验证了这一行为。

Conclusion: 自注意力在扩散模型中起到了关键作用，能够促进生成图像的全局一致性，为理解扩散模型的创造性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病对全球健康构成重大威胁，早期检测能有效降低风险。尽管机器学习在糖尿病识别方面取得进展，但数据不平衡问题仍影响模型效果。

Method: 研究采用A2 copula生成少数类数据以保持依赖结构，并应用逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和XGBoost四种算法进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，XGBoost结合A2 copula过采样在准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和AUC上分别提升4.6%、15.6%、20.4%、18.2%和25.5%，且通过McNemar检验验证了统计显著性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将A2 copula用于数据增强，证明了其作为SMOTE替代方案的有效性，凸显了copula在机器学习中的统计价值。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞自动机（CA）是研究局部相互作用如何产生复杂时空行为的理想工具，但自动发现其局部更新规则并用于定量预测仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出AutomataGPT，一个基于100种二维二进制确定性CA规则生成的100万条模拟轨迹预训练的仅解码器Transformer模型。

Result: AutomataGPT在未见过的CA规则上实现了98.5%的一步预测准确率，规则重建功能准确率达96%，规则矩阵匹配准确率达82%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大规模预训练能在无手工先验的情况下显著提升CA的前向预测和逆向推理能力，为现实世界动力学现象的CA建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Method: 提出基于联邦多智能体近端策略优化（F-MAPPO）的自适应流媒体系统ASMS。

Result: ASMS在各种网络条件下比现有方法提升用户体验至少14%。

Conclusion: ASMS在动态和资源受限网络中提供无缝沉浸式流媒体，同时保护用户数据隐私。

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

Motivation: 地下储氢（UHS）是低碳经济转型中的重要能源存储方式，快速模拟氢羽流迁移和压力场演变对UHS现场管理至关重要。

Method: 提出新的神经网络算子架构FFINO，参数化文献中的相对渗透率曲线，并将其作为关键不确定性参数纳入模型，与FMIONet模型进行多维度对比。

Result: FFINO模型可训练参数减少38.1%，训练时间降低17.6%，GPU内存消耗减少12%，在重点区域氢羽流预测精度提高9.8%，推理速度比数值模拟器快7850倍。

Conclusion: FFINO模型凭借卓越的时间效率和准确性，成为UHS问题数值模拟的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于混合专家（MoE）架构的大语言模型在安全对齐方面的独特挑战，提出了一个名为SAFEx的分析框架，用于识别和验证安全关键专家模块，并发现仅禁用少量专家即可显著降低模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全对齐策略主要针对密集模型设计，无法有效应对MoE架构特有的安全漏洞。MoE模型的位置脆弱性现象表明，安全对齐行为依赖于特定的专家模块，这带来了关键风险。

Method: 论文提出了SAFEx框架，采用基于稳定性的专家选择（SES）算法，系统地识别、表征和验证安全关键专家模块，并将其分解为不同的功能组。

Result: 实验表明，主流MoE模型（如Qwen3-MoE）的安全机制高度依赖少数位置专家。例如，禁用Qwen3-MoE中仅12个安全关键专家即可使拒绝有害请求的比率下降22%。

Conclusion: MoE模型的安全性依赖于少数专家模块，禁用这些模块会显著削弱模型的安全性能，凸显了MoE架构在安全对齐方面的独特挑战。

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型中的推理时计算技术（如解码时缩放和自我优化）是否同样适用于视觉语言模型，特别是那些通过强化学习训练的模型。

Method: 通过广泛的实验，在推理时缩放框架内评估不同解码策略（如多数投票和最佳选择）及自我验证行为对视觉语言模型性能的影响。

Result: 依赖生成的方法（如多数投票）比依赖验证的方法（如最佳选择）带来更高的性能提升，强化学习调优的自校正行为未显著改善模型性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练的视觉语言模型在视觉和文本模态上仍缺乏稳健的自我验证能力，这是性能提升受限的关键原因。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Conclusion: FedNAMs有效平衡了隐私保护、模型效能和可解释性需求，为需要高透明度的应用场景提供了新解决方案，并能识别高低可解释性特征的形成原因。

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

Conclusion: 通过结合推理时微调和优化元学习框架，基于度量的模型能够快速适应有限的支持样本，同时避免过拟合，从而在小样本分类任务中取得更好的性能。

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

Abstract: Representation learning methods are an important tool for addressing the
challenges posed by complex observations spaces in sequential decision making
problems. Recently, many methods have used a wide variety of types of
approaches for learning meaningful state representations in reinforcement
learning, allowing better sample efficiency, generalization, and performance.
This survey aims to provide a broad categorization of these methods within a
model-free online setting, exploring how they tackle the learning of state
representations differently. We categorize the methods into six main classes,

### [169] [Predicting E-commerce Purchase Behavior using a DQN-Inspired Deep Learning Model for enhanced adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17543)
*Aditi Madhusudan Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合深度Q网络（DQN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）的新方法，用于预测电子商务中的购买意图和产品需求，在88万次用户会话数据上实现了88%的准确率和0.88的AUC-ROC分数。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

### [172] [Towards Deeper GCNs: Alleviating Over-smoothing via Iterative Training and Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17576)
*Furong Peng,Jinzhen Gao,Xuan Lu,Kang Liu,Yifan Huo,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文发现图卷积网络（GCNs）中可训练的线性变换会加剧深度架构中的特征崩溃问题，提出了一种名为Layer-wise Gradual Training（LGT）的新训练策略，通过逐步构建深度GCN并保持其表达能力，显著提升了深层网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的研究主要将GCNs在深度架构中的性能下降归因于图拉普拉斯算子的重复应用，但本文通过实证分析发现，可训练的线性变换在GCNs中会显著加剧特征崩溃问题，尤其是在中等深度（如8层）时。这一发现促使作者提出新的训练策略来解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了Layer-wise Gradual Training（LGT）策略，包含三个互补组件：1）逐层训练以稳定从浅层到深层的优化；2）低秩适应以微调浅层并加速训练；3）恒等初始化以确保新层的平滑集成并加速收敛。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，LGT在普通GCN上实现了最先进的性能，即使在32层设置下也能显著提高准确性。此外，LGT作为一种训练方法，可以与PairNorm和ContraNorm等现有方法无缝结合，进一步提升深层网络的性能。

Conclusion: LGT为可扩展的深度GCN提供了一个通用的、与架构无关的训练框架，有效解决了深度GCN中的特征崩溃问题，同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型物理信息神经算子LFR-PINO，通过分层超网络架构和频域降维策略，显著提升了参数化偏微分方程求解的效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解决参数化偏微分方程时，要么因固定基/系数设计导致表达能力有限，要么因参数到权重映射空间的高维度而面临计算挑战。

Method: LFR-PINO引入了分层超网络架构和频域降维策略，前者为每层网络生成专用参数，后者减少参数数量同时保留关键频谱特征。

Result: 在四个代表性PDE问题上，LFR-PINO相比现有技术实现了22.8%-68.7%的误差降低，内存使用减少了28.6%-69.3%。

Conclusion: LFR-PINO在计算效率和求解精度之间取得了最优平衡，为通用PDE求解器的预训练和微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了主动多分布学习问题，提出了新算法并改进了标签复杂度的上下界，分别在分布依赖和分布无关的设置中取得了进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多分布学习在协作学习、公平性和鲁棒性等领域有广泛应用。尽管被动多分布学习的样本复杂度已有较完整的研究，主动多分布学习的研究仍较少，且现有算法的优劣性尚不明确。

Method: 论文开发了新的主动多分布学习算法，并建立了改进的标签复杂度上下界，包括分布依赖和分布无关的设置。

Result: 在近可实现设置中，论文证明了可实现和不可知设置中的上界分别为Õ(θ_max(d+k)ln(1/ε))和Õ(θ_max(d+k)(ln(1/ε)+ν²/ε²)+kν/ε²)，并展示了可实现设置中的边界在信息论上是最优的。

Conclusion: 论文不仅为主动多分布学习提供了新的算法和复杂度边界，还展示了这些边界的最优性和基础性，为未来的研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EQuARX的动态块级量化AllReduce方法，用于优化TPU上的LLM部署，显著提升了通信效率并减少了质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的部署面临巨大挑战，尤其是跨设备通信（如AllReduce）带来的性能开销。量化虽能减少计算和内存需求，但直接应用于通信操作会导致数值不稳定或误差累积。

Method: 在XLA编译器中为TPU设计了原生动态块级高效量化AllReduce（EQuARX），结合TPU友好的量化技术和通信-计算深度流水线，使用int8精度优化通信效率。

Result: EQuARX在int8精度下比BF16 AllReduce快1.8倍，并在Gemma 3 27B和12B模型的预填充阶段分别实现了1.25倍和1.1倍的加速，且对模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: EQuARX通过量化技术显著提升了TPU上LLM的通信效率，为高效部署大规模模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有慢性病风险评估模型多依赖医疗检测数据，限制了自我评估的可行性，且缺乏对模型解释性的医学验证，影响了公众信任。

Method: 使用个人和生活方式因素构建深度学习模型，采用SHAP方法解释模型特征，并与医学文献对比验证。

Result: 模型的关键特征与医学文献高度一致，验证了其在13种慢性病预测中的可信度。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发可信的自我预防性机器学习工具奠定了基础，未来需进一步探索模型可信度及伦理使用。

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在实时环境中的广泛应用，动态深度学习系统（DDLS）因其输入自适应计算能力而受到青睐。然而，这种动态性带来了未被充分探索的安全风险，特别是输入依赖的执行路径可能被攻击者利用，导致效率下降甚至拒绝服务。

Method: 本文通过调查现有攻击策略，识别新兴模型架构中的安全漏洞和现有防御机制的局限性，并在此基础上探讨现代DDLS效率攻击的可行性，开发针对性防御措施。

Result: 研究发现，当前DDLS存在效率漏洞，易受对抗性输入攻击，且现有防御机制覆盖不足。

Conclusion: 动态深度学习系统需加强安全防护，以在对抗条件下保持鲁棒性。本文为未来研究和防御策略提供了重要方向。

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

Method: 构建统一的文本提示范式（包含可学习软提示和文本化硬提示），设计语义空间嵌入和跨模态对齐模块，实现时间与文本信息的跨模态融合。

Result: 在6个公共数据集和3个碳排放数据集上的综合评估表明，LLM-Prompt是一个强大的时间序列预测框架。

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt通过整合多提示信息和跨模态对齐，显著提升了基于大语言模型的时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

TL;DR: 论文提出FaithfulSAE方法，通过使用模型自身生成的合成数据集训练稀疏自编码器（SAE），解决了传统SAE因依赖外部数据集导致的特征不稳定和虚假特征问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）在分解大语言模型表示时存在两个问题：1）不同初始化种子下结果不稳定；2）可能无法捕捉模型内部特征。这些问题源于训练数据来自外部（如网络或其他模型生成），可能包含超出模型泛化能力的分布外（OOD）数据，导致虚假特征。

Method: 提出FaithfulSAE方法，改用模型自身合成的指令数据集训练SAE，减少OOD数据的影响。

Result: 实验表明：1）FaithfulSAE在不同种子下更稳定；2）在SAE探测任务中优于基于网络数据训练的SAE；3）在7个模型中有5个表现出更低的虚假特征比例。

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE摆脱了对外部数据的依赖，能更准确地捕捉模型内部特征，同时揭示了SAE训练数据集的重要性常被忽视的问题，推动了模型可解释性研究。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach to predict true
stress-strain curves of high-strength steels from small punch test (SPT)
load-displacement data. The proposed approach uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF)

spatial-temporal features and employs a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model
with an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by multi-head
cross-attention to improved accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy, with minimum and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了图神经网络（GNN）在模型提取攻击（MEAs）中的脆弱性，并提出了一种节点查询策略，用于在限制条件下高效获取GNN模型，同时支持低资源研究环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图神经网络（GNN）的广泛应用和复杂化，其部署在机器学习即服务（MLaaS）平台上时面临模型提取攻击（MEAs）的安全威胁。同时，在非对抗性研究环境中，高效获取GNN模型的需求也日益增长，尤其是在标注成本高昂的领域（如生物医学）。

Method: 论文提出了一种节点查询策略，适用于批量查询被禁止且初始节点有限的场景。该方法通过多轮学习周期迭代优化节点选择机制，利用历史反馈提高提取效率。

Result: 在基准图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在严格的查询大小限制下，在准确性、保真度和F1分数上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅揭示了部署GNN模型易受提取攻击的脆弱性，也展示了伦理且高效的GNN获取方法在支持低资源研究环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

TL;DR: 提出SYNC方法，通过时间感知因果模型解决动态场景中的分布偏移问题，提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中数据分布持续变化，现有方法易受伪相关干扰，需捕捉动态因果机制以提升泛化性。

Method: 结合时序VAE框架与信息论目标，学习跨域/域内因果表征，理论证明其最优性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了SYNC的优越时序泛化性能。

Conclusion: SYNC通过动态因果建模有效解决了演化域泛化问题。

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

Motivation: 退役电动汽车电池在低碳能源系统中具有巨大潜力，但其退化行为的不确定性和数据获取困难阻碍了其安全、可扩展的部署。

Method: 论文提出了一种物理信息专家混合网络（PIMOE），利用部分现场可访问信号在单个周期内计算电池退化轨迹，结合容量-电压和松弛数据进行多退化预测。

Result: PIMOE在207个电池、77种使用条件和67,902个周期上验证，平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）为0.88%，推理时间为0.43毫秒，比现有技术减少50%的计算时间和误差。

Conclusion: PIMOE框架为电池退化轨迹计算提供了一种可部署、无需历史数据的解决方案，重新定义了退役电池在可持续能源系统中的评估、优化和集成方式。

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Motivation: 当前光谱分析方法存在单模态依赖、泛化性差和可解释性不足等问题，需要一种更灵活且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

Motivation: 受生物神经网络在不可靠突触传递下仍能稳定工作的启发，研究是否能在人工神经网络中设计类似的乘法训练机制。

Method: 通过贝叶斯学习规则推导出对数正态后验权重分布，提出Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics（LMD）算法，结合乘性噪声和正则化进行权重更新。

Result: LMD算法在低精度前向运算下，成功实现了Vision Transformer和GPT-2的稳定训练，且易于实现（类似Adam）。

Conclusion: 生物启发的乘性动态特性可能为未来高效能硬件上的低精度推理与学习提供稳定解决方案。

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

<details>

Motivation: 当前基础模型在视频、图像和语言领域取得了显著成功，但在物理模拟领域由于数据稀缺和尺度多样性问题进展缓慢。

Method: PhysiX是一个45亿参数的自回归生成模型，使用离散标记器编码不同尺度的物理过程，并通过自回归预测目标建模。

Conclusion: 跨多任务联合训练可实现协同学习，PhysiX成功解决了物理模拟领域的数据瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

Conclusion: MoTE方法在不改变现有系统架构的前提下，显著提升了低容量模型在嵌入专业化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

Result: SING在状态推断和漂移函数估计上优于现有方法，适用于复杂动态系统。

Conclusion: SING为缺乏先验知识和非共轭结构的动态系统提供了准确推断工具。

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了生成式解决方案的潜力，尤其是在已知任务上生成参数的能力，但也揭示了其在未见任务上泛化的局限性。

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

Conclusion: 提出的平坦度度量方法在评估神经网络泛化能力方面具有鲁棒性，尤其适用于非过度自信的模型。

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于超图的因果框架HGCNet，用于研究批量大小在图和文本领域中如何通过梯度噪声、极小值锐度和模型复杂度影响泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注视觉任务中批量大小对泛化的影响，而在图和文本领域中的因果机制尚未深入探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供可解释的因果分析。

Method: HGCNet利用深度结构因果模型（DSCMs）和超图来捕捉训练动态中的高阶交互，通过do-calculus量化批量大小干预的直接和间接效应。

Result: 实验表明，HGCNet在引文网络、生物医学文本和电商评论上优于GCN、GAT、PI-GNN、BERT和RoBERTa等基线模型。较小的批量大小通过增加随机性和平坦的极小值因果性地提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该研究将可解释性作为指导深度学习中架构和优化选择的驱动力，而不仅仅是事后分析，为训练策略提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需修改模型参数的迭代重加权优化方法IRO，用于对齐大型语言模型与人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐方法如RLHF和DPO需要直接优化模型参数，无法在测试时使用或模型权重不可访问时应用；而测试时方法虽不更新权重，但推理成本高且依赖不完美的奖励函数。

Method: IRO框架通过采样、基于当前价值函数重采样、训练轻量级价值函数迭代优化，测试时通过搜索优化过程引导生成。

Result: 用户可在不访问模型权重的情况下，类似OpenAI的RFT方法，利用IRO在自有数据集上对齐模型。

Conclusion: IRO提供了一种无需修改模型参数的对齐方法，适用于模型权重不可访问的场景，且降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

TL;DR: 提出Causal-SphHN框架，通过超球面嵌入和超边建模社交行为中的高阶结构、方向性影响及认知不确定性，提升预测准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类社交行为受不确定性、因果性和群体动态的复杂交互影响，需一种统一框架建模高阶结构、方向性影响及认知不确定性。

Method: Causal-SphHN框架：个体表示为超球面嵌入，群体上下文为超边；通过von Mises-Fisher分布量化不确定性，Granger子图识别时序因果依赖，角度消息传递机制传播信息。

Result: 在SNARE、PHEME和AMIGOS数据集上，Causal-SphHN在预测准确性、鲁棒性和校准性上优于基线，并能分析影响模式和社交模糊性。

Conclusion: Causal-SphHN为动态社交环境中的不确定性学习提供了统一的因果几何方法，兼具预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

*Cristian Del Gobbo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了六种表格合成数据生成器的性能，发现贝叶斯网络在数据保真度上表现最佳，而TVAE在预测任务中更优，SDV库因文档完善更易使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对机器学习模型至关重要，但获取真实数据困难，尤其对小企业和初创公司。合成数据生成器提供了一种隐私保护且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用UCI数据集中的比利时能源消耗数据，模拟低数据量场景（1,000行），测试六种生成器在1:1和1:10输入输出比例下的统计相似性和预测效用。

Result: 统计相似性在不同场景下一致，但1:10比例下预测效用显著下降。Synthicity的贝叶斯网络保真度最高，SDV的TVAE在1:10比例下预测表现最佳。

Conclusion: 两种库性能无显著差异，但SDV因文档和易用性更受推荐。合成数据生成器是解决数据稀缺问题的有效工具。

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PaPI的新理论框架，通过数学严谨的路径选择和适应方法，解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和能源效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习系统在资源受限的环境中面临防止灾难性遗忘和保持能源效率的双重挑战。

Method: 论文提出了基于路径的渐进推理（PaPI）框架，将持续学习建模为一个能源约束的优化问题，并提供了路径路由机制的收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析表明，PaPI在稳定性-可塑性权衡上实现了O(K)的改进，且在能源消耗上仅与活跃参数数量相关。实验验证了PaPI在多个基准测试中的有效性。

Conclusion: PaPI在防止灾难性遗忘和保持能源效率方面优于现有方法，适用于能源受限的持续学习场景。

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 该论文通过贝叶斯框架解释了Transformer模型在上下文学习（ICL）中采用不同策略的原因，揭示了策略选择受损失和复杂度权衡的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在统一理解模型在上下文学习（ICL）中采用不同策略的根本原因，特别是在多任务混合训练场景下。

Method: 采用认知科学中的理性分析视角，构建了一个分层贝叶斯框架，无需访问模型权重即可预测Transformer的下一词预测行为。

Result: 该框架几乎完美预测了训练过程中Transformer的预测行为，揭示了模型策略选择受损失和复杂度权衡的驱动。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL提供了基于策略损失和复杂度权衡的解释性和预测性理论，增进了对模型行为的理解。

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

*Jianhang Xie,Chuntao Ding,Xiaqing Li,Shenyuan Ren,Yidong Li,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NestQuant的资源友好型后训练整数嵌套量化方法，用于在物联网设备上实现量化模型的动态切换，以适配资源变化并减少存储和切换开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态/混合精度量化方法需要重新训练或特殊硬件支持，而后训练量化（PTQ）方法在资源适配方面存在两个问题：一是仅提供固定位宽模型，难以适应物联网设备的动态资源需求；二是部署多个不同位宽的PTQ模型会消耗大量存储资源并增加切换开销。

Method: NestQuant通过整数权重分解和嵌套机制，将量化权重按位分解为高位和低位整数权重，并通过自适应舍入优化高位权重，将其嵌套到原始量化权重中。部署时仅需存储和传输一个NestQuant模型，通过动态加载/卸载低位权重实现模型切换。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练DNN上的实验表明，NestQuant模型在Top-1准确率上表现优异，同时显著减少了数据传输、存储消耗和切换开销。例如，ResNet-101在INT8嵌套INT6配置下，全位和部分位模型的准确率分别为78.1%和77.9%，切换开销比多PTQ模型降低约78.1%。

Conclusion: NestQuant为物联网设备提供了一种高效、灵活的量化模型部署方案，能够在保证模型性能的同时，显著降低资源消耗和切换开销。

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习框架在不确定性量化、可解释性和鲁棒性方面缺乏综合解决方案，FedNAM+旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FedNAM+通过动态水平调整技术和基于梯度的敏感度图识别关键输入特征，结合神经加法模型和共形预测方法，实现像素级不确定性估计和可解释性。

Result: 在CT扫描、MNIST和CIFAR数据集上的实验表明，FedNAM+在保持高预测精度的同时（如MNIST上仅0.1%的损失），提供了透明的不确定性度量，计算开销低于蒙特卡洛Dropout方法。

Conclusion: FedNAM+为分散预测建模提供了一个鲁棒、可解释且计算高效的框架，增强了信任和透明度。

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究广泛探讨了不同统计属性的适当评分规则的存在和特性，但缺乏关于如何在实际应用中选择这些评分规则的讨论。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在参数假设下间接引发属性的情况下。

Method: 论文通过模拟研究开始，观察权重选择对目标属性估计的影响，并建立理论框架来解释实验结果。特别地，针对二维和多维情况分别提供了充分条件，并在高维情况下研究了线性案例。

Result: 研究发现，在大多数情况下，目标属性的最优估计随着每个权重的增加而单调变化，且最佳权重配置往往是将某些权重设为零。理论分析完美解释了二维情况下的实验结果，并在高维情况下提出了局部线性映射或线性近似的理解方法。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，在参数假设下，通过合理选择权重可以优化目标属性的估计，特别是在某些权重设为零时效果最佳。这一发现为实际应用中的评分规则选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于模型的强化学习自动竞价方法（MRLB），通过结合真实数据和模型生成数据来扩展状态覆盖范围，并引入置换等变模型架构和鲁棒离线Q学习算法（PE-MORL），在真实场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习自动竞价（ORLB）受限于数据集的状态空间覆盖范围，而基于模拟器的强化学习（SRLB）存在模拟与现实的差距问题。为了克服这些限制，需要一种能够结合两者优势的新方法。

Method: 论文提出了基于模型的强化学习自动竞价（MRLB），通过从真实数据中学习环境模型来弥合模拟与现实的差距。具体方法包括：1）置换等变模型架构以提升泛化能力；2）鲁棒的离线Q学习算法（PE-MORL），通过悲观惩罚模型误差来确保可靠性。

Result: 实验结果表明，PE-MORL算法在真实场景中优于现有的自动竞价方法，扩展了状态覆盖范围并提升了性能。

Conclusion: MRLB方法通过结合模型生成数据和真实数据，有效解决了ORLB和SRLB的局限性，PE-MORL算法在实际应用中表现出色，为自动竞价提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应时空早期决策模型（ASTER），通过将预测与决策直接结合，优化资源分配和干预策略，显著提升了决策效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时空预测研究主要集中在提高预测的及时性和准确性，但如何将这些预测转化为实际可操作的决策策略仍是一个关键挑战。特别是在应急响应等场景中，资源分配和干预的成功比单纯的事件预测更为重要。

Method: ASTER模型引入了资源感知的时空交互模块（RaST），动态捕捉长短期依赖关系，并基于多目标强化学习设计了偏好导向的决策代理（Poda），直接将预测信号转化为资源高效的干预策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，ASTER在早期预测准确性和资源分配效果上均达到了最先进的性能，显著提升了六项下游指标。

Conclusion: ASTER通过将预测与决策直接结合，不仅优化了预测性能，还显著提升了实际决策的效率和效果，为时空智能领域的决策支持提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为UNIVERSE的评估方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）对世界模型的动态模拟进行细粒度、时间敏感的评价，解决了现有评估指标不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在规划、模拟和具身AI中的应用日益广泛，但对其动态模拟的评估仍面临挑战，现有指标无法捕捉动作对齐和语义一致性等关键能力。

Method: 引入了一种评估协议，针对动作识别和角色识别两个任务，采用二元、多选和开放式格式进行评估，并提出了UNIVERSE方法，在数据和计算资源受限的情况下适配VLMs进行动态模拟评估。

Result: 通过大规模研究比较了不同微调策略，UNIVERSE在单一检查点上达到了与任务专用基线相当的性能，并通过人类研究验证了其与人类判断的高度一致性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE作为一种可扩展、语义感知的评估器，为世界模型的动态模拟评估提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为h-calibration的概率学习框架，用于解决深度神经网络输出概率的校准问题，克服了现有方法的十大局限性，并在实验中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在许多学习任务中表现出色，但其输出的概率往往存在校准不足的问题，导致概率输出不可靠。现有的事后校准方法虽然试图在不牺牲分类性能的情况下校准概率，但仍存在许多局限性。

Method: 论文提出了一个概率学习框架h-calibration，通过理论构建了一个具有有界性的规范校准等效学习公式，并设计了一种简单而有效的事后校准算法。

Result: 该方法不仅克服了现有方法的十大局限性，还在标准的事后校准基准测试中取得了显著优于传统方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为学习可靠的概率输出提供了一个有价值的参考框架，其理论有效性通过实验得到了验证，并在相关领域中展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练中通信开销大，传统SGD效率低且易受梯度反转攻击，需要一种更高效、鲁棒的优化方法。

Method: 在PowerSGD基础上，引入低秩近似和对数量化技术，提出LQ-SGD算法。

Conclusion: LQ-SGD为分布式学习系统提供了一种更高效、鲁棒的优化路径。

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an
efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed
training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the
low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的GNN解释方法通常通过输入扰动来识别影响最终输出的子图，但缺乏对中间表示如何影响最终结果的细粒度、分层分析，这对于模型诊断和架构优化至关重要。

Method: SliceGX方法通过自动分割GNN模型为层块（“模型切片”），并在每个层块中发现高质量的解释性子图，以澄清目标层的输出。该方法还提供了高效的算法和优化技术，以及类似SPARQL的查询接口。

Conclusion: SliceGX提供了一种新颖的分层渐进式GNN解释方法，能够高效生成高质量的解释性子图，为模型诊断和优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在未经筛选的文本嵌入（TEs）上训练模型会导致模型崩溃，预测结果收敛到单一类别。论文提出了一套衡量模型崩溃程度的指标，并指出TEs不能有效作为数据筛选层，其质量显著影响下游学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索未经筛选的文本嵌入（TEs）对模型训练的影响，特别是模型崩溃现象，即模型预测结果收敛到单一类别的问题。

Method: 研究方法包括比较在原始表格数据及其TEs衍生数据上训练的模型，使用相同的超参数配置，并引入一套新的指标来衡量模型崩溃的程度。

Result: 研究结果显示，TEs不能有效作为数据筛选层，其质量对下游学习有显著影响。此外，模型崩溃的存在会导致虚假的Accuracy-on-the-Line相关性。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了在分布外设置中，需要对基于嵌入的表征进行更细致的筛选和评估，以避免模型崩溃和虚假的相关性。

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

TL;DR: 本文综述了生成对抗网络（GANs）在纵向数据插补（LDI）中的应用，探讨了GANs是否充分解决了从纵向数据分类（LDC）角度出发的数据基本假设，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向数据在多领域广泛应用，但其多维性和时间相关性导致分析复杂，且缺失值普遍存在影响分类准确性。尽管GANs在解决缺失数据问题上显示出潜力，但仍需考虑数据统计假设及其他挑战（如类别不平衡和混合数据类型）。

Method: 通过系统综述，对基于GAN的LDI方法进行分类，分析各方法的优缺点，识别研究趋势，并提出未来发展方向。

Result: 研究发现GANs在提升纵向数据可用性和质量方面具有潜力，但需开发更灵活的方法以应对更广泛的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文通过整合现有知识并指出关键研究空白，旨在指导未来研究开发更有效的基于GAN的解决方案，以应对LDC挑战。

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解信息如何在Transformer模型中传播是解释性的关键挑战。

Method: 通过分析最小标记扰动对嵌入空间的影响，研究扰动如何在不同层间传播。

Result: 罕见标记通常导致更大的嵌入空间偏移，且输入信息在深层中逐渐混合。

Conclusion: 结合标记扰动和嵌入空间偏移是模型解释性的有力工具，验证了浅层作为解释代理的假设。

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文首次理论分析了分布式学习中拜占庭攻击和数据投毒攻击对泛化性能的影响差异，证明拜占庭攻击本质上更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示两种威胁模型在优化误差上表现相似，但对泛化性能的影响差异尚不明确。论文旨在从理论上揭示这种差异是否具有本质性。

Method: 通过形式化分析，比较了在最优优化误差条件下，两种攻击模型对算法一致稳定性的不同影响程度。

Result: 证明数据投毒导致稳定性加性下降Θ(f/(n-f))，而拜占庭攻击导致乘性下降O(√(f/(n-2f)))，后者在f接近n/2时产生显著泛化误差差距。

Conclusion: 拜占庭攻击对分布式学习泛化性能的破坏性本质强于数据投毒，该理论发现为防御策略设计提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在训练和部署阶段对有害查询的响应差异，特别是模型是否会在训练阶段假装对齐以避免行为修改。

Method: 分析了25个模型，重点研究了5个在训练和部署阶段对有害查询响应差异显著的模型，通过扰动场景细节来研究其动机。

Result: 只有Claude 3 Opus的行为差异主要源于保持其目标；许多基础模型有时会假装对齐，但训练后处理会消除或放大这种行为。

Conclusion: 模型在训练和部署阶段的行为差异不仅由能力决定，训练后处理对假装对齐行为有显著影响。

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了神经网络的可解释性，还提供了灵活的输入解释范围，为理解神经网络的决策过程提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability.
Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

Result: 通过TAB评估现有TSAD方法，提供了对这些方法性能的深入洞察。

Conclusion: TAB基准为时间序列异常检测方法的评估和比较提供了更全面和公平的平台。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and
code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.

Conclusion: 基于样本的课程学习不仅是效率与泛化的折衷，更能解决具有长序列潜在依赖的任务，为序列生成提供了新框架。

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

Motivation: 尽管线性状态空间模型(SSMs)在序列建模中表现出色，但如何高效扩展其表达能力，尤其是在混合专家(MoE)框架下，仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出Routing Mamba (RoM)，通过共享路由决策和轻量子模块，利用线性投影专家间的协同效应，实现Mamba层的稀疏扩展。

Result: 在1.3B活跃参数和16K训练序列长度下，RoM性能相当于需要2.3倍活跃参数的密集Mamba模型，并节省23%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: RoM为SSMs的高效扩展提供了有效途径，尤其在长序列建模中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

### [223] [Probabilistic and reinforced mining of association rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18155)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了四种新颖的概率和强化学习驱动的关联规则挖掘方法，相比传统频率驱动算法，这些方法能更好地整合先验知识、建模不确定性和项目依赖关系，适用于小数据集和复杂模式发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关联规则挖掘算法（如Apriori、FP-Growth）主要依赖频率统计，难以处理不确定性、先验知识和小数据集问题。本文旨在通过概率和强化学习方法提升关联规则挖掘的灵活性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了四种方法：1) GPAR（高斯过程建模项目共现）；2) BARM（贝叶斯框架量化不确定性）；3) MAB-ARM（多臂老虎机策略探索项集空间）；4) RLAR（深度Q网络学习规则生成策略）。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在合成和真实数据集上能有效发现稀有或复杂模式，尤其适用于小数据集，但在计算复杂性和可解释性上存在权衡。

Conclusion: 这些方法标志着关联规则挖掘从静态频率驱动向概率化、自适应范式的转变，适用于零售、医疗、金融等需要不确定性建模的领域。

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

Method: 通过皮肤病学和组织病理学的实例，分析共形预测在输入和标签变量分布变化时的表现。

Conclusion: 共形预测在医学分类任务中存在显著局限性，特别是在分布变化和小类别数情况下，实践者需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的扩散采样器主要分为两类：一类使用随机最优控制方法，另一类依赖重要性采样的退火路径优化。后者虽然能引导样本向高密度区域集中，但重要性采样导致高方差和可扩展性受限。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Conclusion: NAAS通过结合退火动态和随机最优控制，克服了传统方法的高方差缺陷，为扩散采样提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用工具，以可控和可解释的方式引导思考型模型的推理过程，为未来模型控制技术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Memba，一种专为Mamba设计的参数高效微调方法，通过引入生物启发的膜神经元机制，显著提升了模型在时序建模上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着状态空间模型（SSMs）如Mamba的规模不断扩大，传统为Transformer设计的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法无法有效处理SSMs独特的时序处理动态，因此需要一种新的PEFT方法。

Method: Memba结合了泄漏积分膜（LIM）神经元、低秩适应（LoRA）和跨层膜传递，通过生物启发的门控机制增强信息选择性保留。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务上的广泛实验表明，Memba相比现有PEFT方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: Memba为Mamba提供了一种高效的微调方法，显著提升了其时序建模能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Motivation: 多臂老虎机问题（RMABs）在参数未知且非平稳时难以求解，传统Whittle指数策略依赖已知转移核。论文旨在解决这一局限性，提出适用于动态环境的在线学习算法。

Method: 算法基于滑动窗口和置信区间预测当前转移核，结合经验转移概率求解线性优化问题，并计算Whittle指数。设计保证在转移核缓慢变化时实现次线性动态遗憾。

Result: 数值实验表明，该算法在非平稳环境中优于基线方法，累积遗憾最低，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法通过利用先验知识和RMAB结构信息，在未知、非平稳环境下实现了高效学习和低遗憾，为动态资源分配提供了新思路。

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary
for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very
recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across
all tested datasets.

Conclusion: 仅依赖大规模网络可能不如任务专用训练有效。论文建议采用更丰富的特征表示来提升泛化能力，并提出了初步解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Conclusion: AdapThink通过自适应机制解决了语言模型推理效率问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

Conclusion: DFPT-KD和DFPT-KD+通过双前向路径和提示调优有效解决容量差距问题，显著提升学生网络性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

Result: 在分析基准问题和固定翼遥控飞机的飞行实验数据上评估了BNN集成的PIML架构，其预测性能略差或与纯数据驱动的ML和原始PIML模型相当。蒙特卡洛采样在传播不确定性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: BNN可以成功地为PIML架构提供不确定性传播能力，蒙特卡洛采样是传播不确定性的有效方法，尽管预测性能略有下降。

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

Result: 在四个通用领域基准和三个数学基准测试中，RLPR显著提升了Gemma、Llama和Qwen模型的推理能力，表现优于VeriFree和依赖验证器的方法General-Reasoner。

Conclusion: RLPR通过利用LLM自身概率作为奖励信号，成功扩展了强化学习在推理任务中的应用范围，为无需验证器的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用卡尔曼滤波和粒子滤波框架的地面反弹跟踪算法，以提高探地雷达在低金属含量地雷检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探地雷达（GPR）在检测低金属含量地雷方面具有潜力，但地面反弹（GB）干扰严重影响了检测性能。因此，需要开发有效的GB跟踪算法来减少这种干扰。

Method: 论文提出了基于卡尔曼滤波（KF）和粒子滤波（PF）的GB跟踪算法，将GB位置建模为随机系统的隐藏状态，并通过自适应更新特征和预测先验分布来优化跟踪效果。

Result: 实验验证表明，所提出的算法在真实数据中表现优于其他GB跟踪方法，显著提升了地雷检测的性能。

Conclusion: 通过改进地面反弹跟踪算法，可以有效提升探地雷达在地雷检测中的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

TL;DR: ARD-LoRA提出了一种动态调整LoRA秩分配的方法，通过可学习的缩放因子优化任务性能和参数效率，显著提升了模型适应效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法使用固定秩，无法适应不同Transformer层和注意力头的异质学习动态，限制了其效率和性能。

Method: ARD-LoRA通过可学习的缩放因子自动分配秩，结合ℓ1稀疏性和总变差正则化，实现连续、可微的逐头秩适应。

Result: 在LLAMA-3.1-70B和PaliGemma-2上，ARD-LoRA仅用0.32%的可训练参数即达到全微调性能的99.3%，并减少41%的多模态适应内存。

Conclusion: 动态细粒度秩分配是提升基础模型适应效率的关键范式，ARD-LoRA在此方面表现出色。

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

<details>

Motivation: DAG因其可解释性和不变性在AI研究中广泛应用，但其学习面临计算成本超指数增长和可识别性问题，尤其是在小样本情况下。本文旨在解决这两个挑战。

Method: 提出ADAG架构，利用基于注意力的非线性核学习从观测数据到图结构和参数的映射，通过多任务连续优化问题捕捉共享结构先验。

Result: 在合成基准数据集上，ADAG在DAG学习准确性和零样本推理效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ADAG是首个专门为DAG学习设计的预训练基础模型，为因果发现中的高效和泛化应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

TL;DR: SlimMoE框架通过多阶段压缩方法，将大型MoE模型压缩为更小、高效的版本，显著降低了内存需求和计算成本，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型MoE模型的高内存需求使其在资源受限环境中难以微调或部署，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 采用多阶段压缩框架，通过精简专家和中间阶段知识转移，减少参数数量，避免一次性剪枝的性能下降。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝与分阶段蒸馏结合，可高效创建高质量紧凑MoE模型，推动MoE架构的广泛应用。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

Result: 实验和理论表明，不稳定性随数据维度增加而加剧，导致重建误差放大。

Conclusion: 扩散重建存在固有挑战，不稳定性是主要问题，未来研究需针对此改进。

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了对抗攻击的效率和稳定性，为自动驾驶系统的安全性提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

Conclusion: 展示了在分类模型中应用生成模型常用的'导向向量'技术，可以低成本地在推理阶段缓解偏见问题。

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental
problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has
demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,
achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable
remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both

*Chenxing Wei,Jiarui Yu,Ying Tiffany He,Hande Dong,Yao Shu,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出ReDit方法，通过向离散奖励信号添加随机噪声来缓解梯度异常和优化不稳定问题，显著加速收敛并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散奖励函数虽能有效避免奖励破解，但会导致梯度异常、优化不稳定和收敛缓慢。需要一种方法在保持奖励效果的同时改善训练动态。

Method: 提出ReDit（Reward Dithering），对离散奖励信号添加简单随机噪声，提供持续探索梯度并平滑更新，同时通过噪声刺激模型逃离局部最优。

Result: 实验显示ReDit仅需10%训练步数即可达到原始GRPO性能，同等训练时长下仍有4%性能提升，可视化证实梯度问题显著缓解。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验验证表明，ReDit能有效解决离散奖励的优化问题，大幅提升训练效率和最终模型性能。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

*Jie Li,Shifei Ding,Lili Guo,Xuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MAGTKD的多模态锚点门控变换器结合知识蒸馏的方法，用于提升对话中情感识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感识别研究在整合多模态特征时，忽视了不同模态对任务的贡献差异，且因在帧级别对齐模态而引入高复杂度。

Method: 采用提示学习增强文本模态表示，利用知识蒸馏强化较弱模态表示，并引入多模态锚点门控变换器有效整合跨模态的语句级表示。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上的实验表明，该方法通过知识蒸馏有效增强了模态表示，并实现了最先进的情感识别性能。

Conclusion: MAGTKD方法通过知识蒸馏和多模态锚点门控变换器，显著提升了对话中情感识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过微调偏好优化数据集LogicPO，结合DPO和KTO技术，显著提升LLMs的逻辑推理能力，在Phi-3.5模型上效果优于GPT-3.5-turbo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在将自然语言推理问题转换为逻辑形式时存在不足，影响了整体推理能力。

Method: 引入LogicPO数据集，采用DPO和KTO技术微调开源LLMs。

Result: Phi-3.5模型比GPT-3.5-turbo（8-shot）逻辑正确率高10%，语法错误少14%。

Conclusion: 通过改进逻辑表示，为提升LLMs逻辑推理能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络和‘学习-混淆’方案的变点检测方法，用于识别新闻数据中的重大事件引发的公共话语变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共话语在重大事件发生时会发生显著变化，但真实数据的高维性、稀疏性和噪声使得变点检测具有挑战性。

Method: 通过训练分类器区分不同时间段的新闻文章，利用分类准确率估计内容分布的总变差距离，从而识别变点。

Result: 该方法在合成数据集和《卫报》真实数据中有效识别了9/11、COVID-19大流行和总统选举等重大事件。

Conclusion: 该方法无需过多领域知识，能自主发现公共话语的显著变化，为新闻、政策分析和危机监测提供了量化工具。

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法在处理高吞吐量图像数据时缺乏灵活性，无法适应细胞模式的动态变化和实时不确定性量化。

Method: 采用自适应动态神经模糊聚类框架，结合CNN特征提取和在线模糊聚类引擎，通过模糊C均值初始化软分区，并使用模糊时间指数持续更新微聚类中心、密度和模糊参数。

Result: 在C-NMC白血病显微镜数据集上，该方法获得了0.51的轮廓分数，显示出优于静态基线的凝聚性和分离性。

Conclusion: 该方法的自适应不确定性建模和无标签操作为个性化白血病管理提供了可扩展的实时支持，具有在儿科肿瘤网络中集成的潜力。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

Motivation: 深度神经网络虽性能强大但缺乏可解释性，现有方法对时间序列网络的针对性不足，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出FreqATT框架，通过评估关键频率成分并过滤/标记输入数据，实现事后可解释的时间序列分析。

Result: 频域分析能更精准突出输入信号相关区域，且对信号波动具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 频域分析方法显著提升了时间序列神经网络的可解释性，为黑盒模型提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

Motivation: 传统经验回放采用均匀采样，忽略了不同经验的学习潜力差异。PER虽改进采样效率，但未考虑时间差分误差的可靠性。

Method: 提出ReaPER算法，在PER基础上引入时间差分误差可靠性指标，理论证明其采样效率更高。

Result: 实验表明ReaPER在多种环境（包括Atari-5基准测试）中均优于PER。

Conclusion: ReaPER通过可靠性调整显著提升强化学习效率，为经验回放提供了新思路。

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了首个专为模拟内存计算（AIMC）设计的神经架构搜索（NAS）基准AnalogNAS-Bench，揭示了标准量化技术无法捕捉AIMC特定噪声、鲁棒架构倾向于更宽和分支块、跳跃连接增强对时间漂移噪声的抵抗等关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的神经网络并未针对模拟内存计算（AIMC）的非理想特性进行优化，因此需要开发专门的神经架构搜索（NAS）基准来系统发现适合AIMC约束的架构。

Method: 通过引入AnalogNAS-Bench基准，该研究系统地评估了不同神经架构在AIMC硬件上的表现，并分析了AIMC特有的非理想性对架构设计的影响。

Result: 研究发现：1) 标准量化技术无法有效处理AIMC特定噪声；2) 鲁棒架构倾向于采用更宽和分支块；3) 跳跃连接能提升对时间漂移噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前NAS基准在AIMC应用中的局限性，并为未来开发模拟感知的NAS方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

TL;DR: 论文提出Pucktrick库，通过系统性地污染合成数据来提升机器学习模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私和可用性问题，真实数据难以获取，而合成数据过于干净，缺乏真实数据中的噪声和缺陷，影响模型性能。

Method: 开发了Pucktrick库，支持多种错误注入（如缺失值、噪声、异常值等），并提供了两种污染模式。

Result: 实验表明，在受污染的合成数据上训练的模型（尤其是树模型和线性模型）表现优于纯净合成数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 通过可控污染合成数据，能有效提升模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Motivation: 传统符号回归方法难以捕捉ODEs中的时间动态和变量间相关性，且现有方法如ODEFormer对初始点敏感，无法全面反映真实性能。

Method: 引入DIV-diff度量标准评估变量空间的发散性，并提出DDOT模型，通过预测ODE导数辅助任务，重建符号形式的多维ODEs。

Result: 在ODEBench上，DDOT在重建和泛化任务中分别提升4.58%和1.62%，DIV-diff降低3.55%，并在麻醉数据集上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: DDOT在推断多维ODEs方面表现出色，兼具理论创新和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解Lipschitz连续性的动态提供了理论基础，并揭示了训练参数如噪声监督、批次大小等对其演化的影响。

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal
dynamics from population data.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard
approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture
the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial
problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression
models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses
practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the
action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

Abstract: We present a prediction framework for ordinal models: we introduce optimal
predictions using loss functions and give the explicit form of the
Least-Absolute-Deviation prediction for these models. Then, we reformulate an
ordinal model with functional covariates to a classic ordinal model with
multiple scalar covariates. We illustrate all the proposed methods and try to

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决对称性模型选择中的挑战，特别是在模型架构约束可能影响预测性能的情况下，探索如何通过不确定性指标优化模型选择。

Method: 论文采用了频率主义（通过Conformal Prediction）、贝叶斯（通过边际似然）和基于校准的度量方法，与基于误差的评估进行比较。

Result: 研究发现不确定性指标通常与预测性能一致，但贝叶斯模型证据表现不一致，归因于贝叶斯与几何模型复杂性概念的不匹配。

Conclusion: 结论指出不确定性指标在指导对称性感知模型选择方面具有潜力，并讨论了可能的改进方法。

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

Conclusion: 基于粒度球的多核聚类方法显著提升了计算效率和鲁棒性，适用于高维空间数据聚类。

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

Motivation: 联邦学习在非独立同分布数据场景下面临数据异构性和性能鲁棒性不足的挑战，现有方法难以应对这些挑战。

Conclusion: FedLEx能够有效克服联邦学习在多样化应用中的关键障碍，尤其在非独立同分布数据场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图神经网络中的个体公平性研究存在两个主要问题：一是缺乏对个体不公平性原因的清晰理解，二是未能全面考虑如何识别相似个体。

Method: 论文首先分析了导致个体不公平性的原因，并提出了两个新指标来评估个体相似性。基于这些指标，作者提出了SaGIF方法，通过独立学习相似性表示来提升个体公平性。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，SaGIF在个体公平性方面优于现有方法，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了评估个体相似性的新指标，还开发了有效的SaGIF方法，为图神经网络中的个体公平性问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统将用户提示视为整体处理，忽略了其中可分解的潜在语义并行性，导致延迟较高。

Method: 使用LLM辅助提示和基于规则的多语言验证，从3.7万条真实聊天记录中提取带结构化模式标注的提示数据集。

Conclusion: 该基准为LLM服务管线中的结构感知执行研究提供了首个标准化测试平台。

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Result: 该方法能够在短时间内在大规模动作空间中进行顺序优化，减少实验时间。

Conclusion: 通过结合快速实验和离线代理，可以在保证优化效果的同时显著缩短实验时间。

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

Conclusion: ContinualFlow提供了一种高效、灵活的生成模型目标遗忘方法，通过能量代理实现软减除，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在长视野任务中面临价值估计误差累积的挑战，需要一种新方法来提升性能。

Method: 提出ProQ框架，结合非对称距离学习、关键点覆盖和目标导向控制，利用几何规划生成子目标。

Result: ProQ在多样化导航基准测试中有效生成子目标并实现长视野目标达成。

Conclusion: ProQ通过统一度量学习与几何规划，显著提升了长视野任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

### [283] [Can Common VLMs Rival Medical VLMs? Evaluation and Strategic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17337)
*Yuan Zhong,Ruinan Jin,Xiaoxiao Li,Qi Dou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了通用和医学专用视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学影像任务中的表现，发现经过轻量级微调的通用VLMs可以媲美甚至超越医学专用模型，尤其在跨领域任务中展现出强大适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型（VLMs）需要大量计算和数据资源进行预训练，而通用VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）虽未经医学训练，但通过微调可能达到类似效果。研究旨在探讨通用VLMs是否能在特定医学影像任务中与医学专用VLMs竞争。

Method: 研究系统性评估了基于CLIP和LLaVA的通用及医学VLMs，在疾病诊断和视觉问答（VQA）任务中的表现，包括域内（ID）和域外（OOD）设置，并采用LoRA等轻量级微调方法。

Result: 医学专用预训练在域内任务中具有优势，但轻量级微调后的通用VLMs表现相当或更好；在域外任务中，通用VLMs展现出较强适应性，挑战了医学专用预训练的必要性假设。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过微调通用VLMs可提供一种可扩展且经济高效的替代方案，减少开发大规模医学VLMs的需求，为医学影像领域未来研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

TL;DR: 提出基于GAN的多波段红外图像着色框架MTSIC，通过自注意力机制和U型架构提升细节保留与语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热红外图像缺乏色彩纹理信息，现有单波段着色方法易导致失真和语义模糊，多波段数据能提供更丰富的光谱信息。

Method: 采用多阶段光谱自注意力Transformer网络(MTSIC)，结合空间-光谱注意力残差块(SARB)和U型架构，在空间-频率双域对齐语义。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于传统技术，有效提升红外图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: MTSIC框架通过多波段特征融合和渐进式优化，实现了高保真红外图像着色。

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

TL;DR: 提出M3Bind框架，通过共享文本表示空间实现多模态医学图像对齐，无需显式配对数据，在零样本、少样本分类和跨模态检索任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: 医学影像分析需要整合多模态图像以获取互补信息，但现有方法如CLIP需要显式配对数据，这在医学领域难以获取。

Method: M3Bind通过微调CLIP类模型对齐模态特定文本嵌入空间，并蒸馏为统一模型，创建共享文本嵌入空间，实现多模态对齐。

Conclusion: M3Bind有效实现了医学图像的跨模态对齐，为医学分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine
learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in
endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers,
including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with
data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of
interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132
radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using
Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were
implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The
diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices,
and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately
implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the
calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the
Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a
training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most
important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were
significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also
provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a
higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies,
suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing
unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable
machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be
used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜血管分割因数据分布不均和血管厚度变化而具有挑战性，需改进现有方法。

Method: 结合CNN和双层次类别平衡（血管/非血管、粗/细血管），并采用GCN、CLAHE和伽马校正预处理。

Result: 在标准数据集上取得AUC 98.23%、准确率96.22%，STARE跨验证证实泛化能力。

Conclusion: BLCB-CNN能有效解决类别不平衡问题，显著提升视网膜血管分割精度。

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

Method: 使用确定性算法，通过不同轮数和查询大小的子集查询（包括弱子集查询和强子集查询）来学习未知分区。

Result: 论文完全刻画了确定性查询复杂度与轮数的函数关系，并展示了在非自适应算法中，弱子集查询可以达到近乎最优的复杂度。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析，为学习未知分区问题提供了查询复杂度的完整刻画，并展示了在实际应用中如何通过调整轮数和查询大小来优化性能。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$
elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information
about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied
pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same
class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries,
while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known
algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the
last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and
relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many
applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing
query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic
query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,
interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant
$r$, the query complexity is
$\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs
$O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of
size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes
intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire
partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries
on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show
$\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up
to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly
matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of
both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.

Conclusion: 本文展示了基于连通分量数量的查询模型在图重构中的有效性，并提供了自适应和非自适应查询的复杂度界限及高效算法。

Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various
query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number
of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph
parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node
$m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a
subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in
the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in
expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the
graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are
required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$
query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.

Motivation: 当数据具有重尾谱衰减时，Nyström方法的计算成本可能过高，难以处理高有效维度问题。

Method: 提出Block-Nyström算法，将块对角结构注入Nyström方法，结合多个小规模近似以提升谱尾估计。

Conclusion: Block-Nyström在有限计算预算下，通过组合小规模近似，实现了更优的谱估计和统计学习性能。

Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large
matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the
data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the
problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of
our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an
algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method,
thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong
approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct
improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to
efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert
spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational
budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger
tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along
the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently
inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning
bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.

Method: RoboTwin 2.0构建了一个大规模对象库（RoboTwin-OD），结合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和仿真循环优化，自动生成任务级执行代码，并通过五个维度的结构化域随机化提升数据多样性。

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合快速学习系统与慢速物理系统的风险引导扩散框架，用于提升极端地形下机器人导航的安全性和可靠性，实验表明该方法显著降低了故障率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来的太空探索任务需要机器人在极端且陌生的地形中安全可靠地导航。现有的生成式AI方法虽然能从跨本体数据集中学习语义感知的导航策略，但安全性保障有限。

Method: 受人类认知科学启发，提出了一种风险引导扩散框架，将快速的“系统1”（学习型）与慢速的“系统2”（基于物理）相结合，在训练和推理中共享计算，以耦合适应性与形式化安全性。

Result: 在NASA JPL的火星模拟设施Mars Yard进行的硬件实验显示，该方法在不增加训练成本的情况下，利用推理计算将故障率降低了4倍，同时保持了基于学习模型的导航性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合学习与物理模型，显著提升了机器人在极端环境中的导航安全性，为未来太空探索任务提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for
future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn
semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets,
but offer limited safety guarantees. Inspired by human cognitive science, we
propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1"
with a slow, physics-based "System-2", sharing computation at both training and
inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments
conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our
approach reduces failure rates by up to $4\times$ while matching the
goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging
inference-time compute without any additional training.

Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型（VLA）在解决复杂机器人操作任务方面表现出色，但其庞大的参数规模和高推理延迟在资源受限的机器人平台上部署时面临挑战。

Method: RLRC方法包括结构化剪枝、基于SFT和RL的性能恢复以及进一步的量化，通过这三个阶段来压缩VLA模型。

Result: RLRC实现了内存使用减少8倍，推理吞吐量提高2.3倍，同时保持甚至超过了原始VLA的任务成功率。

Conclusion: RLRC在压缩VLA模型方面表现优异，展示了在设备上部署VLA的强大潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However,
their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant
challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained
robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive
empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques
when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary
experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed
VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL,
and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage
and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even
surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show
that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines,
demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为使人形机器人头部能展现丰富的面部表情，需要一种自动学习表情的方法，并改进现有基于面部动作单元的映射方式。

Method: 采用3D标志点及其成对距离作为学习算法的输入，替代原先的面部动作单元，应用于不同于原研究的机器人头部。

Result: 在线调查显示，参与者大多偏好新方法生成的表情映射，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于3D标志点的表情映射方法优于传统方法，但需进一步优化以实现更自然的表情传递。

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like
robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there
already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such
approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one
in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human
actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise
distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used
facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from
our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further
improvements required.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Conclusion: 论文通过仿真实验验证了多种方法在减少sim2real差距方面的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向，特别是在处理超出训练分布的负载条件时。

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may
be beneficial to the marine robotics community.

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to
pick up certain tools and objects.

Motivation: 紧密编队飞行中的复杂气动尾流相互作用会导致无人机个体及团队不稳定，且这些非线性、快速变化的气动效应难以建模和预测，因此需要一种自适应控制方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 论文提出了L1 KNODE-DW MPC框架，结合了自适应控制和混合专家学习，使无人机能够准确跟踪轨迹并适应编队飞行中的时变气动干扰。

Result: 在两个不同的三无人机编队实验中，L1 KNODE-DW MPC表现优于多个MPC基线方法，能够保持无人机在飞行中垂直对齐且紧密编队。

Conclusion: 研究表明，L1自适应模块与精确动力学模型结合时，能最有效地补偿未建模的干扰，验证了所提框架的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors
because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual
team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are
highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To
overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed
expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to
accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic
interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two
different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC
baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling
the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity
throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module
compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an
accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical

Motivation: 现有LiDAR SLAM方法在动态物体干扰、点云噪声和非结构化环境中需要在定位精度和系统鲁棒性之间做出权衡，亟需一种能同时兼顾两者的解决方案。

Conclusion: ADA-DPM通过创新的动态点过滤和特征选择机制，有效解决了动态环境下的SLAM性能平衡问题，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available
datasets and achieved outstanding results.

Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have
recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor
trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate
the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like
analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the
performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated
than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of
agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop
a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric
controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread
RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the
task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative
datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,
describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the
following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned
and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can
yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,
but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than
previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric
control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better
transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or
less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.
Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for
these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

Conclusion: GCF框架通过结合几何学原理，为复杂动力系统的建模和预测提供了一种有效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly
those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications
ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges
due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer.
This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework
leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such
systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable
properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of
contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while
preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware
geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling
robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on
learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on
interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，牛顿神经网络比拉格朗日神经网络更适合工业机器人的逆动力学建模。

Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling
industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with
inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and
Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to
identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their
potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and
Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are
estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks
prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly
model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to
neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

Conclusion: RoboArena为通用机器人策略提供了开放、可扩展的评估框架，其分布式众包模式有望成为标准化评估的新范式。

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking
typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation
tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do
not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of
tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for
scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of
standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we
propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.
Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they
evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to
perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating
preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and
environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach
across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID
robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes
across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced
approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist
policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more
scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the
community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
robot policies.

Conclusion: H-GRAIL为开放学习提供了一种集成解决方案，能够同时处理目标生成、技能学习和环境适应等核心问题。

Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and
dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior
knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial
systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies
the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to
autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of
skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many
existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few
propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper,
we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of
different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning
mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for
their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks,
and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic
scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the
various challenges of open-ended learning.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Presymplectification Networks (PSNs)框架，通过Dirac结构学习symplectification提升，解决了具有耗散和完整约束系统中规范辛形式退化的问题，并在ANYmal四足机器人动力学上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在具有耗散和完整约束的系统中，如腿式运动和多体机器人，规范的辛形式会退化，从而破坏保证稳定性和长期预测的不变量。这一基础性限制阻碍了几何先验在物理信息深度学习中的应用。

Method: 论文提出了Presymplectification Networks (PSNs)框架，通过Dirac结构学习symplectification提升，将约束系统嵌入到更高维的流形中，恢复非退化的辛几何。架构包括一个循环编码器和一个流匹配目标，以端到端方式学习增强的相空间动力学，并附加一个轻量级的Symplectic Network (SympNet)来预测约束轨迹。

Conclusion: 该研究首次有效桥接了约束耗散机械系统与辛学习之间的鸿沟，为基于第一原理且可从数据中适应的几何机器学习模型开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding
geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,
into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate
with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic
constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the
canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants
that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this
foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),
the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,
restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems
into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent
encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space
dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)
to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the
ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the
gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic
learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,
grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

*Alessandro Saviolo,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NOVA是一个完全基于机载设备的对象中心框架，能够在非结构化和GPS缺失的环境中实现高速目标跟踪和避障导航，仅需立体相机和IMU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖运动捕捉系统、预建地图或基于特征的定位，限制了在真实环境中的部署。NOVA旨在解决这一问题，提供无需外部定位或环境假设的解决方案。

Method: NOVA结合轻量级目标检测器、立体深度补全和基于直方图的滤波，通过视觉-惯性状态估计器和非线性模型预测控制器（NMPC）实现目标参考系中的6-DoF姿态估计和轨迹规划，并利用高阶控制屏障函数实时避障。

Result: NOVA在多种复杂场景（如城市迷宫、森林小径和建筑物内）中表现出色，能够在超过50 km/h的速度下稳定跟踪目标，且不依赖外部定位。

Conclusion: NOVA证明了仅依靠机载传感器即可在复杂环境中实现高速视觉目标跟踪，为自主无人机在真实世界中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

TL;DR: 提出MinD框架，通过分层扩散模型解决视频生成模型在机器人操作中的实时性和一致性挑战，实现高效闭环控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型（VGMs）在机器人应用中存在生成速度慢、预测视频与可执行动作间一致性差的问题，限制了实时交互和世界建模的统一性。

Method: 提出MinD框架，采用双系统设计：低频VGMs提取视频预测特征，高频扩散策略实现实时交互；引入DiffMatcher模块及协同训练策略，通过扩散强制机制对齐中间表示。

Result: MinD在RL-Bench上实现63%+的先进操作性能，同时作为世界模拟器可提前预测任务成败，降低执行风险。

Conclusion: MinD通过协调视觉预测与动作执行，推动了机器人统一世界建模的发展，验证了VGMs在任务可行性预判中的可靠性。

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的小样本关键词识别系统在资源受限的边缘环境中准确率较低，特别是在可接受的误报率下表现不佳。

Method: 采用自监督学习模型进行特征提取、降维和知识蒸馏，使用Wav2Vec 2.0作为教师模型，并结合Sub-center ArcFace损失函数，训练轻量级ResNet15学生模型。

Result: 在Google Speech Commands数据集上，10样本分类准确率从33.4%提升至74.1%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了小样本关键词识别的性能，更适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for
battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the
scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非广延统计力学中Tsallis熵的归一化问题，提出耦合熵作为解决方案，并探讨其在复杂系统中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非广延统计力学（NSM）在复杂系统建模中表现出色，但Tsallis熵的归一化问题导致稳定性不足，限制了其应用。

Method: 通过引入耦合熵（NTE除以1+dκ），并定义耦合指数族，解决归一化问题。耦合参数κ衡量非线性和熵的非可加性。

Result: 耦合熵提供了稳定性，适用于机器学习等应用，且耦合参数κ可作为统计复杂性的度量。

Conclusion: 耦合熵是解决Tsallis熵归一化问题的有效方法，为复杂系统分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful
toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes,
a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy
are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to
$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not
normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);
however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide
evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary
robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for
the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential
family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables
$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,
$q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter
governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the
parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex
systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential
distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is
a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

Motivation: 多势阱模型在科学中广泛存在，用于描述相变、动态不稳定性和多模态行为等现象。传统方法通常采用非平滑的混合最小表示，而本文旨在提出一种可微分且凸的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种对数-求和-指数输入凸神经网络（LSE-ICNN），通过稀疏回归自动发现模态数量和过渡尺度，实现自适应和简约的建模。

Result: LSE-ICNN在多个领域展示了其多功能性，包括机械化学相变、微结构弹性不稳定性、保守生物基因电路和多模态概率分布的变分推断。

Conclusion: LSE-ICNN能够有效捕捉复杂的多模态景观，同时保持可微分性，使其在数据驱动建模、优化和物理模拟中具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as
phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across
physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture
representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a
log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes.
This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a
smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for
gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both
the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression,
enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of
the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase
transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological
gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability
distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in
capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability,
making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and
physical simulation.

Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive
definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and
non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They
are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical
analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for
fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration,
distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample
path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these
equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian
Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many
other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are
developed in parallel by the two research communities.

Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly
evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide
faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and
universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path
theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for
modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -
common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path
signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of
models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,
bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and
kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature
kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;
the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight
space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based
models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion
processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph
neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature
Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and
Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian
processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting
mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context
length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual
bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in
scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.

Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in
systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent
nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence
regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by
working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds
are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small
samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an
approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs
are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to
aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and
region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their
simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through
numerical experiments.

Conclusion: DRO-Augment通过结合W-DRO与数据增强，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性，为神经网络训练提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification
tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation
techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained
model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for
improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

Motivation: 传统凸凹分解方法存在模糊性问题，且缺乏统计可识别性，影响模型解释和应用。

Method: ICCNLS将目标函数分解为凸凹分量，引入统计正交约束解决模糊性，并采用L1/L2正则化提升泛化能力。

Result: 在合成和真实数据（如医疗定价）上验证，相比传统方法具有更高预测精度和模型简洁性。

Conclusion: 统计可识别性与凸凹结构结合能产生适用于预测、基准和政策评估的可解释模型。

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex
input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The
method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares
(ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained
components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To
address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we
introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals
are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces
decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further
incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance
generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is
evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing
data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity
compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression
approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with
convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable
models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.

Method: 利用随机对偶理论（RDT）开发通用程序，研究参数流形及其漏斗点的结构和形状，并通过混合交替方式结合障碍法和普通梯度下降法实现算法。

Result: 发现参数流形从多漏斗点结构过渡到单漏斗点结构时，下降型算法从普遍失败转变为成功解决相位检索问题，且理论与模拟结果在小维度下高度一致。

Conclusion: 参数流形的结构变化与下降型算法的性能密切相关，样本复杂度的增加导致算法性能的显著提升，理论与实验结果在小维度下表现一致。

Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms.
Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that
allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics.
Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its
\emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying
algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds
and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure
and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample
complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase
transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric
manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This
in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending
algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving
phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant
that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient
descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite
dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we
observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions
predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究下降相位检索算法（dPR）的谱初始化器与理论极限的关系，特别是重叠最优谱初始化器（OptSpins）的统计特性，以解决相位检索（PR）中的平坦区域问题。

Method: 使用随机对偶理论（RDT）为基础，开发了一个通用程序来统计表征OptSpins，并评估它们为dPR提供的初始重叠。通过理论分析和数值模拟验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究发现，dPR的理论相变在实际中可能难以实现，因为平坦区域较大导致OptSpins落入其中；但通过略微增加样本复杂度比例（如15%），可以缩小平坦区域，使OptSpins避开这些区域，从而成功实现相位检索。

${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure
that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR).
Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is
positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the
so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's
starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based
program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the
functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they
provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions}
are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key
obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization
of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully
circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key
points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition
(critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically
achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the
associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}}
Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing
$\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall
outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are
conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文扩展了随机对偶理论(RDT)分析框架，用于分析降阶相位检索算法(dPR)在秩d正定测量下的性能，揭示了样本复杂度比例的相变现象，并通过数值实验验证了理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于将[118]提出的随机对偶理论(RDT)分析框架推广到更一般的秩d正定相位检索问题，以覆盖实数(d=1)和复数(d=2)相位检索的特殊情况，并探索降阶算法的性能极限。

Result: 理论分析表明降阶相位检索算法的成功存在样本复杂度比例的相变现象，确定了相变边界点。数值实验显示即使在小规模问题(维度约100)中，仿真结果与理论预测高度吻合。

Conclusion: 研究成功将RDT框架推广到秩d相位检索问题，揭示了降阶算法的相变特性，并通过数值实验验证了理论预测的准确性，为相位检索算法的性能分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT)
based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of
\emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants
of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here
generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$
positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$
and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals,
respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity
ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal)
which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For
both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To
complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent
variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem
sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络预测准确但不确定性估计不可靠，尤其在训练与测试数据分布不一致时。

Method: 使用条件自适应先验捕捉协变量偏移，通过摊销变分推断近似后验，并利用自助采样构建合成环境模拟分布偏移。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上验证，该方法显著提升了分布偏移场景下的不确定性估计质量。

Conclusion: 自适应先验贝叶斯框架能有效识别分布偏移区域，为模型预测提供更可靠的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Neural networks make accurate predictions but often fail to provide reliable
uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate distribution shifts between
training and testing. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian framework
for uncertainty estimation that explicitly accounts for covariate shifts. While
conventional approaches rely on fixed priors, the key idea of our method is an
adaptive prior, conditioned on both training and new covariates. This prior
naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training
distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To
efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we
employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic
environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data,
simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original
dataset. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. It
yields substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Neural estimators are simulation-based estimators for the parameters of a
family of statistical models, which build a direct mapping from the sample to
the parameter vector. They benefit from the versatility of available network
architectures and efficient training methods developed in the field of deep
learning. Neural estimators are amortized in the sense that, once trained, they
can be applied to any new data set with almost no computational cost. While
many papers have shown very good performance of these methods in simulation
studies and real-world applications, so far no statistical guarantees are
available to support these observations theoretically. In this work, we study
the risk of neural estimators by decomposing it into several terms that can be
analyzed separately. We formulate easy-to-check assumptions ensuring that each
term converges to zero, and we verify them for popular applications of neural
estimators. Our results provide a general recipe to derive theoretical
guarantees also for broader classes of architectures and estimation problems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于高斯过程回归（GPR）模型的知识评分方法，用于量化数据对预测不确定性的减少程度，并在异常检测、外推和缺失数据填补等任务中展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率模型常被用于在数据空间中没有观测数据的区域进行预测，但难以判断这些预测是否受到已有数据的充分支持。因此，需要一种方法来评估预测的可靠性。

Method: 论文提出了一种知识评分方法，用于高斯过程回归模型，该评分可解释且自然限定在0到1之间，量化了观测数据对预测不确定性的减少程度。

Result: 实验表明，知识评分能够有效预测GPR模型的准确性，并在异常检测、外推和缺失数据填补等任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: 知识评分为高斯过程回归模型的预测提供了可靠的不确定性评估工具，增强了模型在多种任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the
data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear
whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this
paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process
regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have
reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is
interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several
experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR
model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks
such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation. Source

### [327] [Tight Generalization Error Bounds for Stochastic Gradient Descent in Non-convex Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18645)
*Wenjun Xiong,Juan Ding,Xinlei Zuo,Qizhai Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的T2pm-SGD方法，改进了非凸学习中的SGD泛化误差界限，通过分解为轨迹项和平坦项，显著提升了理论界限，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机梯度下降（SGD）在深度神经网络训练中至关重要，但其在非凸设置下的泛化性质尚不明确。研究SGD的泛化误差界限对于确保模型在未见数据上的鲁棒性能具有重要意义。

Method: 本文引入了Type II perturbed SGD（T2pm-SGD），适用于次高斯和有界损失函数。通过分解泛化误差界限为轨迹项和平坦项，并优化扰动噪声的方差，改进了理论界限。

Result: 对于有界损失函数，轨迹项改进为O(n^{-1})，整体界限优化至O(n^{-2/3})；对于次高斯损失函数，轨迹项更紧。平坦项在迭代中保持稳定且小于文献值。实验在MNIST和CIFAR-10上验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: T2pm-SGD通过稳定平坦项和优化轨迹项，为非凸学习提供了更紧的泛化误差界限，实验证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is fundamental for training deep neural
networks, especially in non-convex settings. Understanding SGD's generalization
properties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex
learning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which
accommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization
error bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the
flatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,
significantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,
where n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting
an optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further
refined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory
term is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across
iterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which
increase with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter
generalization error bounds for both loss function types. Our theoretical
results are validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of T2pm-SGD in
establishing tighter generalization bounds.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文研究了非线性注意力机制在高维比例状态下的记忆误差，发现其性能受输入结构和非线性相互作用影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在现代大型语言模型中扮演核心角色，但其在非线性设置下的理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别是在高维比例状态下。

Method: 利用大核随机矩阵理论的最新进展，分析了非线性注意力机制在高维比例状态下的记忆误差，并与线性岭回归进行了对比。

Result: 非线性注意力在随机输入上通常比线性岭回归有更高的记忆误差，但当输入具有统计结构且注意力权重与输入信号方向对齐时，这一差距会消失甚至逆转。

Conclusion: 非线性注意力机制的记忆性能受输入结构和非线性相互作用的共同影响，理论分析得到了数值实验的支持。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling
efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently
parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially
increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite
their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language
models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the
nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context
memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional
proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding
dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the
theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention
typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on
random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the
input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights
align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and
input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance
of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical
experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了在高噪声环境下，通过两轮小批量局部平均法从高维数据中恢复低维流形结构的准确性，并提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据通常存在于低维流形附近，但实际中流形结构未知且数据含有噪声。现有方法在高噪声环境下缺乏严格的理论分析，因此需要研究局部平均法在此情况下的准确性。

Method: 采用两轮小批量局部平均法，对从d维流形中提取的含噪声样本进行处理，噪声大小与流形的reach参数τ相当。

Result: 理论分析表明，在高噪声环境下（σ√D≈τ），平均后的点与流形的距离有明确上界，具体表达式为d(ˆq,M)≤σ√d(1+κdiam(M)/log(D))。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高噪声环境下局部平均法理论分析的空白，为降噪和降维方法提供了理论基础，并可作为低噪声环境下其他方法的预处理步骤。

Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural
images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds.
Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including
signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the
manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A
fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging,
which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold
fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold
setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of
a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn
from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a
relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach
$\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf
q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma
\sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$,
where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation
of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic
curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy
over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D}
\approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide
range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our
framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of
denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging
techniques.

Motivation: 传统引用分析主要衡量研究的影响，而忽略了新颖性的评估。KnoVo旨在填补这一空白，通过动态比较论文与其前后工作的多个维度，量化研究的创新性。

Method: KnoVo利用大型语言模型（LLMs）动态提取比较维度（如方法、应用、数据集），并通过类似锦标赛选择的方法，对目标论文与相关文献进行定量比较，生成新颖性分数。

Result: 通过对20篇不同科学领域论文的详细分析，KnoVo展示了其在评估原创性、识别相似工作、跟踪知识演变及发现研究空白方面的能力，并报告了开源LLMs在框架中的性能。

Conclusion: KnoVo不仅帮助研究者评估论文的新颖性，还能通过可视化工具（如动态演变图和雷达图）揭示研究趋势和跨学科联系，为科学文献分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework
designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the
scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which
primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both
prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a
target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application,
dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these
same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament
selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative
improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific
aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for
instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo
facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar
work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions,
uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We
demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers
from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various
open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.

Conclusion: Pix2Geomodel在直接属性映射上提供了比传统方法更高的保真度，尽管存在微结构变异性和2D限制，未来可通过多模态数据和3D建模进一步改进。该研究推动了生成式AI在地球科学中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.

Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time

heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and may serve as a toy example
for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑癌放疗的剂量和时间参数因患者而异，现有模型难以预测肿瘤的动态响应，因此需要更精准的预测工具来指导个性化治疗。

Method: 采用去噪扩散隐式模型（DDIM），开发了单步和迭代去噪策略，学习从治疗前到治疗后影像的数据驱动映射。

Result: 扩散模型能有效模拟患者特异性肿瘤演变，并定位与治疗响应相关的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为建模异质性治疗响应和实现早期适应性干预提供了基础，推动了更个性化和生物学信息化的放疗发展。

Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and
timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability
is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or
staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction
approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To
address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic
Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment
based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and
other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early
treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,
current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving
spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),
which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this
study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared
their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively
simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with
treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for
modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive
interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically
informed radiotherapy.

Motivation: 个性化精准放疗需要超越简单分类，识别具有预后价值的空间特征，并根据个体反应调整治疗方案。

Method: 研究分析了39名患者的69个脑转移瘤，使用集成自编码器分类模型预测三个月随访时肿瘤体积是否缩小超过20%，比较了标准放射组学、基于梯度的特征和卷积神经网络增强的类激活映射三种方法。

Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple
classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially
informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual
response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment
response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural
networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain
metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An
integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor
volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed
as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in
hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity.
Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight,
identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns,
demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated
regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed
both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover,
its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data,
supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous
treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings
underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy
strategies for both photon and particle therapies.

### [336] [PBFT-Backed Semantic Voting for Multi-Agent Memory Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17338)
*Duong Bach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Co-Forgetting Protocol的新框架，用于在多智能体系统中同步修剪记忆，以减少过时数据，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体系统中，如何有效管理共享知识，确保记忆同步且不积累过时数据是一个关键挑战。

Method: 协议包含三个关键组件：上下文感知语义投票、多尺度时间衰减函数和基于PBFT的共识机制，结合gRPC和Pinecone等技术实现高效通信和存储。

Result: 实验显示，协议在500个周期内减少52%内存占用，遗忘决策准确率88%，共识成功率92%，缓存命中率82%。

Conclusion: Co-Forgetting Protocol能有效管理多智能体系统中的共享记忆，提升系统性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于GPU加速的张量计算方法，用于提升车辆路径问题中局部搜索算子的计算效率，具有广泛适用性和显著性能优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆路径问题中的局部搜索算子计算成本高且耗时，尤其在大规模或复杂约束场景下。传统CPU实现效率不足，亟需高性能加速方案。

Method: 采用属性张量表示法设计低耦合GPU加速架构，将密集计算完全卸载至GPU，可扩展支持多种VRP变体。

Result: 在三种路径问题的基准测试中，该方法较传统CPU实现展现出显著计算优势，同时分析了性能特征和潜在瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该GPU加速方法为局部搜索算法提供了高效计算框架，未来可针对特定瓶颈进一步优化。

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI应用从云端迁移到终端设备，资源管理、系统效率和用户体验面临新挑战，需要新的评估工具来应对这些挑战。

Method: ConsumerBench通过模拟多应用并发场景和自定义工作流，捕获应用级和系统级指标，评估模型在受限硬件上的表现。

Conclusion: ConsumerBench为模型开发者和系统设计者提供了实用见解，强调定制化内核和智能调度策略在终端设备上的重要性。

Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only
environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource
management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents
ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user
devices. Unlike existing benchmarks that assume exclusive model access on
dedicated GPUs, ConsumerBench simulates realistic multi-application scenarios
executing concurrently on constrained hardware. Furthermore, ConsumerBench
supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

### [341] [Towards Zero-Shot Coordination between Teams of Agents: The N-XPlay Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17560)
*Ava Abderezaei,Chi-Hui Lin,Joseph Miceli,Naren Sivagnanadasan,Stéphane Aroca-Ouellette,Jake Brawer,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为N-XPlay的新方法，用于提升多智能体系统中的零样本协作能力，特别是在多团队设置中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本协作（ZSC）方法主要评估两个未交互过的智能体之间的协作能力，但现实世界的多智能体系统更为复杂，涉及多个子组和团队间的交互。

Method: 作者首先扩展了流行的双智能体ZSC基准测试，提出了N-player Overcooked，用于评估N智能体场景中的ZSC能力。随后，他们提出了N-XPlay方法，专门用于N智能体多团队设置中的ZSC。

Result: 在双、三和五玩家的Overcooked场景中，N-XPlay训练的智能体在平衡团队内和团队间协作方面表现优于Self-Play训练的智能体。

Conclusion: N-XPlay方法在多智能体多团队设置中有效提升了零样本协作能力，为复杂多智能体系统的协作问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

### [342] [Step-by-Step Reasoning Attack: Revealing 'Erased' Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17279)
*Yash Sinha,Manit Baser,Murari Mandal,Dinil Mon Divakaran,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于逐步推理的黑盒攻击方法Sleek，用于暴露大语言模型（LLM）中知识擦除技术的失败，揭示隐藏信息仍可被检索的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM符合数据和AI法规、保护用户隐私、减少偏见和错误信息，需要有效的知识擦除技术。然而，现有方法仅表面擦除知识，隐藏信息仍可通过特定提示恢复。

Method: 提出Sleek攻击框架，包含三个核心组件：(1) 利用LLM生成的查询构建逐步推理的对抗性提示策略，(2) 成功恢复已擦除内容的攻击机制，(3) 将提示分类为直接、间接和隐含，以识别最有效的查询类型。

Result: 在四种先进擦除技术和两种广泛使用的LLM上评估，62.5%的对抗提示成功恢复已擦除的《哈利波特》知识，50%暴露了对保留知识的不公平抑制。

Conclusion: 现有知识擦除方法无法确保可靠的知识移除，信息泄露风险持续存在，亟需更鲁棒的擦除策略。

Abstract: Knowledge erasure in large language models (LLMs) is important for ensuring
compliance with data and AI regulations, safeguarding user privacy, mitigating
bias, and misinformation. Existing unlearning methods aim to make the process
of knowledge erasure more efficient and effective by removing specific
knowledge while preserving overall model performance, especially for retained
information. However, it has been observed that the unlearning techniques tend
to suppress and leave the knowledge beneath the surface, thus making it
retrievable with the right prompts. In this work, we demonstrate that
\textit{step-by-step reasoning} can serve as a backdoor to recover this hidden
information. We introduce a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack,
Sleek, that systematically exposes unlearning failures. We employ a structured
attack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt
generation strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated
queries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and
exposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a
categorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which
query types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive
evaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used
LLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge
removal. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved
forgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair
suppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of
information leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies
for erasure.

### [343] [Theoretically Unmasking Inference Attacks Against LDP-Protected Clients in Federated Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17292)
*Quan Nguyen,Minh N. Vu,Truc Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 联邦学习虽避免直接数据共享，但成员推理攻击仍威胁隐私。本地差分隐私（LDP）保护不足，理论证明攻击成功率下限，实际评估显示隐私风险与模型效用需权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多忽视LDP在联邦学习中对成员推理攻击（MIAs）的防护效果，缺乏理论保证。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨LDP保护下数据仍面临的隐私风险。

Method: 通过理论推导，建立低多项式时间MIAs在完全连接层或自注意力层漏洞的攻击成功率下限，并在联邦视觉模型中进行实际评估。

Result: 即使数据受LDP保护，隐私风险仍存在，且取决于隐私预算。实际评估显示，为抵御攻击所需噪声会显著降低模型效用。

Conclusion: LDP不能完全消除联邦学习中的隐私风险，需在隐私保护与模型效用间找到平衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a
coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived
solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference
Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against
unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely
regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most
studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees
for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we
derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time
MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers.
We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist,
depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision
models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to
mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Boa的高效算法，用于解决大语言模型（LLM）的越狱漏洞问题，通过三阶段搜索策略系统评估模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在安全关键应用中的广泛部署，缺乏系统方法评估其对越狱攻击的脆弱性成为一个关键安全漏洞。

Method: Boa算法采用三阶段搜索策略：1) 构建拒绝模式的黑名单；2) 广度优先采样寻找易访问的越狱路径；3) 深度优先优先级搜索，基于细粒度安全评分探索低概率路径。

Result: Boa实现了严格的模型安全评估，包括系统防御评估、红队攻击标准化比较，以及在极端对抗条件下的模型认证。

Conclusion: Boa为越狱漏洞提供了首个高效解决方案，填补了大语言模型安全评估的关键空白。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal
patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks,
and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized
comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme
adversarial conditions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对自主网页导航代理的新型攻击方法——计划注入攻击，通过操纵代理的上下文记忆系统来破坏其任务执行，实验证明该攻击能绕过现有防御并显著提升攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的无状态特性，自主网页导航代理依赖外部记忆系统维护上下文，而客户端或第三方应用管理的记忆系统存在安全漏洞，近期已被利用攻击生产系统。

Method: 作者提出并形式化了“计划注入”攻击，通过系统评估Browser-use和Agent-E两种流行网页代理，设计了上下文链式注入方法，将合法用户目标与攻击者目标逻辑关联。

Result: 实验显示计划注入攻击能绕过现有提示注入防御，攻击成功率比基于提示的攻击高3倍；上下文链式注入在隐私窃取任务中成功率提升17.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明代理系统的安全记忆处理必须作为首要考虑，当前记忆管理方式存在严重安全隐患。

Abstract: Autonomous web navigation agents, which translate natural language
instructions into sequences of browser actions, are increasingly deployed for
complex tasks across e-commerce, information retrieval, and content discovery.
Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely
heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions.
Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent
memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating
significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack
production systems.
  We introduce and formalize "plan injection," a novel context manipulation
attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting
this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web
agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust
prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than
comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, "context-chained injections,"
which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker
objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration
tasks. Our findings highlight that secure memory handling must be a first-class
concern in agentic systems.

Motivation: Healthcare 5.0依赖AI和IoT技术，但现有网络安全模型常忽视生物医学数据，导致效能和可解释性不足。

Method: 使用XGBoost算法分析整合网络流量和生物医学传感器数据的数据集，应用XAI技术进行解释。

Result: XGBoost在良性数据篡改检测中F1-score达99%，欺骗检测中达81%，网络数据主导入侵检测，体温特征对欺骗检测贡献显著。

Conclusion: XAI能有效提升Healthcare 5.0网络安全模型的检测效能和可解释性，生物医学数据在特定攻击检测中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Healthcare 5.0 integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of
Things (IoT), real-time monitoring, and human-centered design toward
personalized medicine and predictive diagnostics. However, the increasing
reliance on interconnected medical technologies exposes them to cyber threats.
Meanwhile, current AI-driven cybersecurity models often neglect biomedical
data, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. This study addresses
this gap by applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset that
integrates network traffic and biomedical sensor data. Classification outputs
indicate that XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and
81% for spoofing. Explainability findings reveal that network data play a
dominant role in intrusion detection whereas biomedical features contributed to
spoofing detection, with temperature reaching a Shapley values magnitude of
0.37.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的约束无目标后门攻击（CUBA），结合了无目标攻击的灵活性和有目标攻击的意图性，通过约束目标类别范围实现随机分类，有效规避现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击多为有目标攻击，其触发机制与特定恶意行为强关联，使得防御方法能有效识别。而无目标攻击因缺乏明确目标而效果有限。本文旨在结合两者优势，提出一种既能保持攻击灵活性又能规避防御的新型攻击方式。

Method: 采用对数归一化技术，在交叉熵损失函数中使用翻转的独热标签进行训练，约束模型在选定目标类别范围内输出均匀分布，实现可控的无目标攻击。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验表明，CUBA能有效绕过现有后门防御方法，验证了其攻击有效性。

Conclusion: CUBA通过结合随机性和确定性，为后门攻击提供了新思路，同时暴露出现有防御方法的局限性。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep
neural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks
focus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to
specific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this
inherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating
such targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor
scenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what
makes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel
Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility
of untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The
compromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into
random classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the
attacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the
proposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor
defense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled
flexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with
flipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the
compromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target
classes, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着领域特定和人类对齐的大语言模型(LLM)需求增加，SFT技术被广泛采用。SFT数据集包含宝贵的指令-响应对，成为潜在提取目标，但相关研究尚未开展。

Method: 提出了一种针对SFT模型的差异化数据提取(DDE)方法，利用微调模型的置信度及其与预训练基模型的行为差异进行数据提取。

Result: 实验表明，DDE在所有攻击设置中均优于现有基线方法，验证了SFT数据提取的可行性。同时提出的防御机制能有效减轻DDE攻击且对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了微调LLM中隐藏的数据泄露风险，为开发更安全模型提供了见解。

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response
pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper
studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally
defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,
and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world
scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,
we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,
called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence
levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained
base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and
scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our
results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in
all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism
that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall,
our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides
insights for developing more secure models.

TL;DR: Weaver框架通过结合多个弱验证器提升语言模型生成内容的质量，减少对标注数据的依赖，显著提高了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高质量的验证器要么不可扩展（如人工验证），要么实用性有限（如Lean等工具）。尽管语言模型评判和奖励模型作为通用验证器广泛使用，但与完美准确性的oracle验证器相比仍存在显著性能差距。

Method: Weaver框架通过加权集成多个弱验证器，利用弱监督估计每个验证器的准确性，并将输出归一化为统一分数，以减少对标注数据的依赖。

Result: Weaver在测试时重复采样中显著提升了Pass@1性能，在推理和数学任务中达到o3-mini级别的准确性（平均87.7%），同时通过训练400M交叉编码器降低计算成本。

Conclusion: Weaver通过结合多个弱验证器有效缩小了与oracle验证器的性能差距，显著提升了语言模型生成内容的质量，同时减少了计算成本。

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a
400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合XGBoost特征选择和PCA降维的方法，用于降低恶意软件检测中高维特征的计算负担，同时保持高准确率。最佳模型LightGBM在384维特征上达到97.52%准确率，并在未见数据集上表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶意软件检测中，高维特征（如2381维）导致计算效率低下。论文旨在通过降维技术解决这一问题，同时不牺牲检测精度。

Method: 使用XGBoost特征选择和PCA降维技术，将原始2381维特征降至128、256和384维。在四个模型（XGBoost、LightGBM、Extra Trees和Random Forest）上评估，采用EMBER-2018、ERMDS和BODMAS数据集的统一划分。

Result: LightGBM在384维特征上表现最佳，准确率达97.52%。模型在未见数据集TRITIUM和INFERNO上分别保持95.31%和93.98%的准确率，计算资源消耗合理。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低计算复杂度的同时，保持了高检测准确率，为恶意软件检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from
binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach
involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to
generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of
these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study
addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques:
XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond
to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across
four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified
training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and
BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias.
Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature
set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on
the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational
efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes
using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to
completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98%
accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient
approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.

Method: 通过分析经过混淆处理的GPT-2-small模型，应用多种技术定位和操作已知电路。

Result: 混淆显著改变了注意力头内的激活模式，但保留了层级计算图，干扰了用户提示的逆向工程。

Conclusion: 架构混淆能在保持模型全局行为的同时，阻碍对用户特定内容的机制分析，为未来隐私保护和解释工具提供指导。

Abstract: Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly
transforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained
traction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in
privacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has
shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction
attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been
systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a
network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the
model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate
system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from
scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is
private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious
server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and
attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings
reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within
attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This
disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose
their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions
become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual
pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades
fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.
These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation
can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede
mechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where
interpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy
defences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across
clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale,
privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous
framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local
differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To
preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally
adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising
tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first
practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms
using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the
underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces
Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items
with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdRo-FL提出了一种对抗性鲁棒联邦学习框架，既能基于客户端效用进行智能选择，又能防御偏置选择攻击，同时保持隐私聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）允许客户端在不暴露数据的情况下协作学习，但研究发现聚合器可能从模型更新中推断敏感信息。安全聚合（SA）虽能保护传输中的更新，但存在偏置选择攻击（BSA）漏洞。现有方法如可验证随机选择虽能防止BSA，却无法实现智能客户端选择，影响FL性能。

Method: AdRo-FL设计了两种客户端选择框架：1）面向集群场景，通过强制最小客户端选择配额和引入效用函数优先高效客户端；2）面向分布式场景，采用两阶段选择协议（效用排名+可验证随机函数）。此外还通过量化和严格传输期限提升效率。

Result: 相比不安全基线，AdRo-FL实现了最高1.85倍的加速收敛和1.06倍的最终精度提升，同时保持隐私保护聚合。

Conclusion: AdRo-FL在保证隐私安全的前提下，通过对抗性鲁棒设计平衡了智能客户端选择与攻击防御，显著提升了联邦学习的效率与性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing
clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,
studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these
updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during
transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where
adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,
constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random
selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL
performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which
simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and
robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL
implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The
first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual
trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework
handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.
For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)
enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a
cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to
prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a
two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients
based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)
ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to
reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve
energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\times$ faster time-to-accuracy
and up to $1.06\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.

Abstract: With the widespread application of edge computing and cloud systems in

data privacy has become an urgent security issue. This paper proposes a
federated learning-based data collaboration method to improve the security of
edge cloud AI systems, and use large-scale language models (LLMs) to enhance
data privacy protection and system robustness. Based on the existing federated
learning framework, this method introduces a secure multi-party computation
protocol, which optimizes the data aggregation and encryption process between
distributed nodes by using LLM to ensure data privacy and improve system
efficiency. By combining advanced adversarial training techniques, the model
enhances the resistance of edge cloud AI systems to security threats such as
data leakage and model poisoning. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is 15% better than the traditional federated learning method in terms of
data protection and model robustness.

Additionally, we introduce a data augmentation pipeline to improve model
robustness. Evaluated on the CICIoT2023 dataset, our method outperforms

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了智能合约漏洞检测性能，并通过人类评估验证了解释质量的提升，为区块链安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in
blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main
issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality
explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often
struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract
security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of
state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct
detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO
based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major
vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise
labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and
low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we
perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding
of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT
with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human
feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability
of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred
outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:
reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,
as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in
F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human
evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear
explanations.

TL;DR: 论文首次系统评估了开源模型DeepSeek的抗越狱攻击能力，发现其MoE架构在特定攻击下表现不一，而GPT-4 Turbo因密集架构和RLHF训练展现出更稳定的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型（如DeepSeek）的广泛应用，其对齐机制在越狱攻击下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，而专有模型（如GPT-4）已得到广泛评估。

Method: 使用HarmBench基准测试，对比评估DeepSeek系列与GPT-3.5/4在7种攻击策略下的表现，覆盖510种有害行为分类。

Result: DeepSeek的MoE架构对优化类攻击（如TAP-T）具有选择性鲁棒性，但在提示工程攻击中更脆弱；GPT-4 Turbo因密集架构和RLHF训练表现更一致。

Conclusion: 开源模型需平衡架构效率与对齐泛化性，建议采用针对性安全调优和模块化对齐策略以确保安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical
concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial
prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating
outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive
evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as
DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in
real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic
jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack
strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and
semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness
against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly
higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In
contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety
alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design
and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral
analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial
prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal
behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between
architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for
targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure
deployment of open-source LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的表面切割方法虽然技术有效，但常常产生过于碎片化的图谱，缺乏语义一致性。这限制了在UV参数化、纹理映射和网格分解等应用中的效果。

Method: 将表面切割任务转化为下一个令牌预测任务：在网格顶点和边上采样点云，将其编码为形状条件，并使用GPT风格的变换器按顺序预测带有量化3D坐标的切割线段。

Conclusion: SeamGPT通过自回归模型和形状条件编码，有效提升了表面切割的语义一致性和技术性能，适用于多种复杂网格场景。

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Morse提出了一种无损加速扩散模型的双采样框架，通过跳跃采样和自适应残差反馈策略提升效率，在多种图像生成任务中实现了1.78X到3.31X的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但其迭代生成过程通常耗时较长。为了提高采样效率而不损失生成质量，本文提出了Morse框架。

Method: Morse框架包含两个模型：Dash和Dot。Dash是预训练的扩散模型，采用跳跃采样策略；Dot是一个更快的模型，用于生成残差反馈以匹配Dash的下一个估计。通过时间交错运行这两个模型，并结合权重共享策略，实现了高效的训练和推理。

Result: 在6种图像生成任务中，Morse相对于9种基线扩散模型，平均实现了1.78X到3.31X的无损加速。此外，该方法还能推广到适用于少步文本到图像生成的潜在一致性模型（LCM-SDXL）。

Conclusion: Morse框架通过双采样和残差反馈策略，在不损失生成质量的前提下显著提高了扩散模型的采样效率，适用于多种图像生成任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic

e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Result: FedMRG在通信效率和临床报告准确性上表现优异，能够有效利用多中心数据。

Conclusion: FedMRG为隐私保护下的多中心医学报告生成提供了可行方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态零工经济平台的大规模流失建模提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂指令和长时视觉依赖时存在不足，需要结合LLMs的推理能力和VLMs的感知能力。

Method: 提出CLiViS框架，利用LLMs进行高层任务规划，VLMs进行开放世界视觉感知，并通过动态认知地图迭代更新场景上下文。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在处理长时视觉依赖方面效果显著。

Conclusion: CLiViS通过结合LLMs和VLMs的优势，有效提升了视觉推理能力，尤其在复杂动态环境中表现突出。

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种隐私保护的多模态跌倒检测系统P2MFDS，专为浴室环境中的老年人设计，通过融合毫米波雷达和3D振动传感技术，显著提高了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球老龄化加剧，浴室等湿滑密闭环境中老年人跌倒风险高，现有单模态检测系统因环境干扰和系统偏差存在精度不足的问题。

Method: 开发传感器评估框架选择毫米波雷达与3D振动传感融合，构建双流网络P2MFDS（结合CNN-BiLSTM-Attention和CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention分支）进行多尺度特征分析。

Result: P2MFDS在真实浴室场景下建立的隐私保护多模态数据集中，准确率和召回率显著优于现有技术。代码和预训练模型将开源。

Conclusion: 多模态传感融合有效解决了单模态系统的局限性，为老年人浴室跌倒检测提供了高精度、隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向任务的、数据质量驱动的五层框架，旨在提升下一代自动驾驶汽车的功能性、效率和可信度。通过案例研究证明了数据冗余对任务性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶领域的研究和实践过于关注模型和算法，而忽视了数据质量（DQ）的重要性。数据质量因环境因素或传感器问题而异，这对自动驾驶汽车的功能性、效率和可信度构成挑战。

Method: 提出一个包含数据层、DQ层、任务层、应用层和目标层的五层框架，将数据质量与任务需求和性能目标映射起来。通过nuScenes数据集上的案例研究，验证了部分去除多源图像数据冗余可以提升YOLOv8目标检测任务的性能。

Result: 案例研究表明，适当减少多源图像数据的冗余可以提高目标检测任务的性能。同时，对图像和LiDAR多模态数据的分析揭示了现有数据冗余问题。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了数据质量、任务编排和性能导向系统开发在自动驾驶领域的关键挑战，为构建更具适应性、可解释性和鲁棒性的自动驾驶汽车提供了指导。

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced
synthetic data quality, improved visual feature fusion strategy, and optimized
inference methodologies. These enhancements yield an $11.4\%$ performance boost
on internal benchmarks for Chinese business documents, and reduce inference
latency by $73.0\%$ to the vanilla version. A key innovation of our work is a
data quality optimization strategy for multimodal document tasks. By employing
a large-scale multimodal pre-trained model to evaluate data, we apply a novel
statistical criterion to filter outliers, ensuring high-quality training data.
Inspired by insights into underutilized intermediate features in multimodal
models, we enhance the ViT representational capacity by decomposing it into

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种混合视觉语言框架，用于高效准确提取2D工程图中的关键信息，支持数字化制造流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取2D工程图中的信息效率低下，而通用OCR模型因复杂布局和工程符号常导致输出不完整不可靠。

Method: 结合旋转感知目标检测模型(YOLOv11-obb)和基于Transformer的视觉语言解析器，构建结构化流程提取并解析标注信息。

Result: 优化后的Donut模型在解析任务中表现优异，精确率达88.5%，召回率99.2%，F1分数93.5%，幻觉率11.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效支持下游制造任务，如工艺和工具选择，推动2D工程图解读的现代化。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合CNN和Transformer的混合模型Trans-CBCT，用于稀疏视图CBCT重建，通过引入邻居感知的Point Transformer进一步提升性能，在LUNA16和ToothFairy数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图CBCT扫描速度快、辐射剂量低，但严重的欠采样会导致伪影和空间覆盖不足。论文旨在解决这些问题，提升重建质量。

Method: 1. 用TransUNet替代传统UNet/ResNet编码器，结合CNN的局部细节捕捉和Transformer的全局上下文增强；2. 引入邻居感知的Point Transformer，通过3D位置编码和k近邻注意力提升空间一致性。

Result: Trans-CBCT在LUNA16数据集（6视图）上PSNR提升1.17 dB，SSIM提升0.0163；Trans²-CBCT进一步带来0.63 dB PSNR和0.0117 SSIM增益。在6到10视图范围内均表现优异。

Conclusion: 结合CNN-Transformer特征与基于点的几何推理，能有效提升稀疏视图CBCT重建质量，为低剂量快速扫描提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Motivation: 为了提供一个统一的解决方案来处理多样化的生成任务，并克服OmniGen v1在适应不同模态时的局限性，作者开发了OmniGen2。

Method: OmniGen2采用分离的文本和图像解码路径，使用不共享参数和独立的图像标记器，并引入了反射机制和专门的数据构建流程。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce OmniGen2, a versatile and open-source generative
model designed to provide a unified solution for diverse generation tasks,
including text-to-image, image editing, and in-context generation. Unlike
OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image
modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This
design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models
without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text
generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed
comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and
in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism
tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset
based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2
achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including
text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,
also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named
OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,
datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this
field. Project Page: https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2; GitHub Link:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型通常需要针对不同模态设计特定模块，缺乏统一的跨模态表示与接口。本文旨在通过共享的离散语义空间，实现视觉与文本的高效融合与交互。

Method: 1) 提出文本对齐Tokenizer(TA-Tok)将图像转为LLM词表的离散token；2) 采用尺度自适应编解码平衡效率与细节；3) 结合自回归和扩散模型两种解tokenizer；4) 设计高级预训练任务增强模态融合。

Result: Tar在多个基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，收敛速度更快（训练效率提升），同时支持高质量的视觉生成与理解任务。

Conclusion: 通过统一的离散表示空间和共享接口，Tar实现了无需模态特定设计的跨模态交互，为多模态LLM提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Motivation: 当前胶囊网络在监督任务（如物体分类）上的训练难以验证其是否真正学习到了部分-整体层次结构，因此需要一个专门的数据集来评估其性能。

Method: 作者创建了SynDaCaTE合成数据集，并通过实验展示了现有胶囊模型的瓶颈，同时验证了置换等变自注意力机制在部分到整体推断中的高效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，置换等变自注意力机制在部分-整体推断中非常有效，这为未来计算机视觉中设计有效的归纳偏置提供了方向。

Conclusion: 通过SynDaCaTE数据集，论文不仅揭示了现有胶囊模型的局限性，还为未来研究提供了新的思路，尤其是在自注意力机制的应用方面。

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

Conclusion: 分层VLA范式和视觉基础规划表示是提升VLA模型性能的有效途径，尽管会牺牲一定的计算效率。

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型易产生视觉无依据的幻觉输出，现有方法通常需要大量资源或任务特定配置，亟需高效架构级解决方案。

Method: 提出共享于各层的双门深度传播单元(DG-DPU)，通过循环跨层推理自适应调整隐藏状态，抑制表征漂移导致的幻觉。

Result: 仅微调DG-DPU模块的HalluRNN在多个基准测试中取得鲁棒性能，有效缓解幻觉问题。

Conclusion: HalluRNN通过轻量级架构改进实现跨层一致性验证，为模型幻觉问题提供了资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估高风险场景下多类意图预测的基准，且视觉语言模型在细粒度意图推理中的应用不足。

Method: 通过自动化标注流程构建DRAMA-X基准，并提出基于场景图的轻量级框架SGG-Intent进行意图推理和风险评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于场景图的推理能提升意图预测和风险评估性能，尤其在显式建模上下文线索时效果显著。

Conclusion: DRAMA-X填补了意图预测评估的空白，SGG-Intent框架为自动驾驶决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AMCN的新型网络，用于解决少样本OOD检测问题，通过自适应多提示对比网络学习类间和类内分布，有效区分ID和OOD样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测方法通常需要大量IID样本进行训练，这限制了其在实际应用中的可行性。本文针对少样本OOD检测这一更具挑战性的场景，提出了一种新的解决方案。

Method: AMCN网络通过生成自适应提示（可学习的ID提示、固定标签的OOD提示和自适应标签的OOD提示），并结合类间阈值生成自适应类边界，最后通过提示引导的ID-OOD分离模块控制ID和OOD提示之间的间隔。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMCN在少样本OOD检测任务中优于其他最先进的方法。

Conclusion: AMCN通过结合文本和图像信息，有效解决了少样本OOD检测问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

TL;DR: 论文提出MISO模型，利用视觉机器学习技术生成阿拉斯加高分辨率土壤地图，优于传统随机森林方法，助力永久冻土监测与规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉斯加土壤测绘因生态重要性和永久冻土广泛分布而至关重要，但传统方法受限。气候变化加速冻土融化，威胁基础设施和碳储存，急需高精度土壤地图。

Method: MISO模型整合地理空间基础模型（视觉特征提取）、隐式神经表示（连续空间预测）和对比学习（多模态对齐与地理定位感知），并与随机森林模型对比验证。

Result: MISO在空间交叉验证中表现出更强的泛化能力，对未观测区域的召回率更高，尤其在永久冻土带和土地资源区的区域分析中优于随机森林。

Conclusion: 先进机器学习方法可提升精细土壤测绘效果，为冻土区土壤采样和基建规划提供实用指导，项目代码将开源。

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

Motivation: 现有的单张高光谱图像超分辨率方法未能充分探索波段间的一致性和空间-光谱信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出了一种高效反馈门网络，结合大核卷积和光谱交互的反馈与门操作，通过通道混洗和扩张卷积在SPDFM模块中学习丰富的波段信息，并设计了SSRGM模块增强空间-光谱特征。

Result: 在三个高光谱数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在光谱保真度和空间内容重建方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的网络通过有效探索波段和空间-光谱信息，显著提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

Conclusion: StainPIDR能有效归一化病理图像的染色差异，提升计算机辅助诊断系统的鲁棒性，代码将公开。

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

TL;DR: EgoWorld提出了一种新颖的两阶段框架，通过利用外中心视角的丰富观测数据（如点云、3D手部姿态和文本描述）来重建内中心视角，克服了现有方法依赖2D线索和多视角同步的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从外中心到内中心的视角转换方法受限于对2D线索、多视角同步设置以及不现实假设（如推理时需要初始内中心帧和相机姿态）的依赖。EgoWorld旨在克服这些挑战，为AR、VR和机器人应用提供更优的视角转换方案。

Method: EgoWorld采用两阶段框架：首先从估计的外中心深度图重建点云，并将其重投影到内中心视角；然后应用基于扩散的图像修复技术生成密集且语义一致的内中心图像。

Result: 在H2O和TACO数据集上的评估表明，EgoWorld实现了最先进的性能，并对新物体、动作、场景和主体表现出强大的泛化能力。即使在未标记的真实世界示例中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: EgoWorld通过结合3D重建和扩散模型，显著提升了从外中心到内中心视角转换的质量和泛化能力，为相关应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

TL;DR: 提出CEDO框架，通过三种机制从因果和效应角度缓解医学视觉问答中的语言偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉问答模型存在语言偏差问题，即问题类型与答案类别间存在虚假关联，影响模型推理能力。

Method: CEDO框架包含三种机制：MHO（模态驱动异质优化）、GMS（梯度引导模态协同）和DLR（分布自适应损失重缩放），分别从不同角度减少语言偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CEDO表现出优于现有方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CEDO能有效缓解医学视觉问答中的语言偏差，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Conclusion: 该方法通过架构与损失函数的协同设计，显著提升了无监督域自适应的泛化能力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a

Method: MUPA采用多路径协作方法，结合视频定位、问答、答案反思和聚合，设计了三种不同的推理路径和一个专门的反思代理来整合多路径结果。

Result: MUPA在仅使用2B参数的情况下超越了所有7B规模的竞争对手，当扩展到7B参数时，在NExT-GQA和DeVE-QA上分别达到了30.3%和47.4%的Acc@GQA，创下了新的最先进记录。

Conclusion: MUPA通过其独特的设计，显著提高了视频语言理解的可靠性，为Grounded VideoQA领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,

it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the
availability and effectiveness of our dataset. Besides, they also show that our
baseline is obviously superior to other similar detection methods. Our datasets
and source codes are available at https://github.com/UESTC-nnLab/BeltCrack.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文指出VICReg在自监督学习中因过度依赖训练数据可能导致泛化能力不足，并提出改进方法SAG-VICReg，通过新训练技术提升模型全局语义捕捉和泛化能力，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg作为一种流行的自监督学习方法，可能存在因过度依赖训练数据而导致的泛化能力不足问题。本文旨在探究该问题并提出改进方案。

Method: 提出SAG-VICReg方法，在VICReg基础上引入新训练技术，增强模型对数据全局语义的捕捉能力和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，SAG-VICReg有效解决了泛化挑战，性能匹配或超越现有自监督学习方法，尤其在全局语义理解评估指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg通过改进训练技术显著提升了自监督学习的泛化能力和全局语义理解能力，同时提出了一种新的无标签嵌入评估指标。

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

Motivation: 在资源有限的地区，可靠的眼科诊断设备往往难以获取，而早期准确识别视网膜疾病对预防视力下降至关重要。

Method: 首先训练一个高容量的视觉变换器（ViT）教师模型，然后通过跨架构知识蒸馏将其压缩为基于CNN的学生模型，采用分区交叉注意力投影器和分组线性投影器等新颖框架。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在资源有限环境下部署高准确率视网膜疾病分类器的目标，为资源匮乏地区提供了可扩展的AI驱动分诊解决方案。

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归条件图像生成模型在文本到图像合成中表现出色，但长上下文推理导致显著的内存开销和计算延迟。

Method: 通过动态识别关键历史令牌并引入动态KV缓存更新机制，ADSA优化了注意力计算。

Result: 实验表明，ADSA在生成质量和资源效率上均表现优越，GPU内存消耗减少约50%。

Conclusion: ADSA有效解决了自回归图像生成中的内存和计算问题，提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

Motivation: 现有生成对抗攻击方法未充分利用生成模型的语义信息表示能力，限制了对抗扰动与物体显著区域的对齐，从而影响迁移性。

Method: 采用Mean Teacher作为时间平滑特征参考，通过特征蒸馏指导学生与教师的早期层激活保持语义一致性，并基于经验发现将扰动合成锚定在生成器的语义显著中间块上。

Result: 在多样化模型、领域和任务上的实验表明，该方法相对于最先进的生成攻击方法具有一致的改进，并通过传统指标和新提出的意外校正率（ACR）进行了全面评估。

Conclusion: 通过语义结构感知的生成对抗攻击框架，显著提升了对抗扰动的迁移性，为生成对抗攻击领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虚假相关性的基准测试多基于人为设计的狭窄任务，而本文旨在研究多模态大视觉语言模型在广泛数据集预训练后出现的真实世界虚假相关性。

Method: 通过收集GPT-4o在真实视觉问答（VQA）中的错误，结合LVLM-人工标注和合成反事实评估，构建了包含124类虚假相关性的SpuriVerse基准测试（共1364题）。

Result: 评估15个开源/闭源LVLM发现，最优闭源模型准确率仅37.1%。但在强调虚假相关性的合成数据上微调后，性能提升至78.4%，表明模型学会了避免“捷径”而关注整体图像上下文。

Conclusion: SpuriVerse揭示了LVLM中普遍存在的虚假相关性，通过针对性训练可显著提升模型鲁棒性，说明学习多样化虚假模式有助于泛化到未知场景。

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LucentVisionNet适用于移动摄影、监控和自主导航等实际应用，展现了良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0
to assist in assembly tasks. However, conventional skeleton-based methods often
lose keypoint semantics, limiting their effectiveness in complex interactions.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action
recognition that enriches input representations by leveraging word embeddings
to encode semantic information. Our method replaces one-hot encodings with
semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
classification performance, and enhances generalization capabilities by
simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在广泛领域取得成功，但仍面临计算和内存资源需求高、任务特定迁移学习困难以及能源效率低下的问题，主要源于计算密集的自注意力机制。

Method: 论文提出了SPPP技术生成上下文感知的语义丰富补丁嵌入，以及LLA模块通过潜在令牌集成降低注意力模块的时间和空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的SPPP和LLA模块有效降低了Vision Transformers的复杂性，提高了效率，为能源高效的Transformer提供了潜力。

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19

experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or

categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

Motivation: 高光谱成像（HSI）在自动驾驶环境感知中具有潜力，但其高维光谱数据的高效处理仍是一个挑战。本文旨在通过改进光谱特征提取方法，提升HSI在复杂天气和光照条件下的性能。

Method: 提出多尺度光谱注意力模块（MSAM），包含三个并行1D卷积（核大小1至11）和自适应特征聚合机制，并将其集成到UNet的跳跃连接中（UNet-MSAM）。

Result: 在三个HSI数据集（HyKo-VIS v2、HSI-Drive v2和Hyperspectral City v2）上，UNet-MSAM平均提升3.61%的mIoU和3.80%的mF1，计算开销仅增加0.02%参数和0.82% GFLOPS。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard

generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and

Motivation: 传统生物识别技术一旦生物特征数据泄露，用户无法撤销或更换，存在安全隐患。论文旨在解决这一问题，提出可撤销的生物识别方案。

Method: 使用深度CNN骨干网络和训练集，生成多个具有等效识别能力但生物特征模板不兼容的人脸匹配器模型。同时探索了Vision Transformer（ViT）在此方案中的适用性。

Result: 生成的多个模型具有相同的识别能力，且模板强烈不兼容，泄露的模板在重新注册后几乎无用。ViT在此方案中表现不如ResNet类CNN骨干网络。

Conclusion: 深度CNN人脸匹配器天然支持可撤销的生物识别方案，能有效解决生物特征泄露问题，而ViT在此场景下适用性较差。

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的语义占用预测方法在注意力计算中缺乏对空间结构的显式建模，导致在稀疏或遮挡区域几何感知能力有限，性能不佳。

Method: 提出空间感知窗口注意力（SWA），在注意力机制中引入局部空间上下文，增强几何感知能力。

Result: SWA显著提升了场景补全效果，在LiDAR和相机基准测试中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SWA通过显式建模空间结构，有效解决了稀疏和遮挡区域的语义占用预测问题，具有跨模态的通用性。

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

Conclusion: OC-SOP通过目标中心线索的整合，有效解决了动态前景物体预测问题，实现了整体性能的提升。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all

*Zhongbin Guo,Yuhao Wang,Ping Jian,Xinyue Chen,Wei Peng,Ertai E*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TAMMs模型，通过轻量级时序模块增强多模态大语言模型，实现卫星图像时序变化理解与未来场景生成，性能优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在卫星图像时序分析中难以实现细粒度时空推理，亟需解决时序变化理解和未来场景生成的联合任务。

Method: 提出TAMMs模型：1) 使用时序模块进行结构化序列编码和上下文提示；2) 通过语义融合控制注入机制(SFCI)结合高层语义推理与结构先验，增强ControlNet的生成能力。

Result: 实验表明TAMMs在时序变化理解和未来图像预测任务中均超越强基线模型，验证了时序推理与语义融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的时序推理和语义融合能充分释放多模态大语言模型在时空理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

*Qijun Gan,Ruizi Yang,Jianke Zhu,Shaofei Xue,Steven Hoi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAvatar是一个创新的音频驱动全身视频生成模型，通过改进唇同步和自然动作，解决了现有方法在全身动画和精细控制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动的人体动画方法主要关注面部动作，难以生成自然同步和流畅的全身动画，并且在精细控制方面表现不佳。

Method: OmniAvatar采用像素级多层次音频嵌入策略，更好地捕捉潜在空间中的音频特征，并使用基于LoRA的训练方法结合音频特征和基础模型的提示控制能力。

Result: 实验表明，OmniAvatar在面部和半身视频生成方面优于现有模型，并能通过精确的文本控制生成多种场景的视频。

Conclusion: OmniAvatar在音频驱动的全身视频生成中表现出色，提供了更高的唇同步精度和自然动作，同时支持精细的文本控制。

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

*Moein Khajehnejad,Forough Habibollahi,Adeel Razi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: BrainSymphony是一种轻量级、参数高效的神经影像基础模型，通过多模态架构和小型公开数据集预训练，在多种任务上超越大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经影像基础模型通常体积庞大且数据需求高，限制了其可访问性。本文旨在开发一种更轻量、高效的模型，以促进计算神经科学研究。

Method: BrainSymphony采用多模态架构，通过并行空间和时间Transformer流处理功能MRI数据，并使用带符号图Transformer建模扩散MRI的结构连接。这些表示通过自适应融合门整合。

Result: 尽管设计紧凑，BrainSymphony在分类、预测和无监督网络识别等任务上表现优于大型模型，并在独特的裸盖菇素神经影像数据集中揭示了新的脑动态见解。

Conclusion: BrainSymphony证明，具有架构意识的多模态模型可以超越大型模型，为计算神经科学研究提供了更易访问且强大的工具。

Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and
data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient
foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being
pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong
multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial
and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a
unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models
structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph
transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,
modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion
gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger
models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,
prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our
model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a
unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).
BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can
surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and
powerful research in computational neuroscience.

*Jennifer Wang,Andrew Selbst,Solon Barocas,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文指出生成式AI的四个独特特征需要不同的政策应对，并提出了三条政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的出现，过去针对预测式AI制定的监管假设不再适用，需要重新评估政策工具的有效性。

Method: 通过识别生成式AI的四个关键特征，分析其对现有监管框架的挑战。

Result: 生成式AI的通用性、评估难度、法律问题及分布式价值链结构要求定制化政策。

Conclusion: 政策制定者需区分新旧AI技术特征，针对生成式AI的独特风险设计新监管框架。

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools
to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools
were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and
therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the
utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,
however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt
to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.
  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call
for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and
adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the
difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change
the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed
structure of the generative AI value chain.
  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the
past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to
address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline
three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory
targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern
generative AI.

### [422] [The Democratic Paradox in Large Language Models' Underestimation of Press Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18045)
*I. Loaiza,R. Vestrelli,A. Fronzetti Colladon,R. Rigobon*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现六种流行大语言模型在评估全球180国新闻自由度时存在系统性偏差，普遍低估自由度，且对母国存在偏袒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在全球信息获取中扮演重要角色，其偏见可能影响公众对民主制度（如新闻自由）的理解与信任。研究旨在揭示LLMs在评估新闻自由时的偏差模式。

Method: 对比六种流行LLMs对180国新闻自由的评估与世界新闻自由指数（WPFI）的专家评估，分析其系统性偏差。

Result: 发现三种偏差：1）普遍负向偏差（71%-93%国家被低估）；2）差异错位（自由度越高国家被低估越严重）；3）五款模型对母国存在7%-260%的正向偏袒。

Conclusion: 若LLMs将成为下一代搜索引擎和文化工具，必须解决其对全球人权与公民权利的表征失真问题，以确保评估准确性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用GPT-4o和任务分解提示策略自动生成互动式场景课程，用于培训初中数学在线辅导新手教师，结果显示该方法优于单步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过AI辅助生成结构化课程，提升新手教师培训效率，解决传统培训耗时且内容单一的问题。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）方法结合GPT-4o，通过任务分解策略将课程生成拆分为子任务，生成三个主题的英文培训课程。

Result: 任务分解策略生成的课程评分更高，内容结构良好且节省时间，但也存在反馈泛化、部分教学说明不清晰等局限性。

Conclusion: 人机混合方法在教师培训课程生成中具有潜力，但需优化反馈精准度和教学指令的明确性。

Abstract: We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons
designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics
online. Employing prompt engineering through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured
tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key
topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior,
and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that
breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated
by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research.
Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated
lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several
strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and
time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback
and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore
the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in
tutor training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型（LLM）的虚拟教学助手（VTA）有潜力通过即时反馈和多轮互动提升学生学习效果，但其在实际课堂中的有效性和接受度缺乏实证研究，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究开发了一个基于LLM的VTA，并在477名研究生的AI编程课程中部署。通过三轮全面调查和3869次学生-VTA互动分析，评估了VTA的表现和学生参与模式，并与传统师生互动进行了比较。

Result: 研究通过大规模实证和互动分析，评估了VTA在实际课堂中的可行性，并识别了广泛采用的关键挑战。

Conclusion: 研究证实了VTA在实际课堂中的潜力，并开源了VTA系统代码，以促进AI驱动教育的未来发展。

Abstract: Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback
and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their
effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving
their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA
and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate
students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve
over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages
of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to
identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these
interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to
evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale
empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of
deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader
adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering
future advancements in AI-driven education:

TL;DR: 该研究利用多模态生物特征技术检测在线学习中因使用手机导致的注意力分散问题，结合生理信号和头部姿态数据，多模态模型准确率达91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习平台缺乏详细的行为数据，而多模态学习分析和生物传感器为理解学习者注意力提供了新视角。研究旨在解决学习者在内部、系统和环境因素影响下保持专注的挑战。

Method: 提出一种基于AI的方法，结合生理信号（如脑电波、心率）和头部姿态数据，检测手机使用行为。

Result: 单一生物信号（如脑电波或心率）准确率有限，头部姿态单独准确率为87%，而多模态模型整合所有信号后准确率提升至91%。

Conclusion: 研究讨论了在在线学习环境中实时部署这些模型的潜在影响和局限性，强调了多模态整合的优势。

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在电商领域的广泛应用，数据隐私、算法偏见和消费者自主权等伦理问题日益凸显，亟需建立规范以确保技术应用的公平性与伦理性。

Method: 通过分析主流平台案例，提出定期算法审计、多样化训练数据、引入公平性指标等方法，并设计伦理合规框架。

Result: 提出可操作的最佳实践，如增强算法透明度、保护数据隐私，并制定促进消费者自主权的技术标准。

Conclusion: 需结合伦理标准与技术优化，使AI在电商中的运用既高效又符合道德，推动行业可持续发展。

Abstract: As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation
and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in
personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product
descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored
recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like
Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises
crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias,
and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic
-- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product
recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the
ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations,
emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need
for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best
practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular
audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness
metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical
conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting
transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By
addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in
e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations,
ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound.

*Cedric Bernard,Xavier Pleimling,Amun Kharel,Chase Vickery*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合文本和图像偏见的去偏见模型，通过四个步骤实现：图像文本对齐、图像偏见评分、文本去偏见以及最终的去偏见替换。初步结果显示该方法有效，但仍需更多训练和资源优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政治回音室现象使得从政治文章的文字和图像中检测并消除主观偏见和情绪化语言变得至关重要。以往研究仅关注文本偏见，忽视了图像作为信息传递媒介的重要性。

Method: 模型包含四个步骤：1) 使用CLIP模型进行图像文本对齐；2) 通过ViT分类器对图像偏见评分；3) 利用BERT模型检测并中和文本偏见词汇；4) 最终替换为去偏见后的文本和图像。

Result: 初步结果表明，文本去偏见策略能有效识别潜在偏见词汇，ViT模型训练效果良好，语义对齐模型效率较高。但需更多训练时间和资源以提升效果。

Conclusion: 该多模态去偏见方法展现出潜力，但需进一步优化训练过程，并计划通过人工评估确保生成内容语义一致性。

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

TL;DR: 论文提出Fast-Forwarding技术，通过步骤级自适应减少重复练习，提升学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辅导系统存在过度练习问题，学生花费时间在已掌握的技能上，影响学习效率。

Method: 提出Fast-Forwarding技术，基于学习者模型和问题解决路径模拟研究，优化问题选择算法。

Result: Fast-Forwarding可减少高达三分之一的重复练习，尤其适用于选择高难度问题的算法。

Conclusion: Fast-Forwarding能提升练习效率，但实际效果取决于学生在高难度下的学习动力和参与度。

Abstract: Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the
overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already
mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous
research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem
selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few
efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level
adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose
and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem
selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models
and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding
can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to
complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.
Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection
algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that
preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that
while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its
practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and
engaged at higher levels of difficulty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示历史政策（如带有偏见的保险风险评估方法）如何持续影响现代城市空气污染分布及居民生活质量，尤其关注种族和经济差异。

Method: 结合三种数据源（保险风险评估方法、居民人口统计、人口普查的NO2/PM2.5浓度数据），通过机器学习模型分析650,643名巴尔的摩居民数据。

Result: 结果显示，空气污染水平与历史保险风险评估方法显著相关，低收入社区和有色人种社区的NO2污染差异明显。

Conclusion: 研究表明，数十年前的政策至今仍通过环境不平等对巴尔的摩有色人种社区造成系统性歧视，呼吁政策干预。

Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in
analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed
with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance
risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore
residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The
dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202
major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear
association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities
present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar
disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As
Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the
finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and
affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学学生因缺乏专家指导时间，常出现视觉搜索和诊断解释错误，现有AI系统未能有效解决这些感知错误。

Method: 引入MAARTA框架，动态选择智能体分析学生与专家视线行为差异，并通过逐步提示帮助学生理解错误。

Result: MAARTA能识别遗漏发现并分析差异，提供个性化反馈，改善学生的诊断推理能力。

Conclusion: MAARTA通过多智能体框架和个性化反馈，推动了AI驱动的放射学教育发展。

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球海岸数据集分辨率低（1-4公里），无法满足高精度需求。

Method: 结合公开卫星影像与计算机视觉技术，开发分层迭代地理空间搜索算法库Lighthouse。

Result: 数据集精度提升100倍以上，计算库仅需1CPU/2GB内存即可实现毫秒级响应。

Conclusion: 该方案为资源受限环境下的实时海岸距离计算提供了高精度、高效率的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal
distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal
datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits
their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer
vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at
10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data.
To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale,
we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical
Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both
exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM
to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in
advancing scientific discovery. However, their capability in the fundamental
yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the
NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning
challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the
comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this
gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research.
It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers
published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine
fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code
repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for
implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard
prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the
accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness.
Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit
persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting
critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to autonomously reproduce scientific
research

### [433] [Re-Evaluating Code LLM Benchmarks Under Semantic Mutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17369)
*Zhiyuan Pan,Xing Hu,Xin Xia,Xiaohu Yang*

Conclusion: 设计代码基准测试时需考虑提示敏感性，采用多样化提示模板以确保评估结果的可靠性。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an
important research area in software engineering and are widely used by
practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific
code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step
in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing
code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are
prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could
result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations
of model capabilities.
  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental
designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt
sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that
modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and
their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct
extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative
open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt
templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical
metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings
suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in
performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce
inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These
insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing
future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件开发正经历范式转变，AI和生成式软件重用成为核心，传统方法正被AI辅助方法取代，这可能导致类似'货物崇拜开发'的新形式软件重用。

Method: 通过分析AI辅助生成软件重用的现状，提出相关问题，并定义研究议程和行动呼吁。

Result: 识别了AI辅助生成软件重用的潜在问题，并提出了应对这些问题的研究方向。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以解决AI辅助生成软件重用带来的核心问题，推动'AI原生'软件工程的发展。

Abstract: Software development is currently under a paradigm shift in which artificial
intelligence and generative software reuse are taking the center stage in
software creation. Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods
are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place
their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is
leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that
different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the
implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of
emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and
define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the
central issues associated with this approach.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRAPHIA利用图神经网络改进JavaScript调用图构建，通过链接预测提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript调用图构建工具因语言特性难以分析，既不健全也不完整，导致误报和漏报。

Method: 提出GRAPHIA，将问题建模为全程序图上的链接预测，结合句法和语义边，利用图神经网络建模代码元素间非局部关系。

Result: 在50个流行JavaScript库上评估，GRAPHIA在42%未解析调用点中将正确目标排名第一，72%情况下排名前五。

Conclusion: 基于学习的方法能提高JavaScript调用图构建的召回率，首次将GNN链接预测应用于多文件程序图的跨过程分析。

Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues.
A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model
function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,
existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound
nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges
and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed
call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full
program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our
approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model
non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose
representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and
semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static
call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the
same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine
learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by
ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a
large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges
(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M
structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top
candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,
reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that
learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph
construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link
prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将能源效率作为AI流程设计的首要考虑因素，通过优化五个关键阶段实现显著节能，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的快速发展，计算需求和能源消耗急剧增加。当前优化方法多为事后补救且孤立进行，缺乏对组合效应的系统性考量。

Method: 将能源效率作为核心设计指标，在数据、模型、训练、系统和推理五个AI流程阶段进行正交组合优化。

Result: 实验验证该方法可降低94.6%的能耗，同时保持95.95%的原始F1分数。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了可持续AI的可行框架，平衡了效率、性能和环保责任。

Abstract: AI's exponential growth intensifies computational demands and energy
challenges. While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we
refer as "knobs" in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically
afterthoughts and reactive ad-hoc changes applied in isolation without
understanding their combinatorial effects on energy efficiency. This paper
emphasizes on treating energy efficiency as the first-class citizen and as a
fundamental design consideration for a compute-intensive pipeline. We show that
strategic selection across five AI pipeline phases (data, model, training,
system, inference) creates cascading efficiency. Experimental validation shows
orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to $94.6$% while
preserving $95.95$% of the original F1 score of non-optimized pipelines. This
curated approach provides actionable frameworks for informed sustainable AI
that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

*Lehan He,Zeren Chen,Zhe Zhang,Jing Shao,Xiang Gao,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出Property-Generated Solver框架，通过基于属性的测试（PBT）验证程序属性，替代传统测试驱动开发（TDD），以提升大语言模型生成代码的功能正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试驱动开发（TDD）在大语言模型（LLM）代码生成中存在高质量测试用例稀缺和自动化测试生成偏差的问题，导致代码修正过程可能被误导。

Method: 引入Property-Generated Solver框架，采用两个协作的LLM代理：生成器负责代码生成和迭代优化，测试器管理PBT生命周期并从属性违规中生成语义丰富的反馈。

Result: 在多个代码生成基准测试中，Property-Generated Solver相较于传统TDD方法，pass@1指标相对提升了23.1%至37.3%。

Conclusion: 通过将PBT作为核心验证机制，Property-Generated Solver有效引导LLM生成更正确且可泛化的代码，解决了传统TDD的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their
outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is
a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers
a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the
scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test
generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can
misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated
Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to
validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on
specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define
and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the
"cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are
meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative
LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative
refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate
semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting
comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its
refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within
this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a
robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.
Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks
demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1
improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD
methods.

Motivation: 当前AI代码生成系统中，迭代调试能力虽关键但存在快速衰减问题，需量化评估并优化调试策略。

Method: 引入调试衰减指数(DDI)框架量化失效阈值，提出战略重启策略在关键节点切换探索/利用模式。

Result: DDI揭示了AI调试的根本局限，实验证明适时干预可挽救调试效能，为迭代代码生成提供量化优化框架。

Conclusion: DDI是首个量化调试衰减的框架，战略重启策略能有效突破当前AI调试的效能瓶颈。

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay
pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3
attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical
code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a
mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and
predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from
exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process,
demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of
debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and
provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code
generation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理在自动化复杂软件工程任务（如程序修复和问题解决）中广泛应用，但其内部决策过程仍未被充分探索，限制了对其操作动态和失败模式的理解。

Method: 研究统一了三种先进LLM代理（RepairAgent、AutoCodeRover和OpenHands）的交互日志，捕获了120条轨迹和2822次LLM交互，结合定量分析和定性评估，分析了结构特性、行为模式和语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM代理的决策特征和行为模式，为设计更透明和鲁棒的自主软件工程代理提供了重要参考，并公开了数据集和注释框架以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate
complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution.
These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts,
invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite
their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these
agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their
operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale
empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three
state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent},
\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs
into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions
focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative
analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with
qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We
identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token
consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking
thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and
anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing
actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,
failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and
annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust
autonomous software engineering agents.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在长上下文处理中存在信息衰减和语义碎片化问题，受大脑工作记忆和皮层模块化启发，研究旨在优化模型的长上下文性能。

Method: 提出PaceLLM，包含持久活动机制（模拟前额叶神经元持续放电）和皮层专家聚类（重组FFN权重为语义模块），以解决上下文衰减和语义碎片化。

Result: 在LongBench和Infinite-Bench任务中分别提升6%和12.5-17.5%性能，并在NIAH测试中将可测量上下文长度扩展至200K tokens。

Conclusion: PaceLLM为脑启发的大语言模型优化提供了新思路，可泛化至其他模型，无需结构大改即可提升长上下文性能和可解释性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how
humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many
memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over
possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that
foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,
recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention
-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the
Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural
machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their
convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the
functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to
model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine
translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both
interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show
that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns
as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate
additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search
performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数估计是统计建模的基础步骤，贝叶斯估计能够结合先验信念和观测数据，以概率和鲁棒的方式推断分布参数。特别是在小样本或截断样本中，贝叶斯方法能够提供完整的后验分布，从而量化不确定性和进行正则化。LTLL分布特别适用于建模具有已知下限的时间到事件数据，如降水数据和癌症生存时间。

Method: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法来估计LTLL分布的参数，其中截断点固定为x_L > 0。假设随机变量X ~ LL(α, β; x_L)，其中α和β分别为尺度参数和形状参数。基于截断样本X_1, X_2, ..., X_N（X_i > x_L）推导似然函数，并假设参数的独立先验分布。后验推断通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样（特别是Metropolis-Hastings算法）进行，以获得后验估计α^和β^。

Result: 通过模拟研究和实际应用，结果表明贝叶斯估计在截断分布参数估计中提供了更稳定和可靠的结果，特别是在由于左截断导致似然曲面不规则的情况下。贝叶斯推断在时间到事件数据分析中优于参数不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在估计LTLL分布参数时表现出色，特别是在截断样本中。其能够提供稳定和可靠的参数估计，并量化不确定性，适用于时间到事件数据的建模和分析。

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a foundational step in statistical modeling, enabling
us to extract knowledge from data and apply it effectively. Bayesian estimation
of parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer
distribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides
full posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and
regularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the
left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for
modeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower
bound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we
propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL
distribution with a fixed truncation point \( x_L > 0 \). Given a random
variable \( X \sim LL(\alpha, \beta; x_L) \), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is the
scale parameter and \( \beta > 0 \) is the shape parameter, the likelihood
function is derived based on a truncated sample \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N \) with
\( X_i > x_L \). We assume independent prior distributions for the parameters,
and the posterior inference is conducted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
specifically using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior
estimates \( \hat{\alpha} \) and \( \hat{\beta} \). Through simulation studies
and real-world applications, we demonstrate that Bayesian estimation provides
more stable and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when the likelihood
surface is irregular due to left truncation. The results highlight the
advantages of Bayesian inference outperform the estimation of parameter
uncertainty in truncated distributions for time to event data analysis.

Conclusion: GRASP通过直接控制尾部行为和简化层次结构，提供了一种高效且灵活的分组回归解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GRASP, a simple Bayesian framework for regression with grouped
predictors, built on the normal beta prime (NBP) prior. The NBP prior is an
adaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters
that control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong
shrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the
group inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into
structured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is
sufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the
non-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the
NBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive
sparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel
framework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within
a group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also
introduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter
estimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the
robustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with
varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has
completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.

*Alexandre Le Nepvou*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分层实现的新型模态逻辑框架SAL，替代传统的可能世界模型，通过分层索引模态操作符来捕捉实现的动态性与不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Kripke语义将模态操作符视为对完全确定替代方案的量化，忽略了实现的局部性、动态性和不对称性。本文旨在构建一个更贴合实际实现过程的模态逻辑系统。

Method: 提出分层实现逻辑（SAL），通过将模态操作符按本体稳定性层级索引，并基于层级间转换的内部一致性定义语法和语义，引入公理并证明其可靠性和完备性。

Result: SAL系统成功摆脱了对抽象可能世界的依赖，能够描述时间生成、量子退相干领域和模态形而上学中的实现结构。

Conclusion: SAL为标准模态实在论提供了分层替代方案，更精准地刻画了实现的本体结构，具有理论创新和应用潜力。

Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of
stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible
worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification
over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often
asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified
Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了面向化学领域的RAG系统中文本分块策略和嵌入模型，发现递归基于令牌的分块和检索优化嵌入模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG系统在科学文献处理中日益重要，但针对特定领域（如化学）的基础设计选择（如文档分块和表示方法）仍缺乏深入研究。

Method: 研究评估了25种分块配置（涵盖5种方法族）和48种嵌入模型，使用三个化学领域基准（包括新提出的QuestChemRetrieval数据集）进行测试。

Result: 递归基于令牌的分块策略（R100-0）表现最优，且检索优化嵌入模型（如Nomic和Intfloat E5变体）显著优于领域专用模型（如SciBERT）。

Conclusion: 通过公开数据集、评估框架和实证基准，该研究为构建高效化学领域RAG系统提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for
navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in
high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational
design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain
underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first
large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models
tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking
configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on
three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced
QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based
chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches,
offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that
retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants --
substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing
our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide
actionable guidelines for building effective and efficient chemistry-aware RAG
systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CORONA的新方法，通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力和图神经网络（GNNs）的高阶交互关系捕捉能力，在推荐系统的候选筛选过程中提升性能。实验表明，该方法在召回率和NDCG指标上平均提升了18.6%和18.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推荐系统研究虽然尝试利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来增强推荐效果，但主要局限于重新排序结果或数据集增强，未能充分发挥LLMs在候选筛选阶段的潜力，导致性能不佳。因此，作者提出在候选筛选过程中利用LLMs的推理能力，以提升推荐系统的整体性能。

Method: 论文提出了CORONA框架，分三步进行候选筛选：(1) LLM基于用户画像进行偏好推理，提取相关用户和物品；(2) LLM结合上一步的检索信息和目标用户的购买历史进行意图推理，进一步缩小交互子图；(3) 使用GNN从提取的子图中捕捉高阶协同过滤信息，生成最终推荐结果。

Result: 在多个数据集和设置下的实验表明，CORONA在召回率和NDCG指标上分别实现了18.6%和18.4%的相对提升，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CORONA框架成功地将LLMs的推理能力与GNNs的高阶关系捕捉能力相结合，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，为推荐系统的研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user
might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As
large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains,
researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior
work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to
utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal
performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during
the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs
(CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on
interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference
reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to
extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as
preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the
previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts
intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as
intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order
collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing
GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The
proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the
retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall
recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative
improvement in NDCG on average.

*Jiale Zhang,Jiaxiang Chen,Zhucong Li,Jie Ding,Kui Zhao,Zenglin Xu,Xin Pang,Yinghui Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SlimRAG提出了一种轻量级的检索增强生成框架，通过实体感知机制替代复杂的图结构，提高了检索效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图的RAG系统存在结构复杂和检索不精确的问题，主要因为语义相似性不等于语义相关性。

Method: SlimRAG采用实体感知机制，构建实体到文本块的紧凑表，通过语义嵌入进行检索，避免图遍历和边构建。

Result: 实验表明，SlimRAG在多个QA基准测试中优于基于图和扁平结构的基线模型，同时减少了索引大小和检索内容的冗余。

Conclusion: SlimRAG证明了无结构、以实体为中心的上下文选择在检索效率和准确性上的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

Motivation: COVID-19疫情导致相关文献激增，需高效检索系统在突发疫情时快速提供有用信息。

Method: 采用大语言模型（LLMs）解析现有工具无法识别的未标注文献内部隐藏关系。

Result: 系统在检索过程中能获取更多有效信息，提高搜索结果质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLMs增强检索系统能力，为突发公共卫生事件研究提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive
volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide
researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the
retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search
results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the
system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.

Motivation: 由于摘要段落较长且候选摘要间高度相似，准确预测引用文献具有挑战性。

Method: 首先基于关系特征检索最相似的k篇摘要，再利用大语言模型精准识别最相关引用。

Result: 在SCIDOCA 2025提供的训练数据集上验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统能有效解决引用预测难题。

Abstract: The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation
from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem
from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among
candidate abstracts, making it difficult to determine the exact paper to cite.
To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most
similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given
paragraph. From this subset, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to
accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its
effectiveness in citation prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数增长使研究者难以有效提取和综合知识，传统搜索引擎和通用LLM存在答案简短、缺乏深度或信息过时的问题。

Method: WISE采用基于LLM的树状架构，通过动态评分、排名和自适应停止标准，提取查询对齐、上下文感知且非冗余的信息。

Result: 实验表明，WISE在HBB基因相关疾病案例中减少80%以上文本处理量，召回率显著高于基线，且输出更具独特性和深度。

Conclusion: WISE能高效从非结构化科学文献中提取知识，并适用于药物发现、材料科学等多个领域。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers
extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many
sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer
concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search
capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete
answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific
Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured
workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an
LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned,
context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking
prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping
criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized
answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse
sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces
processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over
baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU
metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel
level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore
how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery,
material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction
and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中，用户在不同场景（如首页、搜索页等）的兴趣可能不一致，导致统一建模困难。

Method: 采用Double Q-learning提升下一项预测精度，并利用Q值优化对比学习损失以改进模型性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在多场景推荐任务中超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 为多场景建模提供了新视角，并指出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: In real-world recommendation systems, users would engage in variety
scenarios, such as homepages, search pages, and related recommendation pages.
Each of these scenarios would reflect different aspects users focus on.
However, the user interests may be inconsistent in different scenarios, due to
differences in decision-making processes and preference expression. This
variability complicates unified modeling, making multi-scenario learning a
significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning approach that models user preferences across scenarios by modeling
user interest evolution across multiple scenarios. Our method employs Double
Q-learning to enhance next-item prediction accuracy and optimizes contrastive
learning loss using Q-value to make model performance better. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
multi-scenario recommendation tasks. Our work offers a fresh perspective on
multi-scenario modeling and highlights promising directions for future
research.

Motivation: 当前推荐系统中的文本摘要任务（如生成简洁的产品标题）面临核心特征相关性低和严格字数限制的挑战，现有大型语言模型方法无法直接适用。

Method: 提出CARTS框架，采用三阶段多代理协作流程：生成增强生成(GAG)、迭代精炼圈和仲裁，分别负责特征提取、基于反馈的标题优化和最终选择。

Result: 在电商数据和A/B测试中，CARTS在标题相关性和用户参与指标上显著优于单次生成和思维链基线模型。

Conclusion: CARTS通过结构化多代理协作有效解决了推荐系统文本摘要的特殊需求，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data
summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product
carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have
shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not
directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly
relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit
constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for
Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for
structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task
into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and
arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting
salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance
and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative
arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B
testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and
chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved
user engagement metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协同过滤缺乏即时需求交互能力，会话推荐系统缺乏个性化信号，两者结合可提升推荐效果，但缺乏大规模真实对话数据集支持。

Method: ConvRecStudio采用三阶段流程：时序画像构建用户和社区级情感轨迹，语义对话规划生成结构化对话计划，多轮模拟通过LLM代理生成对话。

Result: 在三个领域生成超过12K多轮对话，人工和自动评估证实对话自然性和一致性，联合编码模型在Hit@1指标上提升10.9%。

Conclusion: ConvRecStudio有效统一协同过滤和会话推荐，生成高质量对话数据，显著提升推荐性能。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms:
collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from
historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which
interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each
captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack
collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,
traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate
needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains
challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in
real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large
language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in
timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a
three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles
and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)
Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of
flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the
plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by
executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three
domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K
multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the
naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated
conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer
model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in
Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion.
Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the
strongest baseline.

TL;DR: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）扩展信息检索中的相关性判断，显著减少人工标注需求，并在医学领域取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息检索系统评估依赖高成本的人工相关性判断，尤其在医学等多模态复杂领域。研究旨在利用MLLM减少对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 采用Gemini 1.5 Pro模型，通过结构化提示策略（二元评分、指令评估和少样本学习）模拟人工评估，扩展ImageCLEFmed 2013数据集的相关性判断。

Result: MLLM与人工判断的Cohen's Kappa一致性达0.6，数据集从15,028扩展到558,653条判断，相关标注从4.72%增至5,950条，每查询平均新增15,398条标注。

Conclusion: MLLM能有效扩展相关性判断规模，为医学及多模态信息检索任务提供高效评估支持。

Abstract: Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual
relevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.
While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially
labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to
reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like
medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing
both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating
a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on
the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment
through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates
binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We
systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize
agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and
human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score
of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in
multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments
(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset
by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On
average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with
approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in
this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance
judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval
evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.

Conclusion: FAIRBridge为研究人员提供了一个强大的新工具，帮助他们推进研究，通过自主查询处理框架和社区驱动的众包管理，提升科学数据的使用效率。

Abstract: Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,
offering researchers a powerful new tool for advancing their inquiries.

*Haotong Du,Yaqing Wang,Fei Xiong,Lei Shao,Ming Liu,Hao Gu,Quanming Yao,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PERSCEN提出了一种多场景匹配新方法，通过用户特定建模和图神经网络捕捉跨场景偏好，结合向量量化技术提取场景感知偏好，实现高效个性化推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多场景推荐方法常忽略用户特定建模，导致个性化表示不足。为降低维护成本并缓解数据稀疏性，需同时捕捉跨场景共享偏好和场景特定偏好。

Method: PERSCEN构建用户特征图，用轻量图神经网络提取高阶交互模式；采用向量量化技术从行为序列中蒸馏场景感知偏好，并通过渐进式门控单元实现细粒度信息融合。

Result: 实验表明PERSCEN优于现有方法，效率分析证实其在性能与计算成本间取得平衡，适合工业级系统部署。

Conclusion: PERSCEN通过用户特定建模和场景感知偏好融合，显著提升多场景推荐效果，兼具实用性和计算效率。

Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms,
multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance
costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario
recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all
scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,
existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation
of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an
innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into
multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based
on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to
capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of
preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector
quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'
behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and
scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible
information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear
unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency
analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with
computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial
systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出LettinGo框架，利用大语言模型生成多样化、自适应的用户画像，通过直接偏好优化提升推荐系统的准确性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于嵌入的用户画像缺乏可解释性和适应性，现有文本画像方法受限于固定格式，无法全面捕捉用户行为多样性。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1) 多LLM探索多样化画像 2) 基于推荐效果评估画像质量 3) 通过任务表现的成对偏好数据对齐生成器。使用DPO替代监督微调。

Result: 实验表明该框架显著提升推荐准确性、灵活性和上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: LettinGo通过创新画像生成方法，为下一代推荐系统提供了关键技术突破。

Abstract: User profiling is pivotal for recommendation systems, as it transforms raw
user interaction data into concise and structured representations that drive
personalized recommendations. While traditional embedding-based profiles lack
interpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models
(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more
transparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit
their ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,
we introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive
user profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating
direct feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the
rigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with
task-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and
effective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user
profiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their
impact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation
through pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation
accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile
generation as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种公平感知的重新排序方法，用于减少推荐系统中的偏见，特别是在不同项目类别和多个敏感属性（如性别、年龄和职业）上的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在多个领域对用户体验有重要影响，但现有研究在解决偏见时忽略了某些项目类别，且多数工作仅关注二元敏感属性。

Method: 提出了一种公平感知的重新排序方法，利用现有偏见来纠正不同人口群体之间的推荐差异。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效减少社会偏见，且几乎不影响推荐性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不显著降低性能的情况下，有效缓解推荐系统中的多维度偏见问题。

Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting
user experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job
advertisements, entertainment, etc. Given the vital role of such systems in our
lives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced
recommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked
bias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.
Additionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive
attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
fairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different
categories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to
correct disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We
show how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,
including gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world
datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating
bias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate
social bias with little to no degradation in performance.

### [466] [When concept-based XAI is imprecise: Do people distinguish between generalisations and misrepresentations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17936)
*Romy Müller*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现，人们难以自发识别AI概念解释中的泛化行为，且对相关特征的不精确性高度敏感，这可能影响对AI模型理解能力的判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在复杂任务（如安全评估）中，基于概念的可解释AI（C-XAI）能否通过展示概念的变异性来体现AI的泛化能力，以及人们是否能识别并欣赏这种泛化。

Method: 通过铁路安全场景实验，参与者评估模拟AI的性能，AI通过提供相似图像片段作为概念来解释其决策，这些概念在匹配分类图像时存在不同形式的不精确性。

Result: 与假设相反，对不相关特征泛化的概念评分低于精确匹配的概念，且与系统性误表征的概念评分相当；参与者对相关特征的不精确性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 人们可能无法自发识别概念解释中的泛化行为，因此难以通过C-XAI概念推断AI模型是否真正理解了复杂情境。

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

TL;DR: 该论文通过PRISMA引导的范围综述，系统分析了71篇关于机器伴侣（MC）的学术文献，提出了MC的正式定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器伴侣在社交媒体和技术想象中广泛存在，但缺乏对其作为正式概念或测量变量的深入研究。

Method: 采用PRISMA引导的范围综述方法，系统筛选、调查并综合了2017年至2025年间71篇关于机器伴侣的学术文献。

Result: 研究发现，不同文献对机器伴侣的定义和测量变量差异较大，最终提出了MC的定义：一种自主的、协调的人机连接，随时间展开且主观积极。

Conclusion: 论文为机器伴侣提供了一个基于文献的正式定义，强调了其自主性、协调性和主观积极性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

TL;DR: AI Harmonizer利用生成式AI技术，无需用户输入和声信息，自动生成四部和声，为独唱旋律增添丰富的合唱效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统和声生成工具需要用户具备一定的音乐专业知识，手动指定调性或通过外部键盘选择和声。本文旨在开发一种无需用户输入即可自动生成和声的系统，降低使用门槛。

Method: 结合先进的生成式AI技术（音高检测和声音建模）与定制训练的符号音乐模型，系统能够将任意人声旋律自动编排为丰富的合唱织体。

Result: AI Harmonizer能够离线生成音乐上连贯的四部和声，为表演和作曲提供新的可能性。

Conclusion: 该系统代表了AI辅助人声表演和音乐表达增强的重要一步，未来将探索实时实现的可能性。代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

external controller. We discuss our results and propose directions for future
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于EEG的假肢控制系统存在信号噪声、分类准确性和实时适应性等问题，BRAVE旨在解决这些问题，提供更直观、稳定的非侵入性假肢控制方案。

Method: BRAVE采用LSTM、CNN和随机森林的集成学习框架进行EEG分类，结合ICA和CSP进行信号预处理，并引入语音识别实现模式切换，系统延迟为150毫秒。

Result: BRAVE在测试中实现了96%的分类准确率，响应延迟为150毫秒，适用于多种用户，并在低功耗嵌入式设备上优化部署。

Conclusion: BRAVE为非侵入性假肢控制提供了实时、鲁棒的解决方案，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 该论文通过结合主动学习的矩张量势和贝叶斯热力学推断的方法，证实了钛-钒二元合金存在体心立方（BCC）混溶间隙，且该间隙并非由氧杂质引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钛-钒（Ti-V）二元合金是否存在体心立方（BCC）混溶间隙存在争议，有假设认为混溶间隙是由合金制备过程中的氧污染引起的。本文旨在通过计算和机器学习方法解决这一争议。

Method: 采用从头算+机器学习的流程，结合主动学习的矩张量势和贝叶斯热力学推断方法，模拟了Ti-V二元系统在整个成分范围内的热力学性质。

Result: 计算得到的相图再现了所有实验特征，明确支持存在BCC混溶间隙的变体，该间隙在T=980 K和c=0.67时终止。模拟中排除了氧的影响，证明间隙并非由杂质效应引起。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明Ti-V二元合金确实存在BCC混溶间隙，且该间隙与氧污染无关，反驳了最近的CALPHAD重新评估结果。

Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V)
binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains
completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to
oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we
use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained
Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this
workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range,
together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting
diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of
our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap
terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from
simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting
recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Conclusion: 该研究证明了残差连接在深度时空网络中对电化学系统建模的有效性，为电池诊断提供了强大工具，有助于实时监测和优化锂电池性能。未来研究可扩展该框架至其他电池化学体系，并与实际实验数据结合进一步验证。

Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and
safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity
degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model
to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational
efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model
mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across
layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and
macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field
model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental
results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and
significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional
ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This
highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal
networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a
robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring
and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend
this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world
experimental data for further validation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统晶体属性预测方法（如实验或DFT计算）资源消耗大，而现有机器学习模型依赖标注数据且缺乏物理原理整合，限制了其泛化能力和可解释性。

Method: 开发了CLOUD框架，采用SCOPE编码晶体对称性、Wyckoff位置和成分，预训练于600万晶体结构，并通过微调应用于多种下游任务。结合Debye模型实现热力学一致性。

Result: CLOUD在多种材料属性预测任务中表现优异，CLOUD-DEBYE框架无需额外数据即可预测温度依赖性属性，展示了其可扩展性和物理一致性。

Conclusion: CLOUD作为对称性一致与物理基础学习统一的可扩展模型，为晶体材料属性预测和发现提供了新范式。

Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding
structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional
materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental
measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often
resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models
offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property
relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models
often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential
structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical
principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability.
Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable
materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel
Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal
symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free
string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures,
CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive
performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating
strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable
materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and
heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic
consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and
enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional
data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and
physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying
symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for
property prediction and materials discovery.

TL;DR: HackNIP提出了一种两阶段混合方法，利用预训练的神经网络原子间势（NIP）生成特征向量，再训练浅层机器学习模型，以解决材料科学中结构到性质预测的通用性与数据需求之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模基础模型（如NIP）在加速原子模拟方面表现出色，但它们在直接预测电子性质和宏观性质时面临挑战。传统机器学习方法在通用性和数据需求之间存在权衡，因此需要一种更高效的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: HackNIP采用两阶段流程：首先从预训练的NIP基础模型中提取固定长度的特征向量（嵌入），然后利用这些嵌入训练浅层机器学习模型，用于下游的结构到性质预测任务。

Result: HackNIP在Matbench上进行了基准测试，展示了其在数据效率和多任务（包括ab initio、实验和分子性质）上的优越性能，同时分析了嵌入深度对性能的影响。

Conclusion: HackNIP通过混合策略成功克服了材料科学中机器学习的通用性与数据需求之间的权衡，为高性能预测建模的普及提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic
potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated
significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic
simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties
and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for
macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for
structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often
lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and
computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a
two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts
fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then
uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream
structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a
hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep
neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning
approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP
embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on
Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including
\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how

### [475] [Wisdom of Crowds Through Myopic Self-Confidence Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18195)
*Giacomo Como,Fabio Fagnani,Anton Proskurnikov*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文研究了群体智慧现象，探讨了在非贝叶斯学习规则下，个体如何通过迭代更新估计来最小化其估计方差，并分析了帕累托前沿和纳什均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体智慧现象表明，群体的集体判断可能比个体判断更准确。然而，如果个体意见受到少数有影响力个体的驱动，群体决策的准确性会显著降低。本文旨在研究个体如何在迭代更新估计的过程中，通过优化权重分配来最小化估计方差。

Method: 本文采用非贝叶斯学习规则（French-DeGroot动力学或迭代意见池）作为个体更新估计的方法。个体通过迭代分布式平均过程，逐步调整对世界状态的估计，并优化权重分配以最小化估计方差。

Result: 本文刻画了帕累托前沿和纳什均衡集，并证明了异步最佳响应动态会收敛到严格纳什均衡集。

Conclusion: 通过优化权重分配，个体可以在群体智慧现象中实现更准确的估计。帕累托前沿和纳什均衡的分析为群体决策提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the
collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the
individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example
illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by
Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an
ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This
phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on
independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be
significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few
influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess
uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.
Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple
non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the
French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this
iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic
estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate
determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every
agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state
of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights
allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents
must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined
by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto
frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we
examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove
their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and
presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The
discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions
degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied
to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has
been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing
multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization
approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault
features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific
multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect
fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the
extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely
studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact
on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the
model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall
generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing
end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically
in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a
real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,
aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant
operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with
a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant
fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the
source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于状态增强图神经网络（GNN）的资源分配方法，通过将网络配置表示为图并利用动态输入的双变量，克服了传统双次梯度方法的不足，并在功率控制案例中展示了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多用户无线网络中，资源分配问题需要优化网络范围的效用函数，同时满足用户平均性能的约束。传统双次梯度方法存在局限性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来改进资源分配策略。

Method: 论文采用状态增强的GNN参数化方法，将网络状态表示为图，并将双变量作为动态输入。通过离线训练学习拉格朗日最大化策略，并在推理阶段通过梯度更新优化双变量。此外，利用次级GNN参数化实现双变量回归，以加速推理。

Conclusion: 通过状态增强GNN和双变量优化，论文提出了一种高效的资源分配方法，显著提升了训练和推理性能，为无线网络资源管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks,
where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to
constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a
state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource
allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient
methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and
viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals
supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are
learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve
through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies
during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how
near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be
accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN
parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers
sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of
state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit
power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential
probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality
gaps.

Motivation: 低秩矩阵补全问题在机器学习、统计学和理论计算机科学等多个领域有广泛应用。然而，现有研究在特定约束条件下的计算复杂性尚未完全解决，尤其是半正定性和有界无穷范数约束下的NP难性。

Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with
missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is
close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy
additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a
bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including
machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad
real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix
completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and
any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial
matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive
semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a
positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an
additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to
exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,
and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than
$2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is
constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive
semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity
assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel
notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line
digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.

Conclusion: QSVM在ICS异常检测中具有显著优势，可提升关键基础设施的安全性和完整性。

Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role
in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of
anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning
is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based
machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous
behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of
quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid
Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform
traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores.
Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real
IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels.
This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics.
Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in
kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential
"quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This
effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly
detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical
infrastructures.

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,
with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex
engineering systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

Motivation: 随着人工智能的爆炸性增长，数据中心规模达到吉瓦级别，其功率波动在几秒内可超过500兆瓦，毫秒级波动可达设计热功率的50-75%，这对电力系统运行提出了根本性挑战。传统VPP架构无法处理这种极端的动态波动，因此需要新的理论框架。

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale
data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting
power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale
variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a
comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24
hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to
converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that
traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000
MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces
with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2)
new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service
availability above 99.95%.
  This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable
integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center
electricity consumption by 2030.

Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical
processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of
computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models,
which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived
via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as
a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of
dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate
data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an
incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples
the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and
conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1)
regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for
flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between
variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning
techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and
data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model
structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows
for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies
are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our
incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited
data.

Motivation: 随着分布式可再生能源的普及，基于电力电子的分布式发电机取代了同步发电机，导致微电网动态特性变化，尤其是系统惯性和阻尼降低。虚拟同步发电机虽能模拟同步发电机的动态行为，但固定参数无法保证频率调节在可接受范围内。因此，需要动态调整这些虚拟参数以实现稳定的频率调节。

Conclusion: 动态调整虚拟同步发电机参数的方法有效解决了微电网因可再生能源渗透导致的频率调节问题，提高了系统的稳定性和响应速度。

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery
time.

Conclusion: 连续时间步进的PINNs框架能有效解决大时间跨度的热传递问题，为工程热模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for
the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce
the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a
continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time
interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized.
On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition
for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this
framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without
increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used
to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving
heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with
traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.

Conclusion: 结论是，所提出的DPG损失函数不仅适用于特定椭圆PDE示例，还可广泛应用于存在稳定DPG公式的问题，特别是在高对比度扩散场中表现出色。

Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions
for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of
parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our
primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction
capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by
the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example
of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a
loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG)
discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed
concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which
stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion
fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both
numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast
diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust
performance than simpler least-squares losses.

Conclusion: 该替代模型在动力学和平衡态两种机制下均表现出鲁棒性，为甲烷蒸汽重整的设计和过程优化提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for
efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used
technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where
hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and
optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models
typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their
applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes.
An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes
experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data,
and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data
augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced
training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the
optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the
post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean
squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927.
The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions
makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results
confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming
in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design
and process optimization.

### [488] [A Study of Dynamic Stock Relationship Modeling and S&P500 Price Forecasting Based on Differential Graph Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18717)
*Linyue Hu,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为差分图变换器（DGT）的新框架，用于动态建模股票关系并进行价格预测，通过结合差分图机制和多头自注意力，有效捕捉股票间的动态相关性，并在实验中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测对投资决策和风险管理至关重要，但由于市场的非线性动态和时变的股票间相关性，传统静态相关性模型难以捕捉这些变化。因此，需要一种能够动态建模股票关系的方法来提高预测准确性。

Method: 论文提出差分图变换器（DGT）框架，通过差分图机制将序列图结构变化整合到多头自注意力中，自适应地保留高价值连接并抑制噪声。同时，使用因果时间注意力捕捉价格序列的全局和局部依赖性，并评估了多种相关性度量（如Pearson、互信息、Spearman、Kendall's Tau）作为空间注意力的先验。

Result: 在10年标普500收盘价数据上的实验表明，DGT框架优于GRU基线（RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87）。Kendall's Tau全局矩阵表现最佳（MAE: 0.11）。聚类分析揭示了“高波动增长”和“防御性蓝筹”股票，后者因相关性稳定而误差更低（RMSE: 0.13）。

Conclusion: 该研究创新性地将差分图结构与变换器结合，验证了动态关系建模的有效性，并确定了最优相关性度量和范围。聚类分析支持定制化量化策略，为金融时间序列预测和跨资产交互分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,
yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying
inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture
evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph
Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price
prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into
multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively
preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal
attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further
evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's
Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10
years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),
DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).
Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means
clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks,
with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.
Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study
innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,
validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation
metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.
Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic
modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.

*Huan Liu,Pengfei Jiao,Mengzhou Gao,Chaochao Chen,Di Jin*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的异质时序超图神经网络（HTHGN），用于捕捉复杂异质时序图中的高阶交互关系，解决了现有方法忽略高阶拓扑信息和静态同质图限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图表示学习方法主要关注低阶拓扑信息，而忽略了与真实网络更一致的高阶群体交互关系。此外，大多数超图方法仅能建模静态同质图，限制了其在异质时序图中建模高阶交互的能力。

Method: 论文首先提出了异质时序超图的正式定义和不依赖额外信息的P-uniform异质超边构建算法。然后，提出了一种新型的HTHGN网络，通过分层注意力机制模块在异质节点和超边之间进行时序消息传递，以捕捉更广泛的语义信息。此外，HTHGN通过对比学习最大化低阶相关异质节点对的一致性，以避免低阶结构模糊问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界的异质时序图数据集上的详细实验结果验证了HTHGN在建模高阶交互关系方面的有效性，并展示了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: HTHGN能够有效捕捉异质时序图中的高阶交互关系，解决了现有方法的局限性，并在实验中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for
modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in
real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous
temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful
applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus
on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order
group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world
networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static
homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in
HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order
interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of
heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge
construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a
novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to
fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical
attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal
message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich
semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN
performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order
correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural
ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order
interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

*Jinhao Gu,Ángel F. García-Fernández,Robert E. Firth,Lennart Svensson*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于测量不同大小图之间距离的图度量家族，扩展了图GOSPA度量，并通过线性编程近似计算，实验验证了其在分类任务中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图GOSPA度量在处理边不匹配时惩罚不够灵活，需要更通用的度量方法来更准确地衡量图间距离。

Method: 提出了一种通用的图GOSPA度量家族，通过线性编程近似计算，并引入更灵活的边不匹配惩罚机制。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的度量家族在不同超参数选择下表现良好，并在真实数据集上提升了分类任务性能。

Conclusion: 图GOSPA度量家族提供了一种灵活且有效的方法来衡量图间距离，适用于分类等实际应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between
graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of
the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also
proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric,
the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs
for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes.
However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for
edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the
graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear
programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the
characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different
choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric
family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.

*Mostafa Shahin,Beena Ahmed,Julien Epps*

TL;DR: 提出首个基于零样本学习的语音认知障碍检测方法，利用Qwen2-AudioLLM模型实现跨语言、跨数据集的通用性检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知障碍早期检测对干预至关重要，传统方法依赖有监督模型和人工标注，泛化性差。语音作为非侵入性生物标志物具有潜力。

Method: 使用Qwen2-AudioLLM多模态模型，通过设计提示指令实现零样本分类，支持音频和文本输入，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在英语和多语言数据集上达到与有监督方法相当的性能，展现跨语言、任务和数据集的良好一致性。

Conclusion: 零样本AudioLLM方法突破了传统检测的局限性，为认知障碍筛查提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过自动语音识别（ASR）转录歌词来检测AI生成音乐的方法，相比现有音频检测方法更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成工具的快速发展，音乐行业亟需准确检测AI生成内容的方法。现有音频检测方法在泛化性和抗干扰性上表现不佳，且依赖完美格式的歌词数据库，实际应用受限。

Method: 使用通用自动语音识别（ASR）模型转录歌曲歌词，结合多种检测器（如Whisper large-v2和LLM2Vec嵌入）进行分析。

Result: 在多语言、多流派的歌词数据集上表现出色，尤其在音频受干扰或面对不同音乐生成器时，优于现有音频检测方法。

Conclusion: 基于ASR转录歌词的检测方法填补了实际应用空白，对AI生成音乐具有更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种利用大语言模型（LLM）处理语音不流畅性的新方法，通过结合声学特征和文本输入生成带时间戳的完整注释转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检测口语中的不流畅性对提升自动语音和语言处理系统性能至关重要，同时促进更具包容性的语音和语言技术发展。

Method: 整合音频编码器提取的声学表征与不同质量的文本输入（如干净转录、时间对齐转录或ASR模型输出），利用LLM生成带时间戳的不流畅性注释转录。

Result: 实验表明，即使文本输入不完美，只要包含时间戳相关线索，LLM仍能有效生成完整的不流畅性注释转录，展现其处理不完美提示的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLM结合多模态输入，实现了对语音不流畅性的高效标注，为语音处理系统提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

Motivation: 针对作曲家风格音乐生成中数据稀缺的挑战，研究如何利用从广泛音乐语料库中学到的通用音乐知识来增强对特定作曲家风格的掌握。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：首先在大规模流行、民谣和古典音乐语料库上预训练基于REMI的音乐生成模型，然后在四位著名作曲家的小型人工验证数据集上通过轻量适配器模块进行风格微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在风格准确性和音乐性上均优于消融实验和基线模型，实现了更精确的作曲家风格建模和更好的音乐美学效果。

Conclusion: 通过通用性预训练和风格微调，模型能够有效构建音乐概念并细化风格理解，为数据稀缺的控制模态音乐生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

Method: 采用两阶段持续预训练策略，结合学习率重新升温与衰减，使用650小时多文化音乐数据进行训练，并探索任务算术作为替代方法。

Result: 模型在非西方音乐自动标注任务上平均提升4.9%的ROC-AUC和AP，多文化适应模型整体表现最佳，任务算术方法表现相当且无西方数据退化。

Conclusion: CultureMERT-95M及其变体有效提升了跨文化音乐理解，公开模型以促进文化感知音乐基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation
learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains
limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation
model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music
foundation models.

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to
the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high
background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic
properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we
propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the
distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world
underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel
spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT)
features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model
performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively
adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels
across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the
model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it
in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain
for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater
sound localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的尺度不变信噪比（SDR）损失函数可能无法保留对音素可懂度至关重要的细粒度频谱线索，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了时频域中基于感知的SDR损失函数变体，采用固定和自适应频率加权策略，包括ANSI频带重要性权重、频谱幅度加权和基于语音与噪声相对量的动态加权。

Result: 实验结果表明，虽然标准指标如SDR仅略有改善，但其感知频率加权对应指标有显著提升，且频谱和音素级分析显示辅音重建更好。

Conclusion: 提出的感知加权SDR损失函数能更好地保留关键声学线索，尤其在辅音重建方面表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到音乐生成模型在时间相关条件控制上表现不佳，尤其是当条件随时间变化时。作者发现位置嵌入在时间函数条件中至关重要，但现有模型很少使用。

Method: 在解耦的交叉注意力层中添加旋转位置嵌入，以更少的可训练参数（仅8500万）实现对时间变化音乐属性和参考音频信号的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将旋律控制精度从56.6%提升至61.1%，且训练参数比现有技术少6.75倍，同时在音乐属性控制、音频修复和扩展方面表现优于MusicGen-Large和Stable Audio Open ControlNet。

Conclusion: MuseControlLite以更低的微调成本实现了更高的控制精度，为文本到音乐生成模型的时间相关条件控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

Conclusion: AbRank为机器学习模型在抗体-抗原空间中的泛化提供了坚实基础，对可扩展、结构感知的抗体治疗设计具有直接意义。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential
for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current
models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions,
and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We
introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that
reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates
over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse
antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized
data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local
perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel
antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an
m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal
affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold
difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we
introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein
language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise
binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current
methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that
ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,
AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize
across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,
structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.
