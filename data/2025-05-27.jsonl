In our approach, we (1) consider the fact\nthat most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of\ncalibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique\nprobability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model,\n(3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources\nwhile calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable\nlatent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance\nof our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the\npotential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple\ncomputer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is\nprone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are\nnormally constrained by underlying physics."}

By breaking down each daily demand curve into a\nbaseline component and distinct peak components, the proposed SGD method\ncharacterizes each peak with interpretable parameters, including peak\namplitude, timing (mean), spread (duration), and skewness (asymmetry), thereby\nreconstructing the observed pattern and uncovering latent usage dynamics. This\ndetailed peak-level decomposition enables both operational applications, e.g.\nanomaly and leakage detection, real-time demand management, and strategic\nanalyses, e.g. identifying behavioral shifts, seasonal influences, or policy\nimpacts on consumption patterns. Unlike traditional symmetric Gaussian or\npurely statistical time-series models, SGDs explicitly capture asymmetric peak\nshapes such as sharp morning surges followed by gradual declines, improving the\nfidelity of synthetic pattern generation and enhancing the detection of\nirregular consumption behavior.

Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or\nemergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by\na structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains\nhidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.\nThe theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \\(\n\\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \\), where each system \\( S \\) possesses its own latent\nstructure \\( P_S \\), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed\nirregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through\nobserver-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \\( \\varepsilon_S(t) \\)\nas a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from\nthe system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of\nrepresentation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos\ntheory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or\nmodel shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every\ninstance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the\ntheory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it\ninvites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by\ndistinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient\nresolution.

We evaluate six large language models GPT 4o, GPT\n4o mini, o3 mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1 685B, and DeepSeek V3 685B under\nfour configurations: zero shot and chain of thought, each in Spanish and\nEnglish. The top models (o3 mini, DeepSeek R1 685B, DeepSeek V3 685B) achieve\nover 70% accuracy, whereas LLaMA 3.3 70B and GPT-4o mini remain below 40%. Most\nmodels show no significant performance drop between languages, with GPT 4o even\nperforming better on Spanish problems in the zero shot setting. Geometry,\nCombinatorics, and Probability questions remain persistently challenging for\nall models. These results highlight the need for native-language benchmarks and\ndomain-specific evaluations to reveal reasoning failures not captured by\nstandard metrics."}

To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting\n(DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss.\nIn our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty\nand then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length,\nyielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we\ncurate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning\nexamples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude\nshorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of\nreasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5\narchitecture.

Hence, a natural idea to improve efficiency is to reduce the\nunit number. Yet, the fact that the thinking units in vanilla CoT cannot be\nexplicitly managed renders doing so challenging. This paper introduces\nMulti-Turn Decomposition (MinD) to decode conventional CoT into a sequence of\nexplicit, structured, and turn-wise interactions to bridge the gap. In MinD,\nthe model provides a multi-turn response to the query, where each turn embraces\na thinking unit and yields a corresponding answer. The subsequent turns can\nreflect, verify, revise, or explore alternative approaches to both the thinking\nand answer parts of earlier ones. This not only makes the answer delivered more\nswiftly, but also enables explicit controls over the iterative reasoning\nprocess (i.e., users may halt or continue at any turn).

The resultant\nrefactored low-rank adaptation (RefLoRA) method promotes a flatter loss\nlandscape, along with consistent and balanced weight updates, thus speeding up\nstable convergence. Extensive experiments evaluate RefLoRA on natural language\nunderstanding, and commonsense reasoning tasks with popular large language\nmodels including DeBERTaV3, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B. The numerical\ntests corroborate that RefLoRA converges faster, outperforms various\nbenchmarks, and enjoys negligible computational overhead compared to\nstate-of-the-art LoRA variants."}

Specifically, we explore four\nfoundational questions: (1) how to best harness an LLM's internal heuristics to\nformulate the fine-grained hypothesis it itself would judge as the most\npromising among all the possible hypotheses it might generate, based on its own\ninternal scoring-thus defining a latent reward landscape over the hypothesis\nspace; (2) whether such LLM-judged better hypotheses exhibit stronger alignment\nwith ground-truth hypotheses; (3) whether shaping the reward landscape using an\nensemble of diverse LLMs of similar capacity yields better outcomes than\ndefining it with repeated instances of the strongest LLM among them; and (4)\nwhether an ensemble of identical LLMs provides a more reliable reward landscape\nthan a single LLM. To address these questions, we propose a hierarchical search\nmethod that incrementally proposes and integrates details into the hypothesis,\nprogressing from general concepts to specific experimental configurations. We\nshow that this hierarchical process smooths the reward landscape and enables\nmore effective optimization. Empirical evaluations on a new benchmark of\nexpert-annotated fine-grained hypotheses from recent chemistry literature show\nthat our method consistently outperforms strong baselines."}

To address this challenge,\nwe propose two algorithms: Off-C$^2$LUB, which we analytically show performs\nwell for arbitrary amounts of user data, and Off-CLUB, which is prone to bias\nwhen data is limited but, given sufficient data, matches a theoretical lower\nbound that we derive for the offline clustered MAB problem. We experimentally\nvalidate these results on both real and synthetic datasets."}

While\nintegrating LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) provides access to structured,\nverifiable information, existing approaches often generate incomplete or\nfactually inconsistent reasoning paths. To this end, we propose Self-Reflective\nPlanning (SRP), a framework that synergizes LLMs with KGs through iterative,\nreference-guided reasoning. Specifically, given a question and topic entities,\nSRP first searches for references to guide planning and reflection. In the\nplanning process, it checks initial relations and generates a reasoning path.\nAfter retrieving knowledge from KGs through a reasoning path, it implements\niterative reflection by judging the retrieval result and editing the reasoning\npath until the answer is correctly retrieved.

OptiMindTune leverages\nthe collaborative intelligence of three specialized AI agents -- a Recommender\nAgent, an Evaluator Agent, and a Decision Agent -- each powered by Google's\nGemini models. These agents address distinct facets of the HPO problem, from\nmodel selection and hyperparameter suggestion to robust evaluation and\nstrategic decision-making. By fostering dynamic interactions and knowledge\nsharing, OptiMindTune aims to converge to optimal hyperparameter configurations\nmore rapidly and robustly than existing single-agent or monolithic approaches.\nOur framework integrates principles from advanced large language models, and\nadaptive search to achieve scalable and intelligent AutoML. We posit that this\nmulti-agent paradigm offers a promising avenue for tackling the increasing\ncomplexity of modern machine learning model tuning."}

These works suggest that\nthe difficulty is linked to the heavy-tailed distribution of words in text\ndata, where the frequency of the $k$th most frequent word $\\pi_k$ is\nproportional to $1/k$, following Zipf's law. To better understand the impact of\nthe data distribution on training performance, we study a linear bigram model\nfor next-token prediction when the tokens follow a power law $\\pi_k \\propto\n1/k^\\alpha$ parameterized by the exponent $\\alpha > 0$. We derive optimization\nscaling laws for deterministic gradient descent and sign descent as a proxy for\nAdam as a function of the exponent $\\alpha$. Existing theoretical\ninvestigations in scaling laws assume that the eigenvalues of the data decay as\na power law with exponent $\\alpha > 1$. This assumption effectively makes the\nproblem ``finite dimensional'' as most of the loss comes from a few of the\nlargest eigencomponents. In comparison, we show that the problem is more\ndifficult when the data have heavier tails. The case $\\alpha = 1$ as found in\ntext data is ``worst-case'' for gradient descent, in that the number of\niterations required to reach a small relative error scales almost linearly with\ndimension. While the performance of sign descent also depends on the dimension,\nfor Zipf-distributed data the number of iterations scales only with the\nsquare-root of the dimension, leading to a large improvement for large\nvocabularies."}

In\nthis paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of\nbackdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We\ndemonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit\nbatched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling\nlarge-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching\nprocess, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between\nconcurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses\ndirected at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who\ncan change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of\nother users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only\nfeasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent\nmodel architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and\nsystem integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities,\nwe propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees\nagainst this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language\nModels to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel\nInformation Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves\nnon-interference between different user inputs within the same batch.

This phenomenon,\nnamed multiplicity, is not a side-effect of noise or annotation error, but an\ninevitable outcome of semantic abstraction, representational asymmetry, and\ntask-dependent ambiguity in multimodal tasks. This position paper argues that\nmultiplicity is a fundamental bottleneck that manifests across all stages of\nthe multimodal learning pipeline: from data construction to training and\nevaluation. This paper examines the causes and consequences of multiplicity,\nand highlights how multiplicity introduces training uncertainty, unreliable\nevaluation, and low dataset quality. This position calls for new research\ndirections on multimodal learning: novel multiplicity-aware learning frameworks\nand dataset construction protocols considering multiplicity."}

We address these limitations with a\ngenerative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition\nthat lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single\nlook-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and\nreceives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating\noptimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and\n(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating\nexhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an\nenvironment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and\nlong-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism\nyields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision\nmaking in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or\nexpensive planning."}

We first\nidentify two key limitations in existing LLM-based algorithm evolution\ntechniques: code bloat and a lack of semantic guidance. Bloat results in\nunnecessarily complex components, and the absence of semantic awareness can\nlead to ineffective exchange of useful code components, both of which can\nreduce the interpretability of the designed algorithm or hinder evolutionary\nlearning progress. To address these issues, we enhance the LLM-based evolution\nframework for meta symbolic regression with two key innovations: bloat control\nand a complementary, semantics-aware selection operator. Additionally, we embed\ndomain knowledge into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate more effective\nand contextually relevant selection operators. Our experimental results on\nsymbolic regression benchmarks show that LLMs can devise selection operators\nthat outperform nine expert-designed baselines, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance. This demonstrates that LLMs can exceed expert-level algorithm\ndesign for symbolic regression."}

Second, the current paradigm of\nfine-tuning the backbone LM of a neural recommender on task-specific data is\ncomputationally expensive and infeasible in few-shot recommendation and\ncold-start setups, where data is scarce or completely unavailable. In this\nwork, we propose a news-adapted sentence encoder (NaSE), domain-specialized\nfrom a pretrained massively multilingual sentence encoder (SE). To this end, we\nconstruct and leverage PolyNews and PolyNewsParallel, two multilingual\nnews-specific corpora. With the news-adapted multilingual SE in place, we test\nthe effectiveness of (i.e., question the need for) supervised fine-tuning for\nnews recommendation, and propose a simple and strong baseline based on (i)\nfrozen NaSE embeddings and (ii) late click-behavior fusion.

First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which\nreformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to more\nrealistic training settings. Empirically, we find that both a CNN and a\nTransformer model are replicated accurately by this reformulation. Second, we\nderive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature\nmaps. We show their effectiveness in parameter pruning that is comparable to\nexisting methods, reinforcing their value for model component attribution.\nFinally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training\nprocess, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking.\nAmong other things, our findings support previously proposed stages of\nGrokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input\nembeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the\nmemorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded,\nunified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics."}

How to effectively leverage\ntraining images with diverse qualities becomes a problem in learning deep\nmodels. Conventional training mechanisms, such as self-paced curriculum\nlearning (SCL) and online hard example mining (OHEM), relieve this problem by\nreweighting images with high loss values.

To address these issues, this paper revisits the minibatch\nsampling (MBS), a technique widely used in deep network training but largely\nunexplored concerning the handling of diverse-quality training samples. We\ndiscover that the samples within a minibatch influence each other during\ntraining; thus, we propose a novel Mixed-order Minibatch Sampling (MoMBS)\nmethod to optimize the use of training samples with diverse qualities. MoMBS\nintroduces a measure that takes both loss and uncertainty into account to\nsurpass a sole reliance on loss and allows for a more refined categorization of\nhigh-loss samples by distinguishing them as either poorly labeled and under\nrepresented or well represented and overfitted. We prioritize under represented\nsamples as the main gradient contributors in a minibatch and keep them from the\nnegative influences of poorly labeled or overfitted samples with a mixed-order\nminibatch sampling design."}

Through large-scale empirical analyses spanning over\n300 training runs, carefully controlled for data scale and quality, we show\nthat data diversity can be a strong predictor of generalization in LLM\nreasoning -- as measured by average model performance on unseen\nout-of-distribution benchmarks. We introduce G-Vendi, a metric that quantifies\ndiversity via the entropy of model-induced gradients.

To overcome these challenges, we\npropose Lagrangian-Optimized Robust Embeddings (LORE), a novel unsupervised\nadversarial fine-tuning framework. LORE utilizes constrained optimization,\nwhich offers a principled approach to balancing competing goals, such as\nimproving robustness while preserving nominal performance. By enforcing\nembedding-space proximity constraints, LORE effectively maintains clean data\nperformance throughout adversarial fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that\nLORE significantly improves zero-shot adversarial robustness with minimal\ndegradation in clean data accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the adversarially fine-tuned CLIP image encoder in\nout-of-distribution generalization and enhancing the interpretability of image\nembeddings."}

More specifically, RedAHD\nemploys LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP\nat hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based\nheuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving\nthe transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our\nexperimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of\ndesigning heuristics with competitive or improved results over the\nstate-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement."}

To address these\nshortcomings, we introduce a novel multi-modal Co-AttenDWG architecture that\nleverages dual-path encoding, co-attention with dimension-wise gating, and\nadvanced expert fusion. Our approach begins by projecting text and image\nfeatures into a common embedding space, where a dedicated co-attention\nmechanism enables simultaneous, fine-grained interactions between modalities.\nThis mechanism is further enhanced by a dimension-wise gating network that\nadaptively regulates the feature contributions at the channel level, ensuring\nthat only the most relevant information is emphasized. In parallel, dual-path\nencoders refine the representations by processing cross-modal information\nseparately before an additional cross-attention layer further aligns\nmodalities. The refined features are then aggregated via an expert fusion\nmodule that combines learned gating and self-attention to produce a robust,\nunified representation. We validate our approach on the MIMIC and SemEval\nMemotion 1.0, where experimental results demonstrate significant improvements\nin cross-modal alignment and state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the\npotential of our model for a wide range of multi-modal applications."}

Although recognizing diagrams is essential for vision language\nmodels (VLMs) to comprehend domain-specific knowledge, recent studies reveal\nthat many VLMs fail to identify edges in images. We hypothesize that these\nfailures stem from an over-reliance on textual and positional biases,\npreventing VLMs from learning explicit edge features. Based on this idea, we\nempirically investigate whether the image encoder in VLMs can learn edge\nrepresentation through training on a diagram dataset in which edges are biased\nneither by textual nor positional information. To this end, we conduct\ncontrastive learning on an artificially generated diagram--caption dataset to\ntrain an image encoder and evaluate its diagram-related features on three\ntasks: probing, image retrieval, and captioning. Our results show that the\nfinetuned model outperforms pretrained CLIP in all tasks and surpasses\nzero-shot GPT-4o and LLaVA-Mistral in the captioning task.

In this work,\nwe begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover\noriginal prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across\nmultiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are\nnearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs,\ndemonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes.

This raises the question of how accurately these\nmulti-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in\nmulti-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in\nstudying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such\nmulti-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates\ninformation across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to\nhigher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and\ntwo types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine\nwhich type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants\nare engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal\nmodels show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This\nstudy also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus\nmulti-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each\nmodality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one\nby one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional\ninformation beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and\nlanguage regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for\ncross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video\nmodality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the\nvideo and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the\nneuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for\ndeepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain."}

This paper explores how\nto effectively address this issue. Our key motivation is that as more tokens\nare generated during the autoregressive process, subsequent tokens follow more\nconstrained distributions and are easier to sample. To intuitively explain, if\na model has generated part of a dog, the remaining tokens must complete the dog\nand thus are more constrained. Empirical evidence supports our motivation: at\nlater generation stages, the next tokens can be well predicted by a multilayer\nperceptron, exhibit low variance, and follow closer-to-straight-line denoising\npaths from noise to tokens. Based on our finding, we introduce diffusion step\nannealing (DiSA), a training-free method which gradually uses fewer diffusion\nsteps as more tokens are generated, e.g., using 50 steps at the beginning and\ngradually decreasing to 5 steps at later stages. Because DiSA is derived from\nour finding specific to diffusion in autoregressive models, it is complementary\nto existing acceleration methods designed for diffusion alone. DiSA can be\nimplemented in only a few lines of code on existing models, and albeit simple,\nachieves $5-10\\times$ faster inference for MAR and Harmon and $1.4-2.5\\times$\nfor FlowAR and xAR, while maintaining the generation quality."}

Large Language Models\n(LLMs) offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address\nthis gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, Fin-Force-FINancial FORward\nCounterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing\nstructured evaluation, Fin-Force supports LLM based forward counterfactual\ngeneration. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for\nexploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing\nstructured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on Fin-Force, we\nevaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing\ntheir limitations and proposing insights for future research."}

Such a hallucination issue\nhinders LVLMs' applicability in the real world. The key to solving\nhallucination in LVLM is to make the text generation rely more on the visual\ncontent. Most previous works choose to enhance/adjust the features/output of a\nspecific modality (i.e., visual or textual) to alleviate hallucinations in\nLVLM, which do not explicitly or systematically enhance the visual reliance. In\nthis paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the\nvisual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective. Based\non our observations, we propose to mitigate hallucination in LVLM from three\naspects. Firstly, we observe that not all visual tokens are informative in\ngenerating meaningful texts. We propose to evaluate and remove redundant visual\ntokens to avoid their disturbance. Secondly, LVLM may encode inappropriate\nprior information, making it lean toward generating unexpected words. We\npropose a simple yet effective way to rectify the prior from a Bayesian\nperspective. Thirdly, we observe that starting from certain steps, the\nposterior of next-token prediction conditioned on visual tokens may collapse to\na prior distribution which does not depend on any informative visual tokens at\nall. Thus, we propose to stop further text generation to avoid hallucination.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmarks including POPE, CHAIR, and MME\ndemonstrate that our method can consistently mitigate the hallucination issue\nof LVLM and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts."}

To\naddress this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual\nrecommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three\ntypical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start\nrecommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and\nstudying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark\ncomparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings\ndemonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design\nguidelines for their core components.

By\nassessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our\nframework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose\nthe most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such\ncompressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves\nrobustness, although it is insufficient in some cases.

Some\nof the knowledge may actually bring detrimental effects to the fine-tuning\ntasks, which is also known as negative transfer.

In spite of this,\nno thorough evaluation has been proposed for Italian texts. This research tries\nto fill the gap by proposing a new challenging dataset for entity extraction\nbased on a corpus of 19th century scholarly notes, i.e. Giacomo Leopardi's\nZibaldone (1898), containing 2,899 references to people, locations and literary\nworks. This dataset was used to carry out reproducible experiments with both\ndomain-specific BERT-based models and state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMa3.1.\nResults show that instruction-tuned models encounter multiple difficulties\nhandling historical humanistic texts, while fine-tuned NER models offer more\nrobust performance even with challenging entity types such as bibliographic\nreferences."}

Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated\ncode blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from\nthe HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we\nexpected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed.

Since multimodal reasoning\ncovers a wider range of tasks compared to text-only scenarios, the resulting\ndistribution shift from the training to testing sets is more severe, leading to\ngreater generalization difficulty. Training a reliable multimodal PRM,\ntherefore, demands large and diverse datasets to ensure sufficient coverage.\nHowever, current multimodal reasoning datasets suffer from a marked quality\nimbalance, which degrades PRM performance and highlights the need for an\neffective data selection strategy.

It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving 66.50% coverage (+9.49%) with efficient trajectories and improved\nmapping accuracy on 128 unseen complex scenes.

But is this all we can do? We argue that in the output space of LLMs,\nthe space of strings, exist strings expressive enough to summarize the\ndistribution over output strings the LLM deems possible. We lay a foundation\nfor this new avenue of uncertainty explication and present SelfReflect, a\ntheoretically-motivated metric to assess how faithfully a string summarizes an\nLLM's internal answer distribution. We show that SelfReflect is able to\ndiscriminate even subtle differences of candidate summary strings and that it\naligns with human judgement, outperforming alternative metrics such as LLM\njudges and embedding comparisons. With SelfReflect, we investigate a number of\nself-summarization methods and find that even state-of-the-art reasoning models\nstruggle to explicate their internal uncertainty. But we find that faithful\nsummarizations can be generated by sampling and summarizing. Our metric enables\nfuture works towards this universal form of LLM uncertainties."}

However, we argue that current reasoning\nLLMs (RLLMs) lack the ability to systematically explore the solution space.\nThis paper formalizes what constitutes systematic problem solving and\nidentifies common failure modes that reveal reasoning LLMs to be wanderers\nrather than systematic explorers. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis\nacross multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, we uncover persistent issues: invalid\nreasoning steps, redundant explorations, hallucinated or unfaithful\nconclusions, and so on. Our findings suggest that current models' performance\ncan appear to be competent on simple tasks yet degrade sharply as complexity\nincreases. Based on the findings, we advocate for new metrics and tools that\nevaluate not just final outputs but the structure of the reasoning process\nitself."}

Teaching large multimodal models (LMMs) to\nunderstand such narratives at a human-like level could help manga creators\nreflect on and refine their stories. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks\nfor multimodal manga understanding: MangaOCR, which targets in-page text\nrecognition, and MangaVQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate contextual\nunderstanding through visual question answering. MangaVQA consists of 526\nhigh-quality, manually constructed question-answer pairs, enabling reliable\nevaluation across diverse narrative and visual scenarios. Building on these\nbenchmarks, we develop MangaLMM, a manga-specialized model finetuned from the\nopen-source LMM Qwen2.5-VL to jointly handle both tasks. Through extensive\nexperiments, including comparisons with proprietary models such as GPT-4o and\nGemini 2.5, we assess how well LMMs understand manga. Our benchmark and model\nprovide a comprehensive foundation for evaluating and advancing LMMs in the\nrichly narrative domain of manga."}
